## Biography
The Modern Jazz Quartet (MJQ) was formed in 1952, evolving from the rhythm section of Dizzy Gillespie's big band, where pianist John Lewis, vibraphonist Milt Jackson, bassist Ray Brown, and drummer Kenny Clarke first played together in the late 1940s. After Ray Brown left and was replaced by Percy Heath, the group became the Milt Jackson Quartet before adopting the name Modern Jazz Quartet. In 1955, Connie Kay replaced Clarke, solidifying the classic MJQ lineup that endured for decades[2][3][4].

MJQ distinguished itself by blending jazz with classical influences, particularly baroque counterpoint, under the musical direction of John Lewis. Their sound was marked by elegant restraint, subtle swing, and sophisticated interplay, setting them apart from the more raucous bebop scene. Notable compositions like "Django" and "Bags' Groove" exemplified their approach. MJQ was also pioneering in presenting jazz in concert halls rather than nightclubs, elevating the genre's status and broadening its audience[2][3][4][8].

The group enjoyed international acclaim, especially after their first European tour in 1956. Despite a brief hiatus from 1974 to 1981, MJQ remained active until Connie Kay's death in 1994, making them one of the longest-running ensembles in jazz history. Their legacy includes a profound influence on both jazz performance practice and the integration of classical techniques into jazz composition[2][1][3].
