## Biography
Alexey Marti is a Cuban-born percussionist, composer, and bandleader renowned for his dynamic contributions to Latin jazz and Afro-Cuban music. Born in Havana, Cuba, Marti began his musical journey playing conga drums as a child within his family, absorbing the island’s deep African-rooted traditions. His formal education in percussion started at age 16 under the mentorship of Maestro Oscar Valdes, the legendary percussionist and singer for Irakere. This mentorship led to a professional tenure with Valdes’ Afro-Cuban ensemble Dia.kara, where Marti honed his craft and deepened his understanding of Afro-Cuban rhythms and folklore.[1][2]

In 2008, Marti relocated to New Orleans, Louisiana, immersing himself in the city’s vibrant musical culture and enrolling in the University of New Orleans Jazz Program to study percussion and piano. He quickly became a fixture in the local scene, founding the Latin-funk-fusion quintet Alexey Marti and Urban Minds, and opening for Chucho Valdes in 2012. Marti’s innovative approach blends Cuban folkloric and contemporary traditions with West African spiritual drumming, New Orleans jazz, blues, funk, and second line rhythms, resulting in a fresh, cross-cultural sound. He has released two acclaimed albums, 'Travesia' (2017) and 'Mundo' (2019), both celebrated for their inventive arrangements and cosmopolitan influences.[1][2][3][4]

Marti’s career is marked by collaborations with notable artists such as The Headhunters, Delfeayo Marsalis, Orlando Maraca Valle, Horacio “El Negro” Hernandez, and the Louisiana Philharmonic Orchestra. He is a regular performer at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival and has been recognized with multiple Big Easy Music Award nominations, winning Best Performer in the Latin and World Music category in 2018. Marti continues to expand his artistic reach, composing for film and television, and inspiring audiences with his audience-participatory performances and celebratory spirit.[1][2][3]

## Fun Facts
- Marti’s album 'Mundo' was recorded in multiple cities across the Americas and Europe, including New Orleans, Miami, New York, Havana, Brazil, Puerto Rico, and Spain, reflecting its cosmopolitan sound.[2]
- He has performed regularly at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival since 2009, becoming a staple of the event.[1]
- Marti composed music for the TV series 'Roots' (2016) and for documentaries such as 'Chasing Dreams: A Leah Chase Story' and 'Codigo Color Memorias.'[1]
- He is largely self-taught, supplementing his formal studies with intensive daily practice sessions of up to 12 hours, and by observing rehearsals of top Cuban musicians.[2]
