## Biography
Bass Drum of Death is a **garage-punk / lo-fi rock band** founded as the solo project of singer, guitarist, and multi-instrumentalist **John Barrett** in Oxford, Mississippi, around 2007–2008.[3][4][5] Barrett, who moved to Oxford at age seven, briefly studied at the University of Mississippi before dropping out in 2008 to focus on music, by which time he had already been recording under the Bass Drum of Death name for about a year.[4] Early on, he crafted raw, DIY recordings at home, playing nearly all the instruments himself and channeling distorted blues, surf, and punk energy into fuzz-heavy songs that fit squarely into the then-emerging garage rock resurgence.[3][4] His first official release, the EP *Stain Stick Skin*, appeared on Fat Possum Records in 2008, followed by the full-length debut *GB City* in 2011, whose tracks “Young Pros,” “Velvet Itch,” “Get Found,” and “Nerve Jamming” helped build a cult following through tours and prominent placements in films, video games, and TV.[3][4]

Across the 2010s, Barrett expanded Bass Drum of Death from a one-man studio project into a full band, recruiting drummers like **Colin Sneed** for early tours and later working regularly with drummer **Len Clark** (ex–Colour Revolt) and guitarist **Josh Hunter**.[3][4] A self-titled second album, *Bass Drum of Death* (2013), released via Innovative Leisure, and subsequent records deepened the band’s reputation for blown-out riffs, hooky melodies, and a gritty blend of garage rock, surf rock, and indie punk.[3] By the late 2010s and early 2020s, Bass Drum of Death had operated out of New York for several years, then relocated back to Oxford and re-signed with Fat Possum; they continued evolving from a largely solo recording vehicle into a more collaborative unit—including Barrett’s brother **Jim Barrett** on guitar and drummer **Ian Kirkpatrick**—while returning to the raw, lo-fi spirit of the early recordings on later albums such as *SAY I WON’T* and *SIX*.[2][7][8] Throughout, the project’s legacy has rested on its role in sustaining modern American garage rock: loud, unvarnished, and rooted in Southern DIY culture, yet widely recognized through international touring and recurring sync placements in popular media.[4][7]

## Fun Facts
- Bass Drum of Death began as a true one-man band, with John Barrett writing, recording, singing, and playing all instruments on early releases before he could afford to bring in other musicians.[3][4]
- Songs from the debut album *GB City* have appeared across pop culture: “Velvet Itch” was used in the film *Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance*, “Get Found” was featured in the video game *Major League Baseball 2K12*, and “Nerve Jamming” appeared in the BBC series *Waterloo Road*.[4]
- Barrett dropped out of the University of Mississippi after about a year and a half specifically to pursue Bass Drum of Death full time, having already started the project while still a student.[4]
- The project has shifted homes between respected indie labels: the first EP and debut album came out on Oxford’s Fat Possum Records, the self-titled second album appeared on Innovative Leisure, and later work—including *Say I Won’t*—returned to Fat Possum, reinforcing the band’s connection to its Mississippi roots.[3][2][8]
