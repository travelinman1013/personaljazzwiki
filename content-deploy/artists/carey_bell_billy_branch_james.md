## Biography
Carey Bell Harrington was born on November 14, 1936, in Macon, Mississippi, and began playing harmonica as a child, coming under the guidance of pianist Lovie Lee in nearby Meridian during his teens. In the mid-1950s, Lee brought Bell to Chicago, where he navigated a shifting blues scene dominated by electric guitars, often playing bass to support himself while performing harmonica with guitarists like Eddie Taylor and Royal Johnson on the West Side. His early career included session work and tours, such as with Earl Hooker, and his debut album *Carey's Bell's Blues Harp* on Delmark Records in 1969 marked the start of his solo recognition.[1][3]
