## Biography
Carlos del Junco was born in Havana, Cuba, and immigrated to North America with his family at the age of one. He first picked up a harmonica at age 14, beginning what would become a distinguished career as a blues musician and harmonica virtuoso. His life changed significantly in the late 1980s when he enrolled in a music camp at Elkins, West Virginia, where he studied under the renowned harmonica master Howard Levy, a pivotal moment that shaped his musical development and technical approach.

Del Junco has become recognized as a pioneer of the 10-hole diatonic harmonica, developing a unique ability to play chromatically through an advanced overblow technique. This innovation has allowed him to expand the expressive capabilities of the instrument beyond its traditional limitations. Throughout his career, he has performed extensively with his four-piece band, The Blues Mongrels, touring across Canada, the United States, and Europe, establishing himself as a respected figure in the contemporary blues scene.

With over 30 years of experience in music education, del Junco has dedicated significant time to teaching both private and group lessons, conducting workshops and master classes throughout Canada, Europe, and the United States. His contributions to blues harmonica performance and education have solidified his reputation as a harmonica maestro, combining technical innovation with a deep commitment to sharing his knowledge with the next generation of musicians.
