## Biography
Natural Self is the ongoing project of Nathaniel Pearn, a Brighton-based producer, vocalist, and DJ originally inspired by the rhythmic force of The Bomb Squad's productions for Public Enemy. Hip hop served as his primary early influence, expanding through crate digging into funk, soul, jazz, Latin, electronica, and beyond. By 2001, he debuted with the 'Shakedown/The Soul Step' single on Breakin’ Bread records, showcasing raw drums, polyrhythmic percussion, and strident horns that became his signature sound, honed by seven years of DJing experience.[1][2]

Pearn's career evolved with his 2006 debut album 'Let Peace Be The Ruler', introducing live recordings and a collaboration with Alice Russell on 'I Don’t Need This Trouble', alongside a joint album 'Gravity' with Nostalgia 77 as The Broken Keys. He ventured into singing on this release and continued developing his style with the 2008 Tru Thoughts album 'The Art Of Vibration', featuring Andreya Triana and electronic excursions. Further works included 'My Heart Beats Like A Drum' in 2009 with Elodie Rama and the 2013 album 'Neon Hunts My Eyes', marking a shift to singer-songwriter territory with themes of technology, environment, and time, blending beat-heavy synths with warmth and nostalgia.[1]

His musical style fuses nu jazz, funk, hip hop, and electronic elements with deep percussive vibes, evolving from dancefloor-focused tracks to broader tropical and bass influences. As a remixer and DJ, Pearn has toured the UK, Europe, and America, maintaining a demand for his distinctive productions that balance energy, heart, and rhythmic drive.[1][2][3]
