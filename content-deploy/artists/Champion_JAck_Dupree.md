## Biography
Champion Jack Dupree, born William Thomas Dupree in New Orleans (either July 23, 1909 or July 4, 1910), was a seminal figure in the evolution of blues and boogie-woogie piano. Orphaned at a young age after his parents died in a house fire, Dupree was raised in the Colored Waifs Home for Boys, where he taught himself piano and absorbed the rich musical traditions of New Orleans. He later apprenticed with local piano masters, developing a robust, percussive style that became his signature. As a teenager, he sang in Storyville bars and later trained as a boxer, earning the nickname 'Champion Jack.'

Dupree's career took him from the barrelhouses of New Orleans to the blues scenes of Chicago, Indianapolis, and New York. His 1940s recordings for OKeh Records, including the influential 'Junker Blues,' established him as a major voice in blues. In the 1950s, he moved to Europe, where he became a fixture on the club and festival circuit, collaborating with British and European jazz and blues musicians. His 1958 album 'Blues from the Gutter' is considered a classic, noted for its raw lyrical themes and powerful piano work. Dupree continued to record and perform internationally until his death in Hanover, Germany, in 1992.

Dupree's music blended traditional New Orleans blues with topical lyrics and boogie-woogie rhythms, influencing generations of rhythm and blues musicians. His earthy vocal delivery and rollicking piano style preserved the spirit of early New Orleans music, and his legacy endures through his recordings and the many artists he inspired.
