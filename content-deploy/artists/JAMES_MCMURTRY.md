## Biography
James McMurtry, born March 18, 1962, in Fort Worth, Texas, is a celebrated American singer-songwriter, guitarist, and bandleader whose music spans alt country, Americana, outlaw country, Texas country, red dirt, and roots rock. The son of Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Larry McMurtry, James grew up immersed in literature and music, with early exposure to Johnny Cash and Roy Acuff records shaping his musical tastes[1][2]. His mother, an English professor, taught him his first guitar chords at age seven, and he developed his skills largely by ear and through observation[3]. McMurtry’s career began in earnest with his 1989 debut album, Too Long in the Wasteland, produced by John Mellencamp, which established him as a distinctive voice in American roots music[1][2]. Over the decades, McMurtry has released a series of critically acclaimed albums, including Candyland (1992), Where’d You Hide the Body (1995), and It Had to Happen (1997), the latter earning the American Indie Award for Best Americana Album[2][3]. His 2005 album Childish Things spent six weeks at No. 1 on the Americana Music Radio Chart and won Album of the Year at the Americana Music Awards, while its standout track “We Can’t Make It Here” was named Song of the Year[1][2]. McMurtry’s songwriting is renowned for its sharp sociopolitical commentary, vivid storytelling, and unflinching portrayal of American life, cementing his legacy as one of the most literate and incisive songwriters of his generation[1].

## Fun Facts
- James McMurtry is also an occasional actor, with roles in films such as Daisy Miller and Lonesome Dove, the latter based on his father’s novel[2][3].
