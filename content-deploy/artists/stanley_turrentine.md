## Biography
Stanley William Turrentine, nicknamed 'Mr. T' or 'The Sugar Man,' was born on April 5, 1934, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, into a musical family; his father was a saxophonist, and his older brother Tommy played trumpet. He began playing saxophone early, inspired by his father's technique, and started his professional career at age 17 touring with Lowell Fulson's blues band in 1951 alongside Ray Charles. In 1953, he joined Earl Bostic's band, replacing John Coltrane, and later worked with Tadd Dameron; his only formal musical training came during a mid-1950s military stint, after which he joined Max Roach's band in 1959[1][2][3][4][5].

Turrentine rose to prominence in the 1960s with Blue Note Records, signing in 1960 after session work with Jimmy Smith on albums like *Back at the Chicken Shack*. He married organist Shirley Scott that year, forming a key soul jazz duo; they recorded together extensively until their 1971 divorce, producing works like *Hustlin'* (1964). His style blended hard bop, soul jazz, blues, and bebop influences, characterized by a big, warm, blues-drenched tenor saxophone tone, as heard in leader debuts like *Look Out!* (1960). In the 1970s, he explored jazz fusion with CTI, achieving commercial success with *Sugar* (1970) and *Don't Mess with Mister T.* (1973)[1][2][4][5].

Returning to soul jazz in the 1980s and 1990s, Turrentine earned four Grammy nominations and a #1 hit, cementing his legacy as a versatile tenor saxophonist bridging R&B, jazz, and fusion. He passed away on September 12, 2000[1][2].
