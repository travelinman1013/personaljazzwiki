# Rufus, Chaka Khan

## Biography
Chaka Khan, born Yvette Marie Stevens on March 23, 1953, at the Great Lakes Naval Training Center in Illinois, grew up in Chicago and began her musical journey in local bands during her teens. She adopted the name Chaka Khan after marrying Hassan Khan at age 17 and was recruited in 1972 by the funk band Rufus to replace departing singer Paulette McWilliams, marking the start of her rise to prominence. With Rufus, a multiracial Chicago-based group blending funk, rock, and soul, Khan's powerful, fiery vocals became the centerpiece, propelling them to fame after signing with ABC Records in 1973.[2][3][5]

Rufus achieved breakthrough success with their 1974 album *Rags to Rufus*, featuring Stevie Wonder's 'Tell Me Something Good,' which hit No. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100 and earned a Grammy. Hits like 'Sweet Thing' (co-written by Khan and guitarist Tony Maiden) followed, alongside albums such as *Rufus Featuring Chaka Khan* (1975) and *Ask Rufus* (1977), yielding multiple No. 1 R&B singles and platinum sales. Tensions arose, particularly with drummer Andre Fischer, leading to lineup changes and Khan's solo signing in 1978, though she fulfilled contract obligations with Rufus on projects like *Masterjam* (1979, produced by Quincy Jones) and the 1983 hit 'Ain't Nobody.'[1][2][3]

Khan's style fused seductive fire, soulful depth, and funk grooves, earning her the 'Queen of Funk' title. Post-Rufus, her solo career thrived with Gold albums like *Chaka* (1978), cementing a five-decade legacy as a vocal powerhouse influencing funk and R&B, with Rufus remembered as one of the 1970s' top acts.[2][3][4]
