## Biography
The Original Pinettes Brass Band, the world's only all-female brass band, was founded in 1991 at St. Mary's Academy, a Catholic girls' school in New Orleans, Louisiana, under the direction of band director Jeffery C. Herbert. Initially comprising about 16 students from the school's marching band, they began playing New Orleans-style jazz, later shifting to contemporary brass band music inspired by groups like Rebirth Brass Band after a positive crowd response at a 1992 spring concert. Herbert, drawing from his own Original Pinstripe Brass Band, named them the Pinettes and managed them even after leaving St. Mary's in 1993-94 for John McDonogh High School and later Southern University in 1998, at which point the band took over self-management. They performed in second-line parades and released a cassette tape, though with limited success beyond New Orleans.[1][2][3][5]

The band faced significant challenges, including high member turnover and the devastation of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, which displaced members to cities like Houston. Bandleader Christie Jourdain, originally a snare drum alternate, assumed leadership upon returns to New Orleans, recruiting new members from diverse local schools such as Eleanor McMain, McDonogh 35, Warren Easton, and Xavier University Preparatory to sustain the group. A dispute with former members led to their name change to The Original Pinettes Brass Band. Their breakthrough came in 2013 when they won the Red Bull Street Kings competition against three male brass bands, dubbing themselves 'Street Queens,' and released their debut full-length album *Finally* after 22 years.[1][2][3][5]

Known for their high-energy New Orleans brass band style blending traditional jazz with modern improvisation, the Pinettes have performed at major festivals including Essence Festival (consistent openers since 2012), French Quarter Fest, Satchmo Festival, Jazz & Heritage Festival, and internationally in Turkey (Istanbul, Izmir, Ankara) and Switzerland's Ascona Jazz Fest. Notable collaborations include opening for Arcade Fire at Voodoo Fest (2021) and another show (2022) where they adapted 'Electric Blue,' and performing with rapper Mia X at French Quarter Fest 2024.[1][2][3]
