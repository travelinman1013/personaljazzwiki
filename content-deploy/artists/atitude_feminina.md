## Biography
Atitude Feminina is a pioneering Brazilian hip-hop group formed in 2000 in São Sebastião, Distrito Federal, by friends Jane, Hellen (Helen Rosa Silva), Giza Black, and Aninha (Ana Cecília dos Santos). Emerging from the outskirts of Brasília, the group quickly gained recognition for their powerful lyrics addressing the underrepresentation of women in hip-hop, domestic violence, and discrimination against women in Brazilian society. Their early participation in the Abril Pro Rap festival in 2001 and 2002, despite not reaching the finals, marked the beginning of their public journey and led to further invitations and visibility within the national rap scene.[2][1][4]

Throughout their career, Atitude Feminina has become known for their socially conscious music, blending traditional hip-hop with Brazilian rhythms and contemporary production. Their debut album, 'Rosas' (2006), featured the acclaimed title track, which won the Prêmio Hutúz and became an anthem against domestic violence. Subsequent releases, including 'Desistir Jamais' (2013), 'Nossa História' (2015), and 'Tipo Criminoso' (2018), continued to address themes of empowerment, identity, and resilience. The group, now primarily a duo of Hellen and Aninha, has performed across Brazil and internationally, including in Cabo Verde, and remains a significant voice for gender equality and social justice in Brazilian hip-hop.[2][4][5]

Atitude Feminina's legacy lies in their unwavering commitment to amplifying women's voices in rap and challenging societal norms through music. Their influence extends beyond their discography, inspiring a new generation of female MCs and activists in Brazil's vibrant hip-hop community.[2][5]
