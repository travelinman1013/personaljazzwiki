## Biography
Maxwell, born Gerald Maxwell Rivera on May 23, 1973, in Brooklyn, New York, is a pivotal figure in the neo-soul movement, celebrated for his smooth vocals and sophisticated blend of R&B, soul, and funk. Raised by his Puerto Rican mother after the tragic loss of his West Indian father in a plane crash when Maxwell was just three, he found solace in music, singing in his mother's church and immersing himself in the spiritual and emotional depth that would later define his artistry. As a teenager, Maxwell worked multiple jobs to support himself and purchase musical instruments, developing both his musical and social skills in the process.

Maxwell began composing music at 17, using a borrowed Casio keyboard, and quickly became a fixture in New York City's club scene by the early 1990s. His demo tapes and live performances, including a notable debut at Manhattan's Nell's, attracted significant attention and led to a contract with Columbia Records in 1994. His debut album, 'Maxwell's Urban Hang Suite' (1996), though initially met with skepticism by his label, became a critical and commercial success, earning Grammy nominations and helping to define the late 1990s neo-soul sound alongside artists like D'Angelo and Erykah Badu. Maxwell's subsequent albums, including 'Embrya' (1998), 'Now' (2001), and 'BLACKsummers'night' (2009), further cemented his reputation for lush, romantic, and introspective music, earning him multiple awards and a devoted following.

Known for his meticulous artistry, Maxwell produces, writes, and often plays much of his own material, drawing inspiration from classic soul while maintaining a modern sensibility. His music is characterized by its focus on romance and emotional vulnerability, steering clear of explicitness in favor of sensuality and spiritual depth. Maxwell's enduring influence is evident in the continued relevance of his work and his role in shaping the sound and ethos of contemporary R&B.
