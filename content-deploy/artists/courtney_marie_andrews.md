## Biography
Courtney Marie Andrews is an American singer, songwriter, musician, and poet known for her emotionally incisive blend of Americana, alt‑country, and folk. Born and raised around Phoenix, Arizona, she began singing in local karaoke bars with her mother and soon gravitated to the city’s folk scene, writing songs and performing in her teens.[4][6] By 16–17 she was already touring the West Coast, booking shows via MySpace, and shortly thereafter began releasing early self‑produced albums and EPs while still in high school.[1][6] Those formative years also brought extensive side‑person work, including backing vocal and keyboard duties for Arizona alt‑rock band Jimmy Eat World and “psychedelic” electric guitar for songwriter Damien Jurado, experiences that honed her skills on the road and in the studio.[1][5]

In her early twenties Andrews effectively hit reset on her career, moving from Arizona to the Pacific Northwest, leaving her first three records behind after what she has described as a bad early industry deal.[1][5] She settled around Seattle, supporting herself with bartending and service jobs while writing prolifically, splitting time between Belgium—where she lived for a period while touring with Belgian pop artist Milow—and Washington State.[1][5] This period produced the introspective albums “No One’s Slate Is Clean” (2012) and “On My Page” (2013), but her international breakthrough came with 2016’s “Honest Life,” largely inspired by the loneliness and rootlessness of constant touring.[1][3] Its critical success, especially in Europe, led to extensive touring across North America, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand and set the stage for 2018’s “May Your Kindness Remain,” recorded in Los Angeles with producer Mark Howard and widely praised for its warm, gospel‑tinged Americana sound.[1][3]

Andrews’ music is marked by a clear, high, emotive voice and narrative songwriting that explores heartbreak, working‑class struggles, and resilience with unvarnished honesty.[1][4] Her 2020 album “Old Flowers,” a stark, cathartic breakup record, earned a Grammy nomination for Best Americana Album and further cemented her reputation as one of her generation’s most affecting songwriters.[2][4] Beyond music she has published a book of poetry and exhibited her paintings, extending her artistic practice into other mediums.[2] She has received multiple UK Americana Awards, including International Artist of the Year and International Album of the Year for “May Your Kindness Remain,” and has shared stages with artists like John Prine, Brandi Carlile, and Irma Thomas, underscoring her standing within the contemporary Americana and alt‑country community.[1]

## Fun Facts
- She began singing as a child in Phoenix‑area karaoke bars with her mom, performing pop and country songs before moving into the local folk circuit as a teenager.[4][6]
- Andrews booked some of her earliest national tours herself through MySpace, riding Greyhound buses up and down the West Coast while still in school.[1][4][6]
- After a difficult early record deal, she has said she figuratively “erased” her first three albums from the world and considers 2012’s “No One’s Slate Is Clean” the true starting point of her current catalog.[1]
- Much of her breakthrough album “Honest Life” was written while she was living alone in Belgium, working as a touring backup singer and processing a major breakup—experiences that informed its themes of independence and loneliness.[1][5]
