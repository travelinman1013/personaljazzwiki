## Biography
Ancient Infinity Orchestra is a large, communal jazz ensemble founded and led by double-bassist and composer Ozzy Moysey, originating in Leeds, North of England—a region known for its vibrant, community-driven jazz scene. Formed after years of collaborative improvisation among friends and inspired by frequent pilgrimages to London’s Café Oto, the group was born from a desire to blend improvisational freedom with strong melodic writing. The ensemble’s name was inspired by a story about a drum named by Sun Ra, reflecting the group’s reverence for ancient and timeless musical traditions.

The orchestra features a rotating cast of 14-15 musicians, including saxophonists, double bassists, harpists, violinists, cellists, pianists, and a wide array of woodwinds and percussion, creating a sound that is both expansive and intimate. Their music draws deeply from the well of spiritual jazz, especially the soulful, meditative works of Pharoah Sanders, Alice and John Coltrane, while also channeling the Northern English jazz sensibility fostered by contemporaries like Matthew Halsall. Their debut album 'Rivers of Light' (2023, Gondwana Records) and follow-up 'It's Always About Love' showcase their melodic, improvisational approach, emphasizing togetherness, healing, and the joy of communal music-making.

Ancient Infinity Orchestra’s legacy is rooted in their commitment to community, inclusivity, and the celebration of musical friendship. Their performances and recordings are marked by a warm, honest, and deeply spiritual character, offering listeners a sense of connection and uplift through music that is both rooted in tradition and open to new influences.
