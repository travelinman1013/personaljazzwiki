## Biography
William Clarke was born on March 29, 1951, in Inglewood, California, to a blue-collar family who had relocated from Kentucky. Growing up in Southern California, Clarke was drawn to the blues after hearing early Rolling Stones albums, diverging from his peers who favored surf music. By age 16, he had left school to work in a factory, saving enough to buy his first harmonica. He soon immersed himself in the vibrant Los Angeles blues scene, sneaking into clubs to hear legends like T-Bone Walker and Big Mama Thornton. 

Clarke's career took shape in the late 1970s as he became a fixture in South Central LA blues clubs and began recording self-produced albums. His musical style was a powerful blend of Chicago blues harmonica, West Coast swing, and jazz influences, particularly notable for his mastery of the chromatic harmonica and his 'soul-jazz' approach. Clarke's breakthrough came after he left his machinist job in 1987 to pursue music full-time. Signing with Alligator Records in 1990, he released acclaimed albums like 'Blowin' Like Hell,' which won the W.C. Handy Award for Blues Song of the Year. He toured extensively in the U.S. and Europe, earning a reputation as one of the most dynamic and inventive harmonica players of his generation.

Despite facing personal and health challenges, Clarke's legacy endures through his recordings and influence on contemporary blues harmonica. He passed away on November 2, 1996, in Fresno, California, at the age of 45, leaving behind a body of work celebrated for its soulful energy and technical brilliance.
