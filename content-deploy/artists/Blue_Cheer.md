## Biography
Blue Cheer, a San Francisco-based band active primarily in the late 1960s and early 1970s, with sporadic activity until 2009, significantly impacted the development of several rock subgenres.  Founded in 1966 by Dickie Peterson, who previously played with the Oxford Circle alongside future Blue Cheer members Paul Whaley and Gary Lee Yoder, the band initially featured Peterson on vocals and bass, Leigh Stephens on guitar, and Eric Albronda on drums.  Albronda later transitioned to management and production roles for the band, co-producing five of their albums.  The band's early lineup also included Jerre Peterson (Dickie's brother) on guitar, Vale Hamanaka on keyboards, and Jere Whiting on vocals and harmonica, but this larger configuration was later reduced to a power trio after seeing Jimi Hendrix at the Monterey Pop Festival, where The Who also performed a version of "Summertime Blues"—a song that would become pivotal to Blue Cheer's career.

The band's career took off with their 1968 debut album, *Vincebus Eruptum*, which featured their hit cover of Eddie Cochran's "Summertime Blues."  This single reached No. 14 on the Billboard Hot 100 and propelled the album to No. 11 on the Billboard 200.  The album also showcased original songs like "Out Of Focus" and "Doctor Please," along with blues covers by B.B. King and Mose Allison.  Subsequent personnel changes saw Leigh Stephens replaced by Randy Holden, and further shifts in guitarists (Bruce Stephens) and drummers (Mitch Mitchell, before Whaley's return) followed.  Kim Fowley produced an unreleased album in 1975, with Nick St. Nicholas co-producing; six tracks from these sessions were later released.  The band experienced periods of inactivity and reformation throughout the 1970s, 80s, and 90s, collaborating with various musicians and releasing albums like *The Beast Is Back* (1984) and *Highlights and Lowlives* (1990), the latter co-produced by Jack Endino.  The band continued to tour and record until Dickie Peterson's death in 2009.  A posthumous album, *What Doesn't Kill You...*, was released in 2007, featuring contributions from both Paul Whaley and Joe Hasselvander on drums.

Blue Cheer's musical style is characterized as psychedelic blues rock or acid rock, and they are considered pioneers of heavy metal, with their rendition of "Summertime Blues" often cited as one of the genre's earliest examples.  Their influence extends to punk rock, stoner rock, doom metal, experimental rock, and grunge.  The band was known for its incredibly loud performances, sometimes causing audience members to flee concerts due to the sheer volume.  Their rebellious attitude and outspoken criticism of the Vietnam War and societal norms further contributed to their unique identity.  Despite a dispute over the band's name, Blue Cheer's legacy as a highly influential and groundbreaking act remains firmly established, with artists like Buzz Osborne and Mark Arm citing their impact on the grunge movement.  Dickie Peterson's death in 2009 marked the end of Blue Cheer's active career, with guitarist Andrew MacDonald stating that the band would not continue. Paul Whaley, another key member, passed away in 2019.
