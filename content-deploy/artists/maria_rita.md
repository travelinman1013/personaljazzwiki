## Biography
Maria Rita (born Maria Rita Camargo Mariano in 1977 in São Paulo, Brazil) is a prominent Brazilian singer rooted in Música Popular Brasileira (MPB), samba and bossa nova.[2][4] She is the daughter of two major figures in Brazilian music—pianist and arranger César Camargo Mariano and legendary singer Elis Regina—and grew up in a deeply musical household alongside her brothers Pedro Mariano and João Marcelo Bôscoli.[2][6] Despite this heritage, she initially kept a low profile artistically, moving to the United States to study Latin American studies and communications at New York University and working as a journalist for a teen magazine before deciding to pursue a professional singing career in her mid‑20s.[2][7]

Rita began singing professionally at 24 and released her self‑titled debut album *Maria Rita* in 2003, immediately establishing herself as a major new voice in MPB.[2][3] The album’s opening track, “A Festa,” written by Milton Nascimento—whose own career had been boosted decades earlier by Elis Regina—symbolically linked Rita’s trajectory to her mother’s legacy while showcasing her own jazz‑inflected phrasing and rhythmic freedom.[2][3] The record went platinum, generated international tours, and earned her three Latin Grammy Awards in 2004, including Best New Artist and Best MPB Album.[2] Subsequent releases such as *Segundo* (2005), *Samba Meu* (2007), *Elo* (2011), *Redescobrir – Ao Vivo* (2012), *Coração a Batucar* (2014), and *Amor e Música* (2018) consolidated her reputation, with multiple additional Latin Grammys in MPB and samba/pagode categories and performances at major festivals like Montreux and North Sea Jazz.[2][3]

Vocally, Maria Rita is known for a warm, agile timbre and a highly expressive, jazz‑tinged approach that draws on scat, rubato, and subtle dynamic shading, often compared to Ella Fitzgerald in terms of technique and improvisational feel.[2][3] For many years she avoided directly covering her mother’s repertoire, building an identity through contemporary MPB and samba compositions and collaborations with leading songwriters before finally dedicating the 2012–2013 *Redescobrir* project to Elis Regina’s songs, reinterpreting them for a new generation.[2][3] By bridging classic MPB traditions with modern arrangements and a cosmopolitan, jazz‑aware vocal style, she has become a key figure in 21st‑century Brazilian music, extending the legacy of one of Brazil’s most revered musical families while firmly asserting her own artistic voice.[2][3][4]

## Fun Facts
- Maria Rita’s given namesake is Brazilian rock icon Rita Lee, a close family friend, so she literally carries the name of one of Brazil’s most famous rockers.[2][9]
- Although she grew up surrounded by music royalty, Rita initially avoided the spotlight, choosing to study at New York University and work as a journalist at a teen magazine before committing to singing professionally at age 24.[2][7][8]
- For many years she refused to perform her mother Elis Regina’s signature songs in public, only agreeing around 2012–2013 to record and tour the *Redescobrir* project dedicated to Elis’s repertoire.[2][3]
- Her second album *Segundo* not only expanded her international touring schedule but also earned her additional Latin Grammys and high‑profile slots at festivals like Montreux Jazz Festival and North Sea Jazz Festival, helping position Brazilian MPB and samba on major global jazz stages.[2][3]

## Musical Connections

### Mentors/Influences
- [[elis_regina|Elis Regina]] - Mother and towering stylistic reference; Rita inherited and reworked Elis’s intensely emotional, interpretive approach to MPB and samba, later dedicating the *Redescobrir* project to her repertoire. (Live album/DVD *Redescobrir – Ao Vivo* featuring songs associated with Elis Regina.) [Indirect influence throughout life; explicit homage around 2012–2013.[2][3]]
- [[césar_camargo_mariano|César Camargo Mariano]] - Father, pianist and arranger; provided early musical environment and model of professional musicianship and sophisticated harmony. (No widely cited joint recordings, but his arrangements and career strongly shaped her musical upbringing.) [Lifelong familial and musical influence.[2][6]]
- [[ella_fitzgerald|Ella Fitzgerald]] - Model for Rita’s jazzy vocal style; she has cited Fitzgerald as a reference for phrasing and improvisation. (General stylistic inspiration rather than specific shared projects.) [Cited as a key influence in discussions of her debut and subsequent work from the early 2000s onward.[2]]
- [[milton_nascimento|Milton Nascimento]] - Seminal MPB singer‑songwriter whose work connects generations of Brazilian music; his composition “A Festa” launched her debut and symbolically tied her to her mother’s generation. (Song “A Festa,” opening track of *Maria Rita* (2003).) [Artistic influence culminating in the 2003 debut collaboration.[2][3]]

### Key Collaborators
- [[milton_nascimento|Milton Nascimento]] - Provided the song that opened her debut album, strengthening her link to classic MPB and broadening her audience. (Composer of “A Festa” on the album *Maria Rita*.) [From the release of *Maria Rita* in 2003.[2][3]]
- [[rodrigo_maranhão|Rodrigo Maranhão]] - Songwriter whose work became central to her second album and earned them a Latin Grammy. (Song “Caminho das Águas” on *Segundo*, which won Latin Grammy for Best Brazilian Song.) [Mid‑2000s, especially around the 2005 release of *Segundo* and the 2006 Latin Grammys.[2]]
- [[calle_13|Calle 13]] - Rita appeared as a featured vocalist on their track “Latinoamérica,” which won Record of the Year at the Latin Grammys. (“Latinoamérica” (as a featured artist).) [Circa 2011 Latin Grammy cycle.[2]]
- [[chico_buarque|Chico Buarque]] - She recorded an acclaimed version of his song “A História de Lilly Braun,” showcasing her narrative and dramatic interpretive skills. (Performance of “A História de Lilly Braun” on the album *Elo*.) [Around the release of *Elo* (2011). [3]]

### Artists Influenced
- [[younger_mpb_and_samba_vocalists_general_cohort|Younger MPB and samba vocalists (general cohort)]] - Critics describe Rita as a bridge between classic MPB lineage (via Elis Regina and Milton Nascimento) and contemporary jazz‑inflected samba, making her a key reference point for newer Brazilian singers in these styles; specific named disciples are not well documented in available sources. (Influence is most often associated with her early albums *Maria Rita*, *Segundo*, and *Samba Meu*, and the reinterpretations on *Redescobrir*.) [From the mid‑2000s onward as her Latin Grammy‑winning albums circulated internationally.[2][3][4]]
