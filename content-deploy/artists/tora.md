## Biography
Tora Tora is an American glam metal and hard rock band formed in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1985 by vocalist Anthony Corder, guitarist Keith Douglas, bassist Patrick Francis, and drummer John Patterson. Starting as a local garage band, they won a Battle of the Bands contest, earning free studio time to record their independent EP *To Rock to Roll* (1987), which gained local radio airplay for tracks like 'Phantom Rider' and 'Love's A Bitch'. Signing with A&M Records, they released their debut album *Surprise Attack* (1989), which peaked at No. 47 on the Billboard 200, featuring singles 'Walkin' Shoes' (No. 86 on Hot 100) and 'Guilty', with 'Dancing With a Gypsy' appearing on the *Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure* soundtrack. They were the first Memphis band to have an MTV music video with 'Walkin' Shoes'.[1][2]

Their 1992 follow-up *Wild America* reached No. 132 on Billboard but sold fewer copies amid shifting musical tastes, marking a more mature songwriting evolution. A third album, *Revolution Day* (recorded 1994), was shelved due to label issues, leading to the band's breakup. Despite lacking major label support, Tora Tora built a cult following in the glam metal scene. The original lineup reunited in 2008 for anniversary shows, releasing *The Warehouse… 20 Years Later*, and signed with FNA Records, issuing archival albums like *Before & After* (2009), *Bombs Away* (2009), *Miss B. Haven'* (2010), and finally *Revolution Day* in 2011.[1][2]

Since then, Tora Tora has remained active, releasing *Bastards of Beale* (2019) to strong reviews and the compilation *Best of the Rest* (2024) with recent singles and outtakes. They continue touring, embodying Memphis hard rock resilience with their high-energy glam metal style influenced by the 1980s scene.[1][2]
