## Biography
Johnny Cash was born J.R. Cash on February 26, 1932, in Kingsland, Arkansas, to a family of poor Southern Baptist sharecroppers. His early years were shaped by the hardships of the Great Depression, working alongside his family in the cotton fields of Dyess, Arkansas, a New Deal farming colony. Music was a central part of Cash’s upbringing, with gospel hymns and folk songs sung by his mother and siblings providing comfort and inspiration. By age 12, Cash was writing his own songs, and his natural singing style was so distinctive that a vocal teacher advised him never to alter it.

After graduating high school in 1950, Cash enlisted in the United States Air Force, serving in Germany, where he bought his first guitar and formed a band called the Barbarians. Upon returning to the U.S., he moved to Memphis and began pursuing a music career in earnest, auditioning at Sun Studio and recording his first singles. Cash’s sound blended country, gospel, blues, and early rock and roll, earning him the nickname 'The Man in Black' for his somber stage attire and persona. His breakthrough came with hits like 'Cry! Cry! Cry!' and 'I Walk the Line,' followed by a long career marked by both critical acclaim and personal struggles, including substance abuse and recovery. His marriage to June Carter and the success of 'Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison' revitalized his career, and in later years, Cash collaborated with artists across genres, notably with the Highwaymen and producer Rick Rubin.

Cash’s legacy is profound: his deep, resonant voice and storytelling lyrics gave voice to the marginalized and working class, and his music bridged country, rock, and folk traditions. Revered for his authenticity and empathy, Cash remains an icon whose influence endures in American music and culture.
