## Biography
Sam Morgan's Jazz Band was a seminal New Orleans jazz ensemble led by Sam Morgan, born December 18, 1887, in Bertrandville, Louisiana. Morgan grew up immersed in the vibrant brass band tradition of Plaquemines Parish, eventually taking up the cornet like his brother Ike and many other local musicians. By the 1920s, Sam Morgan had established his own group, which became known as the "Young Morgan Band" and was one of the most popular territory bands touring the Gulf Coast circuit, performing from Galveston, Texas to Pensacola, Florida.[1][6]

The band's musical style was rooted in early jazz and ragtime, characterized by lively ensemble playing, strong rhythmic drive, and a repertoire that blended original compositions with traditional tunes. In 1927, Sam Morgan's Jazz Band recorded eight influential sides for Columbia Records in New Orleans, including "Steppin' on the Gas," "Mobile Stomp," and "Bogalusa Strut." These recordings are considered classics of New Orleans jazz and represent the entirety of the band's recorded legacy.[1][2][3]

Sam Morgan's Jazz Band left a lasting legacy, influencing generations of jazz musicians and ensembles. Their recordings have been reissued and studied extensively, and their music continues to be performed by groups such as the Louisiana Repertory Jazz Ensemble. Sam Morgan passed away in New Orleans on February 25, 1936, but his band's contributions remain a touchstone for traditional jazz enthusiasts.[1][5]
