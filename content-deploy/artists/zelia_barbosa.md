## Biography
Zelia Barbosa was a Brazilian singer known for her evocative performances and her commitment to social themes, particularly those highlighting the struggles of Brazil’s working class. Emerging in the 1960s, Barbosa became most recognized for her 1968 album 'Brazil: Songs of Protest,' released on Monitor Records, which featured songs addressing the hardships of plantation workers, social injustice, and the resilience of everyday people. Her vocal style was marked by expressive phrasing and a somber, defiant tone that brought depth to the protest songs she interpreted.

Barbosa’s music drew from the traditions of Brazilian folk and protest music, blending simple yet powerful instrumentation—often guitar, bass, and percussion—with lyrics that resonated with the political climate of her era.

Although her discography appears limited, her work remains a testament to the power of music as a form of resistance and social commentary.
