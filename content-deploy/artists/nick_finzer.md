## Biography
Nick Finzer is an American jazz trombonist, composer, bandleader, educator, and label founder, widely regarded as one of the leading trombone voices of his generation.[2][3][7] Born and raised in Rochester, New York, in a musical family as the son of internationally known flutist Sherry Finzer, he was drawn early to the sound of Duke Ellington and the big-band tradition.[5][6] His involvement with the Eastman School of Music’s pre-college program and Jazz at Lincoln Center’s Essentially Ellington competition cemented his decision to pursue a life in music, eventually leading him to formal studies at the Eastman School of Music and a master’s degree from the Juilliard School’s prestigious jazz program, where he was mentored by trombone legend Steve Turre.[3][5] As a young musician he also developed a formative mentorship with master trombonist Wycliffe Gordon, who wrote original pieces for Finzer and helped guide his early career.[3][5]

Emerging in the 2010s, Finzer quickly established himself in New York City as both a bandleader and in-demand sideman, working with ensembles such as Wynton Marsalis’ Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra, Lucas Pino’s No Net Nonet, Ryan Truesdell’s Gil Evans Project, Bob Stewart’s Double Quartet, and the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra.[2][3][5] He released his debut album as a leader, “Exposition,” in 2013, followed by a string of critically acclaimed recordings that showcased his dynamic writing and modern yet historically grounded approach to jazz, including projects with his long-standing sextet Hear & Now and his quartet.[1][3] His compositions have earned two ASCAP Young Jazz Composer Awards, and he received a Chamber Music America New Jazz Works grant in 2020 for the project that culminated in the 2023 album “Dreams, Visions, and Illusions.”[1][2] In addition to his work as a performer and composer, Finzer became the inaugural Professor of Jazz Trombone at the University of North Texas in 2018, underscoring his growing impact as an educator and mentor to emerging trombonists.[2]

Stylistically, Finzer combines a deep command of bebop and post-bop language with contemporary harmonic and rhythmic ideas, often drawing on narrative and conceptual themes in his albums.[2][3] His bold, focused trombone sound and tightly crafted arrangements reflect the influence of J.J. Johnson and the Ellington/Strayhorn legacy while embracing the sonic possibilities of 21st‑century jazz.[1][3][4] This connection is most explicit in his 2024 album “Legacy,” recorded at Rudy Van Gelder Studio with Johnson’s longtime collaborators Renee Rosnes, Rufus Reid, and Lewis Nash, which pays tribute not only to Johnson’s trombone virtuosity but also to his work as a composer and arranger.[1][2][4] As a label founder and entrepreneur aligned with the Outside in Music collective, Finzer has also contributed to building platforms for other modern jazz artists, further extending his influence on today’s jazz landscape.[1][3] His ongoing projects—including his sextet Hear & Now, the Nick Finzer Quartet, his big band, and the Brass Orchestra collaboration celebrating J.J. Johnson—position him as a central figure in shaping the future of jazz trombone.[1][4]
