## Biography
Los Indios Tabajaras were a renowned Brazilian guitar duo consisting of brothers Antenor Lima and Natalicio (Nato) Lima, hailing from Tianguá, Ceará, in the northeast of Brazil. The duo took their name from the Tabajara, an indigenous people of the region, and their early life is steeped in legend: it is widely recounted that they discovered a guitar by chance in the forest, which sparked their fascination with music. Raised in a remote indigenous community, the brothers eventually left their tribe in the 1930s, traveling nearly 2,000 kilometers to Rio de Janeiro, where they began to immerse themselves in the world of music and performance.[1][2]

Initially performing as Natalicio and Antenor Lima, the brothers gained attention by playing classical guitars and transcribing works from violin and piano repertoires, blending European classical influences with Latin American and indigenous folk melodies. Their career took off in the 1940s and 1950s, with notable success across South America. After a period of formal study in classical guitar, they reemerged as Los Indios Tabajaras, achieving international fame with their 1958 recording of "María Elena," which became a global hit after its U.S. release in 1963, selling over a million copies and earning a gold disc. Their fluid, lyrical style and unique stage presence—often performing in ceremonial costumes—made them popular worldwide, and they continued to tour extensively through the Americas and Europe.[1][3]

Los Indios Tabajaras are celebrated for their virtuosic technique, elegant arrangements, and the way they bridged indigenous Brazilian identity with global popular and classical music. Their legacy endures as pioneers who brought Latin American guitar music to international audiences, influencing generations of musicians with their artistry and cross-cultural appeal.[1][4]
