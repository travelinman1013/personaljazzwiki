## Biography
Calexico is an American indie rock band formed in Tucson, Arizona in 1996 by guitarist/singer Joey Burns and drummer John Convertino, who first met in 1990 when Burns was a music student at the University of California, Irvine and Convertino was drumming for Howe Gelb’s band Giant Sand.[1][3][6] Burns initially joined Giant Sand on upright bass for a European tour and later moved to the band’s Tucson base, where his partnership with Convertino deepened through work in Giant Sand and the instrumental combo Friends of Dean Martinez, helping shape the desert‑noir textures they would later refine in Calexico.[1][3][4] Their debut, originally released in Europe in 1996 under the name Spoke and then in the U.S. in 1997 as Calexico after a name change, introduced a sound steeped in the landscapes and cultures of the U.S.–Mexico border, reflected even in their new band name, taken from the border town of Calexico, California.[3][4][5]

From the late 1990s through the 2000s, Calexico developed from a studio‑driven duo into a full band with a fluid, multinational lineup, adding instruments such as violins, horns, steel guitar, marimba, and vibraphone that expanded their arrangements and cinematic scope.[1][4][5] Albums like *The Black Light* (1998), a concept record about life in the Arizona and northern Mexico desert, and *Feast of Wire* (2003), which earned extensive critical praise and their first significant Billboard chart presence, established them as leading voices in a border‑blurring strain of Americana that fuses alt‑country, indie rock, jazz, and Latin genres.[2][3][4] Their 2005 collaboration EP *In the Reins* with Iron & Wine also charted on the Billboard 200 and helped broaden their audience.[3] Over time, Burns and Convertino have kept Calexico’s core identity while collaborating with a rotating cast of musicians and taking on side roles as an in‑demand rhythm section, producers, and film scorers, leading to high‑profile festival appearances (Bonnaroo, Lollapalooza, Glastonbury, Roskilde) and tours with bands such as Wilco, Pavement, Arcade Fire, and Andrew Bird.[1][2]

Musically, Calexico are noted for their distinctive blend of traditional Latin styles—mariachi, conjunto, cumbia, tejano—with country, folk, jazz, and post‑rock, often described as “desert noir” or “cowboy lounge” for its moody, filmic atmosphere and evocations of the borderlands.[2][3][4][8] Critics have highlighted the band’s ability to move between quiet, intricate arrangements and loud, guitar‑driven passages; NPR praised their “sprawling, cross‑cultural indie rock,” while WNYC remarked on their capacity to “roar like Sonic Youth [and] whisper like Elliott Smith” in concert.[2] Their tenth studio album, *El Mirador* (2022), continued their long‑running exploration of the American Southwest’s cultural crossroads, reinforcing their legacy as influential architects of a hybrid Americana that foregrounds cross‑border exchange, migration, and the textures of the Sonoran desert.[2][7][9]

## Fun Facts
- Calexico’s name was originally Spoke; the duo released their first album under that name in Europe in 1996, but changed it to Calexico for the U.S. release because another band was already using Spoke, choosing ‘Calexico’ after the California–Mexico border town to reflect their growing Latin influences.[3][4][5]
- When their first full‑length *The Black Light* came out in 1998, Calexico were still essentially a two‑piece, yet their live sound was noted for being surprisingly dense and electrified, with Joey Burns’ guitar and effects filling both rhythm and bass roles well before the duo format became fashionable with bands like The White Stripes and The Black Keys.[4]
- Calexico’s reputation as a live band grew early on thanks to opening slots for acts like Lambchop, Pavement, and the Dirty Three, which helped introduce their border‑inspired sound to indie‑rock audiences across Europe and North America.[1]
- Beyond their own albums, Burns and Convertino have worked as a kind of ‘rhythm section du jour,’ backing artists such as Barbara Manning, Bill Janovitz, Michael Hurley, and Richard Buckner on tours and recordings while simultaneously developing Calexico.[4]

## Musical Connections

### Mentors/Influences
- [[howe_gelb|Howe Gelb]] - Band leader of Giant Sand who employed both Joey Burns and John Convertino; his experimental, ever‑evolving approach to songwriting and band lineups provided a model for Burns and Convertino’s own fluid, exploratory work in Calexico. (Giant Sand tours and recordings in the early–mid 1990s, including Burns joining on upright bass for a European tour before Calexico formally formed.) [circa 1990–mid 1990s]
- [[friends_of_dean_martinez_via_bill_elm_and_ensemble|Friends of Dean Martinez (via Bill Elm and ensemble)]] - Instrumental project that Burns and Convertino played in before focusing full‑time on Calexico; its mix of jazz, Ennio Morricone‑style spaghetti‑western sounds, and ‘cowboy lounge’ ambience shaped Calexico’s desert‑noir aesthetic. (Early Friends of Dean Martinez recordings released by Sub Pop, where Burns and Convertino contributed guitar, drums, marimba, and other textures.) [mid 1990s]
- [[traditional_latin_and_border_music_mariachi_conjunto_cumbia_tejano|Traditional Latin and border music (mariachi, conjunto, cumbia, tejano)]] - Stylistic and cultural influences drawn from the Mexican‑American border region around Tucson and the town of Calexico; these genres inform the band’s rhythmic patterns, horn arrangements, and melodic language. (Albums such as *The Black Light*, *Feast of Wire*, and *El Mirador*, which prominently feature mariachi‑style horns, cumbia and tejano rhythms, and conjunto‑inspired accordion and guitar textures.) [1996–present]

### Key Collaborators
- [[iron_and_wine_sam_beam|Iron & Wine (Sam Beam)]] - Collaborative partner on a joint EP that blended Beam’s intimate folk songwriting with Calexico’s border‑inflected arrangements; the project significantly raised Calexico’s profile. (EP *In the Reins* (2005), which reached the Billboard 200 albums chart.) [mid 2000s]
- [[amos_lee|Amos Lee]] - Calexico (particularly Burns and Convertino) worked as producers and performers on Lee’s album *Mission Bell*, contributing their atmospheric, Southwestern‑tinged instrumentation. (Album *Mission Bell*, which reached #1 on the Billboard charts.) [early 2010s (album released 2011)]
- [[wilco|Wilco]] - Touring partners; Calexico joined Wilco on the road, exposing both bands’ audiences to each other’s takes on Americana and indie rock. (Shared tour dates and festival appearances, with Calexico performing as an opening or co‑bill act.) [2000s (exact years not consistently specified)]
- [[pavement|Pavement]] - Early touring peers; Calexico’s reputation as a live act grew in part from opening for Pavement, connecting them to the 1990s indie‑rock circuit. (Support slots on Pavement tours, especially around the time of Calexico’s early albums.) [late 1990s–early 2000s]
- [[arcade_fire|Arcade Fire]] - High‑profile live collaborators in the sense of touring together; this placed Calexico alongside major indie‑rock acts on festival stages and larger venues. (Shared festival and tour appearances noted in band biographies.) [2000s–2010s (specific dates not consistently documented)]
- [[andrew_bird|Andrew Bird]] - Touring collaborator; Calexico shared bills with Bird, whose violin‑driven indie folk intersects with Calexico’s orchestrated, genre‑blending approach. (Joint live shows and festival sets.) [2000s–2010s]
- [[jacob_valenzuela|Jacob Valenzuela]] - Long‑standing touring and recording member contributing trumpet, keyboards, and vocals, central to the band’s mariachi‑ and cumbia‑inflected sound. (Live shows and albums from the 2000s onward, including contributions to records like *Feast of Wire* and later releases.) [2000s–present]
- [[martin_wenk|Martin Wenk]] - German multi‑instrumentalist (trumpet, accordions, guitars, more) who became a key part of the expanded Calexico lineup, especially on tour. (Touring band work and studio contributions on multiple albums during the 2000s.) [early 2000s–2010s]
- [[volker_zander|Volker Zander]] - German bassist who joined the multinational touring incarnation of Calexico, reinforcing the rhythm section around Burns and Convertino. (Live performances and selected recordings during the band’s expansion beyond its original duo format.) [2000s]
- [[paul_niehaus|Paul Niehaus]] - Pedal steel guitarist from Lambchop who augmented Calexico’s touring lineup, adding characteristic country and ambient steel textures. (Touring band performances and likely contributions to live arrangements during the mid‑2000s.) [mid 2000s]

### Artists Influenced
- [[later_americana_and_indie_bands_blending_latin_and_southwestern_sounds_e.g._desert_noir_and_bordermusic_scenes|Later Americana and indie bands blending Latin and Southwestern sounds (e.g., ‘desert noir’ and border‑music scenes)]] - Calexico are frequently cited in criticism and features as pioneers of a cross‑cultural, border‑conscious form of indie Americana, influencing subsequent artists who mix mariachi or cumbia with rock and folk; however, individual follower bands are rarely named explicitly in major reference biographies, so this influence is best described at the scene level rather than via specific protégés. (The band’s early albums like *The Black Light* and *Feast of Wire*, plus later records such as *El Mirador*, serve as reference points for writers and musicians discussing ‘desert noir’ and Southwestern fusion styles.) [2000s–present]
