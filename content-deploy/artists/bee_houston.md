## Biography
Edward Wilson "Bee" Houston was born on April 19, 1938, in San Antonio, Texas. Largely self-taught, he began playing guitar in his teens, drawing inspiration from the vibrant Texas blues scene and the gospel-infused sounds of the South. In 1961, Houston relocated to Los Angeles, California, where he immersed himself in the West Coast blues circuit, quickly gaining a reputation for his energetic performances and soulful guitar work.[1][7][8]

Houston's musical style was a dynamic blend of Texas shuffle blues and Southern gospel-tinged soul, characterized by his expressive guitar playing and powerful vocals. He became best known as the longtime guitarist for blues legend Big Mama Thornton during the later years of her career, both on stage and in the studio. As a bandleader, Houston also fronted his own group, Bee Houston & His High Steppers, and released the well-regarded album "The Hustler" on Arhoolie Records. Throughout the 1960s to 1980s, he was a fixture in the Los Angeles blues scene, performing with numerous notable musicians.[3][5][7]

Although not widely recognized outside blues circles, Bee Houston left a lasting impact through his passionate performances and collaborations. He passed away on March 19, 1991, in Los Angeles. His legacy endures among blues aficionados who appreciate his contributions to the genre's evolution and his role in supporting other legendary artists.[1][2][5]
