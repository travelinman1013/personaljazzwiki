## Biography
Ellen McIlwaine was born Frances Ellen McIlwaine on October 1, 1945, in Nashville, Tennessee, and was adopted as an infant by Southern Presbyterian missionary parents who relocated her to Kobe, Japan at age two. She spent her formative years in Japan, attending the Canadian Academy in Kobe and graduating in 1963, where she developed an early passion for music by listening to American blues and soul artists like Ray Charles, Fats Domino, and Professor Longhair on Japanese radio. Upon returning to the United States, she pursued art school in Atlanta, Georgia, where she began her stage career in the mid-1960s, initially playing acoustic guitar before eventually becoming renowned for her distinctive slide guitar technique.

McIlwaine's breakthrough came in 1966 when she moved to New York City's Greenwich Village, where she performed nightly at the Cafe Au Go Go, opening for and playing alongside legendary blues and rock musicians including Jimi Hendrix, Muddy Waters, Sonny Terry, Brownie McGhee, and Big Joe Williams. She returned to Atlanta to form Fear Itself, a psychedelic blues rock band, before launching a solo career that produced two critically acclaimed albums for Polydor Records: "Honky Tonk Angel" (1972) and "We the People" (1973), the latter featuring the hit single "I Don't Want to Play." Her musical style defied easy categorization, blending blues, folk, soul, and rock influences, and she became particularly known for her acoustic and electric slide guitar interpretations of songs by artists such as Stevie Wonder and Jimi Hendrix.

After relocating to Canada in 1987, where she became a permanent resident, McIlwaine continued to perform extensively on the blues and folk festival circuit while also working as a school bus driver in Calgary, Alberta. She founded her own record label, Ellen McIlwaine Music, in 2006 and released "Mystic Bridge," a fusion project featuring Indian tabla drummer Cassius Khan that showcased her willingness to explore cross-cultural musical collaboration. Throughout her career, she toured with notable artists including Patty Larkin and Sue Foley, appeared in the 2013 Jimi Hendrix documentary "Hear My Train A Comin," and received the Toronto Blues Society's "Blues with a Feeling" Lifetime Achievement Award in 2019. She passed away on June 23, 2021, in Calgary, Alberta, at age 75, leaving behind a legacy as a pioneering female slide guitarist who refused to conform to industry expectations.
