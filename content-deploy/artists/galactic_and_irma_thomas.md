## Biography
Galactic, a cornerstone of New Orleans’ vibrant music scene since the 1990s, is known for their energetic blend of funk, jazz, rock, brass band, and world music. Formed in 1994, the band quickly became a staple of the city’s late-night circuit, celebrated for their genre-bending sound and relentless live performances. Over the years, Galactic has consistently pushed the boundaries of funk, collaborating with a wide range of artists and earning a reputation as ambassadors of modern New Orleans music.

Irma Thomas, born in 1941 in New Orleans, is revered as the 'Soul Queen of New Orleans.' She began her career as a teenager, scoring her first hit in 1959 with 'Don’t Mess with My Man.' Throughout the 1960s, Thomas recorded a string of R&B classics, including 'It’s Raining,' 'Wish Someone Would Care,' and her influential rendition of 'Time Is On My Side,' which inspired The Rolling Stones’ first American Top 10 single. Thomas’s career has spanned over six decades, marked by her powerful, emotive voice and her ability to move seamlessly across gospel, soul, blues, and funk. She won her first Grammy Award in 2007 for her album 'After the Rain,' a poignant reflection on Hurricane Katrina’s aftermath.

The collaboration between Galactic and Irma Thomas, culminating in the 2024 album 'Audience With the Queen,' is a celebration of New Orleans’ musical legacy. The project features original songs written by Galactic with lyrics tailored for Thomas, showcasing her commanding vocals and storytelling prowess. The album stands as a testament to the enduring influence of both Galactic’s innovative funk and Thomas’s soulful artistry, bridging generations and genres in a uniquely New Orleans fashion.
