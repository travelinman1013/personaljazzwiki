## Biography
Marlena Shaw (born Marlina Burgess on September 22, 1942, in New Rochelle, New York; died January 19, 2024) was an American jazz, blues, and soul singer celebrated for her versatility and charismatic stage presence[1][2][4]. Raised in a musical family, Shaw’s earliest influences were her uncle Jimmy Burgess, a jazz trumpet player, and her grandmother, both of whom introduced her to gospel and jazz music. At age ten, she performed at Harlem’s Apollo Theater, a formative experience that set her on the path to a lifelong career in music[1][2][3][4]. Although she briefly attended the State Teachers’ College in Potsdam, New York, she left to pursue singing, performing in New England clubs and with jazz trumpeter Howard McGhee’s trio in the early 1960s[2][3][4].

Shaw’s professional breakthrough came in the mid-1960s when she was discovered by Chess Records while singing at Playboy Clubs. Under the Cadet subsidiary, she recorded vocal versions of jazz hits such as "Mercy Mercy Mercy" and "Wade In The Water," and released two albums before moving on in 1968[2][3][4]. Her 1969 recording of "California Soul," written by Ashford & Simpson, became a staple of the UK rare groove scene and was widely sampled in hip hop and used in commercials[4]. She joined the Count Basie Orchestra as a vocalist for four years, further honing her jazz credentials[3][5]. Shaw’s career spanned several decades and labels, including Blue Note, Columbia, Verve, and Concord Jazz, with notable albums such as "Out of Different Bags," "Spice of Life," and "Who Is This Bitch, Anyway?"[5].

Marlena Shaw’s musical style blended jazz, soul, blues, pop, R&B, and disco, marked by her expressive phrasing, improvisational skill, and dynamic live performances[2][3][5]. Her legacy endures through her influence on generations of vocalists, her enduring recordings, and the continued sampling of her work in contemporary music. Shaw remained a fixture on the international jazz scene, performing for audiences worldwide and inspiring new listeners through compilations and reissues[5].
