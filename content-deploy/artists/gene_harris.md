## Biography
Gene Harris (born Eugene Haire, September 1, 1933 – January 16, 2000) was an American jazz pianist born in Benton Harbor, Michigan, who became one of the most accessible and influential figures in soul jazz. Harris first encountered music at age four through local bandleader Charles Metcalf's group and church music, and began teaching himself piano at age nine, drawing inspiration from Oscar Peterson's playing style and the boogie-woogie records of Meade Lux Lewis and Albert Ammons. After serving in the Army from 1951 to 1954, where he played in military bands, Harris formed The Four Sounds in 1954, which evolved into the groundbreaking Three Sounds trio by 1956 with bassist Andy Simpkins and drummer Bill Dowdy—a group that would become widely regarded as one of the progenitors of the soul jazz genre.

From 1956 to 1973, Harris achieved prominence as the pianist of The Three Sounds, recording extensively for Blue Note and Verve Records while supporting legendary artists including Lester Young, Nat Adderley, Stanley Turrentine, Sonny Stitt, and Anita O'Day. Harris's distinctive style combined blues, gospel, and swing influences with technical precision and innovative chord substitutions, earning him recognition as a master of the 12-bar blues form in jazz. After The Three Sounds disbanded in 1973, Harris pursued a solo career, eventually relocating to Boise, Idaho in 1977 for semi-retirement, where he performed regularly at the Idanha Hotel and mentored local musicians including Curtis Stigers.

Harris's career experienced a resurgence in the 1980s following a critically acclaimed appearance on vibraphonist Milt Jackson's 1983 album Soul Routes, leading to collaborations with bassist Ray Brown and his association with Concord Records. Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, he led the Gene Harris Quartet and served as bandleader for the Philip Morris Superband, which toured internationally with headlining acts including Ray Charles and B.B. King. In 1988, Harris received a Grammy nomination for his album Tribute to Count Basie in the best big band instrumental category. His legacy extended beyond performance through the establishment of the Gene Harris Endowment Fund in 1996 and the inaugural Gene Harris Jazz Festival in 1998, both based in Boise and dedicated to supporting jazz education and scholarships at Boise State University. Harris passed away on January 16, 2000, at age 66 while awaiting a liver transplant from his daughter.

## Fun Facts
- Harris originally formed The Four Sounds in 1954 with a tenor saxophonist named Lonnie 'The Sound' Walker, but the group became The Three Sounds after Walker left within the first year due to the rigors of touring and other complications.
- Harris described himself as a 'blues pianist with chops,' and pianist Eric Reed once characterized him simply as 'Gene Harris = Power,' reflecting his commanding presence at the keyboard.
- Harris relocated to Boise, Idaho in 1977 for 'semi-retirement' but his popular performances at the Idanha Hotel led to a career resurgence that resulted in international touring with major artists and the establishment of the Gene Harris Jazz Festival.
- Harris married Jane Marie 'Janie' Hewitt on April 21, 1985, and she became instrumental in managing his quartet and superband while co-authoring his biography with Bob Evancho.
