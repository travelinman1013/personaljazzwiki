## Biography
Roy 'Chubby' Carrier Jr. was born on July 1, 1967, in Church Point, Louisiana, into a legendary zydeco family that shaped his musical destiny from childhood. His father Roy Carrier Sr. and grandfather Warren Carrier were established zydeco musicians, and young Chubby was immersed in the genre through family gatherings and band practices. At just 10 years old, he made his first public performance as a drummer with The Carrier Brothers at an American Legion Hall in Church Point, playing without prior rehearsal or experience. He continued performing on weekends throughout middle and high school, developing his skills as a percussionist while absorbing the rich musical traditions of Louisiana's zydeco culture.

At age 17, Chubby received a life-changing opportunity when Terrance Simien invited him to join The Mallet Playboys, recognizing his reputation as one of the best drummers in zydeco. For approximately 2.5 years, Carrier toured internationally with Simien's band, opening 14 shows for legendary R&B musician Fats Domino and performing across North Africa, Europe, and beyond. This global exposure fueled his ambition to spread zydeco music worldwide. In 1989, with Simien's blessing, Carrier formed Chubby Carrier and the Bayou Swamp Band with his brothers Troy and Kevin. The band achieved significant success with their 1993 album 'Dance All Night,' which won broad cross-genre acclaim, and their 2010 release 'Zydeco Junkie' earned a Grammy Award for Best Zydeco or Cajun Music. Performing up to 275 days annually, Carrier established himself as 'The World's Premier Zydeco Showman,' touring extensively throughout the United States, Canada, and Europe while founding his own record label, Swampadelic Records, in 2000 to promote zydeco music through innovative internet marketing strategies.

## Fun Facts
- Chubby made his first zydeco performance at age 10 without any prior rehearsal or experience, playing drums at an American Legion Hall in Church Point after being pulled directly from a football game in his front yard by his father who needed a drummer for a gig.
- At age 17, Chubby toured North Africa (Morocco, Egypt, Algeria, and Sudan) with Terrance Simien for the U.S. State Department, an experience he described as 'the most amazing time that I have ever, ever, ever witnessed,' never imagining he would play zydeco music in North Africa.
- Chubby Carrier and the Bayou Swamp Band performed approximately 275 days per year during their peak touring years, establishing an international presence before even being signed to a major record label.
- In 2000, Chubby founded his own record label, Swampadelic Records, combining his knowledge of zydeco music with internet marketing strategies to promote Louisiana's musical heritage globally.
