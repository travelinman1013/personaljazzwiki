## Biography
The Swiss Movement was a short-lived American vocal soul group active in the early 1970s. Originating in New Orleans before relocating to Detroit, the group consisted of Arthur Booker, Herbert Clifton, Ronald Williams, and John Hodges. They are best known for their 1972 album 'It's Time for Us' released on RCA, as well as a handful of singles issued between 1971 and 1974. Their sound blended elements of soul, R&B, and vocal harmony, reflecting the musical currents of their era.

Despite a limited discography, The Swiss Movement made a modest impact in soul music circles, particularly among collectors and aficionados of rare groove and Northern Soul. Their music is characterized by tight vocal arrangements, emotive delivery, and a polished yet heartfelt production style. Although they never achieved mainstream success or charted widely, their recordings have been rediscovered by soul enthusiasts and remain appreciated for their authentic early-70s soul sound.

The group's legacy is largely preserved through reissues and online sharing among collectors. While not widely influential in the broader music industry, The Swiss Movement's work stands as a testament to the vibrant but often overlooked soul scene of their time, and their recordings continue to be sought after by those interested in the deeper cuts of American soul music.
