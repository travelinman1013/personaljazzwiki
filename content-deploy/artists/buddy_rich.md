## Biography
Buddy Rich, born Bernard Rich on September 30, 1917, in Brooklyn, New York, was a prodigious drumming talent whose career began in infancy. Raised in a vaudeville family, he was performing on stage by 18 months and, as 'Traps the Drum Wonder,' became one of the highest-paid child entertainers by age four. By his early teens, Rich was leading his own band, and his natural sense of rhythm and speed set him apart even before he entered the jazz world.

Rich's professional jazz career took off in the late 1930s, first with Joe Marsala and then with major swing bands led by Tommy Dorsey, Harry James, and Artie Shaw. He became renowned for his technical brilliance, showmanship, and the sheer power and precision of his playing, often cited as the greatest jazz drummer of all time. In the 1960s, Rich formed his own big band, achieving lasting success and influencing the direction of modern big band jazz with innovative arrangements and a relentless drive for excellence. He continued performing and recording until his death in 1987, leaving behind a legacy of legendary recordings, including the celebrated 'West Side Story' medley, and a reputation for demanding perfection from his band members.

Rich's musical style was characterized by phenomenal speed, dexterity, and dynamic control, blending swing, bebop, and hard bop influences. He was a charismatic performer, frequently appearing on television and in films, and his impact on drumming and jazz remains profound, inspiring generations of musicians and setting a standard for technical mastery and expressive power.
