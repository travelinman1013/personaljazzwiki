## Biography
Led Zeppelin were an English rock band formed in London in 1968, emerging from the dissolution of the blues-rock band the Yardbirds. Guitarist Jimmy Page, the final lead guitarist of the Yardbirds, assembled the classic lineup by recruiting bassist-keyboardist John Paul Jones (whom he knew from session work), vocalist Robert Plant (recommended by Plant himself after Page discovered him fronting Band of Joy), and drummer John Bonham. The band performed their first concert as the New Yardbirds on September 7, 1968, in Gladsaxe, Denmark, before officially debuting as Led Zeppelin on October 25, 1968, at the University of Surrey in Guildford. They recorded their eponymous debut album in just nine days, which was released in 1969 and became an immediate commercial success despite critical dismissal, reaching the top ten in the United States and establishing their signature sound of heavy, guitar-driven blues-rock.

Led Zeppelin's musical style synthesized American blues with British folk, psychedelia, soul, reggae, and Celtic and Arabic influences, creating a powerful, stomping sound that proved highly influential. Their second album, Led Zeppelin II, recorded mostly on the road during their first North American tours, reached number one in both the US and UK charts and is often cited as the musical starting point for heavy metal. Over their ten-year career, the band released eight studio albums while maintaining unprecedented artistic control through their Atlantic Records contract, which granted them autonomy over release timing, album contents, promotion, and single selection. Led Zeppelin became one of the best-selling music artists of all time and are credited as progenitors of hard rock and heavy metal, fundamentally shaping the development of album-oriented rock and stadium rock. The band disbanded in 1980 following the accidental death of drummer John Bonham, though they reunited for brief performances in 1985 (Live Aid), 1988 (Atlantic Records' 40th anniversary), and 1995 (Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction).

## Fun Facts
- Led Zeppelin's name originated from a dark joke: members of The Who (Keith Moon and John Entwistle) had suggested that a supergroup with Jimmy Page and Jeff Beck would go down like a 'lead balloon'—an idiom for being unsuccessful—which the band cleverly adapted as their name.
- The band's debut album was recorded and mixed in just nine days, with Jimmy Page personally covering the recording costs.
- Led Zeppelin signed with Atlantic Records without the label executives ever having seen them perform live; they were signed at the recommendation of British singer Dusty Springfield, a friend of John Paul Jones.
- The band formed their own publishing company, Superhype, to handle all publishing rights, giving them unprecedented control over their music and business affairs in an era when such autonomy was rare.
