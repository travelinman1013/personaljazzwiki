# BLYTHE'S WASHBOARD BAND

## Biography
James Louis 'Jimmy' Blythe (May 20, 1901 – June 14, 1931) was born in Lexington, Kentucky, into the Blythe family, which faced changing circumstances by 1910, likely limiting formal education and piano training. He appears to have learned ragtime piano by observing performers rather than through structured lessons. In 1915, Blythe moved to Chicago, where he connected with Clarence M. Jones, a classically trained ragtime and blues pianist who influenced his style and helped him adapt to emerging jazz elements[1][7].

Blythe's career surged in 1922 when he began recording piano rolls for Columbia Music Roll Company, producing up to 300 rolls by 1924, incorporating octave bass, boogie patterns, blues riffs, and stride elements that gained popularity among musicians[1]. In 1924, he entered the recording studio for Paramount Records, releasing tracks like Armour Avenue Struggle and Chicago Stomp, often credited as among the earliest boogie-woogie recordings. He led ensembles including Blythe's Sinful Five, Jimmy Blythe and his Ragamuffins, **Blythe's Washboard Band**, Blythe's Washboard Ragamuffins, Blythe's Owls, State Street Ramblers, Dixie Four, and Midnight Rounders, accumulating around 500 recordings in nine years[1][2][4]. His style blended ragtime, blues, and early boogie-woogie, influencing Chicago's jazz scene.

Blythe died prematurely at age 30 from meningitis in Chicago in 1931, cutting short a prolific legacy as a pioneering pianist whose rolls and records shaped boogie-woogie and inspired emulation across the Midwest[1][4][6].

## Fun Facts
- Blythe's 1924 Paramount recordings, like Armour Avenue Struggle and Chicago Stomp, feature rolling boogie-woogie bass, positioning him as one of the earliest recorded boogie-woogie pianists, though debated semantically[1].
- He amassed approximately 500 recordings (solo, ensemble, and piano rolls) in just nine years, a rare feat for the era, rivaled by few African-American artists[1].
- Mecca Flat Blues, referencing a controversial Chicago apartment complex, became his biggest hit among performers and was published in a Paramount folio arranged by Aletha Dickerson[1].
- Blythe performed on Chicago radio station KYW in 1926-1927 with Alex J. Robinson, as noted in The Chicago Defender[1].
