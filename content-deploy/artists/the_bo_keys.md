## Biography
The Bo-Keys are a Memphis, Tennessee–based soul and soul-jazz band founded in 1998 by bassist, producer, and film composer Scott Bomar as an homage to the city’s classic Stax and Hi Records sound.[1][3][8] Bomar, who had previously led the instrumental combo Impala, formed the group after being asked to assemble a backing band for former Stax artist Sir Mack Rice, deciding to recreate and extend the 1960s Memphis instrumental and R&B tradition by recruiting many of the very musicians who had defined it in the first place.[1][2] Early lineups included trumpeter Mark Franklin and guitarist John Stivers, and the band’s core gradually expanded to feature veteran session players such as guitarist Charles “Skip” Pitts, drummer Howard Grimes, keyboardist Archie “Hubbie” Turner, trumpeter and vocalist Ben Cauley, and vocalist Percy Wiggins, all of whom brought direct ties to the original Stax, Hi, and Bar-Kays eras.[1][2][3][6]

In 2003 the Bo-Keys recorded their debut album *The Royal Sessions* at Willie Mitchell’s Royal Studio in Memphis, a project deeply rooted in the groove-driven, horn-laced Memphis soul sound that Mitchell had crafted for artists like Al Green and Ann Peebles.[1][2] Beyond their own albums—including *The Royal Sessions* (2004), *Got to Get Back!* (2011), and *Heartaches By the Number* (2016)—the group gained wider visibility by performing the score for the Academy Award–winning film *Hustle & Flow* and contributing the song “Kick It” to the animated feature *Barnyard*.[1][8] Stylistically, the Bo-Keys blend classic Southern soul, R&B, and soul-jazz with a modern sensibility, emphasizing tight horn arrangements, earthy rhythm-section grooves, and vocals steeped in gospel and blues traditions rather than attempting a purely nostalgic recreation.[1][2][3] Over time they have become a respected bridge between generations, appearing at events such as the Ponderosa Stomp, London’s Barbican Centre, Lincoln Center’s Midsummer Night Swing, and international festivals, and serving as a living continuation of the Memphis soul legacy through both their recordings and their members’ ongoing educational and session work.[1][3][6]

## Fun Facts
- The Bo-Keys were initially assembled simply as a one-off backing band for Stax songwriter Sir Mack Rice, but the chemistry among the musicians led Scott Bomar to keep the group together as a full-time project.[1][2]
- Guitarist Charles “Skip” Pitts brought with him one of the most recognizable riffs in soul and film history: he played the iconic wah‑wah guitar line on Isaac Hayes’ 1971 *Shaft* theme long before joining the Bo-Keys.[1]
- Trumpeter and vocalist Ben Cauley, an original Bo-Keys member, was the only survivor of the 1967 plane crash that killed Otis Redding and most of the Bar-Kays, giving the band a direct personal link to one of soul music’s most storied tragedies.[1][7]
- The Bo-Keys not only record vintage-flavored soul albums but also crossed into film, performing the score for the Academy Award–winning movie *Hustle & Flow* and contributing music to the animated feature *Barnyard*.[1][8]

- [[younger_memphis_soul_and_roots_musicians_collective|Younger Memphis soul and roots musicians (collective)]] - By bringing original Stax and Hi players together with contemporary bandleaders and appearing at educational institutions like the Stax Music Academy, the Bo-Keys have helped transmit classic Memphis soul performance practice to newer generations; this influence is broadly noted but not tied to specific named protégés.
