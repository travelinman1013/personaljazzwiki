# Benny Grunch

## Biography
Benny Grunch, whose real name is Benny Antin, was born and raised in the Lakeview neighborhood of New Orleans, Louisiana. He began playing music at a young age, taking guitar lessons in 1956 after being expelled from St. Dominic’s school, and quickly became a natural talent, performing on Bourbon Street venues like the Sho Bar and Gunga Den by age 16, covering early New Orleans rhythm-and-blues hits by artists such as Ernie K-Doe and Fats Domino while backing burlesque acts.[1][2] Antin attended St. Aloysius High School and later Southeastern Louisiana University for about three years without graduating, during which he formed early bands including the Dirty Virgins, leading to a brief suspension over provocative flyers.[1][2]

While at Southeastern, Antin formed the band that evolved into Benny Grunch & the Bunch after a gig where the name 'Lena Grunch’s Bunch'—inspired by a fictional character from a flyer and local lore about 'Grunch Road'—stuck, with fans dubbing him Benny Grunch.[1][2] He toured nationally from 1967 to 1972 playing contemporary rock hits until his daughter Angel was born, then returned to New Orleans for local rock and roll gigs, later specializing in satirical holiday parodies blending Cajun, Christmas, rhythm-and-blues, and second-line styles.[1][2][4] His breakthrough came with the '12 Yats of Christmas' in the early 2000s, now a New Orleans holiday tradition alongside songs like 'Ain’t Dere No More.'[1]

Now in his late 60s (age 68 as of around 2019), Antin resides in Lakeview with partner Becky, has one daughter and two grandchildren, and despite rheumatoid arthritis and a stroke in June 2021, continues writing and performing at events like Jazz Fest and Mardi Gras celebrations, earning the title 'King of Christmas' after over 40 years in music.[1][2][4][5][6]

## Fun Facts
- The band name 'Benny Grunch & the Bunch' originated from a college flyer promoting 'Lena Grunch loves the Dirty Virgins,' which got him suspended; fans then chanted 'Benny Grunch' by night's end.[1]
- As a teenager, he played marathon sets starting at 3 a.m. in Bourbon Street strip clubs backing burlesque dancers like Reddi Flame, whose polka-dot Buick he recognized near his Lakeview home.[2]
- He nearly got expelled from Southeastern over a flyer, with the dean vowing to find the mysterious 'Grunch woman.'[1]
- Despite a 2021 stroke and rheumatoid arthritis, he rides motorcycles to visit his daughter in Denver.[1][5]
