## Biography
The Coffinshakers are a Swedish band formed in 1995 in Karlstad by frontman Rob Coffinshaker (Robert Fjällsby). Emerging from the underground with limited-run red vinyl singles and sporadic live shows, the band initially played to small, often indifferent audiences. Their debut single, 'Dracula Has Risen from the Grave,' released in 1996, set the tone for their unique blend of horror-inspired lyrics and classic country stylings. The original lineup featured Rob Coffinshaker on vocals and guitar, Joe Undertaker on bass, Fang on electric guitar, and Andy Bones on drums, who replaced Blackfist Bill in 2000.

The Coffinshakers are renowned for merging the somber, narrative-driven traditions of Johnny Cash and Waylon Jennings with the macabre imagery of German expressionist cinema and Hammer horror films. Their music, sometimes described as 'graveyard country,' also incorporates elements of surf rock and gothic horror, drawing on influences like Ennio Morricone and The Ventures. Their first full-length album, 'We Are the Undead' (1999), and the self-titled 'The Coffinshakers' (2007) earned them a cult following, particularly in Finland, where they briefly entered the Top 40. Despite long periods of inactivity, the band has maintained a devoted fanbase, with their rare releases becoming sought-after collector's items.

The Coffinshakers' legacy lies in their ability to carve out a distinct niche at the crossroads of psychobilly, horror punk, and southern gothic. Their darkly theatrical performances and haunting melodies have influenced a new generation of artists in the horror country and psychobilly scenes, ensuring their continued relevance in underground music circles.
