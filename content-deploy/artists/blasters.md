## Biography
The Blasters are an American roots rock and rockabilly band formed in 1979 in Downey, California, by brothers Phil Alvin (vocals, guitar) and Dave Alvin (guitar), joined by bassist John Bazz and drummer Bill Bateman. Raised in a musically rich environment in southeast Los Angeles, the Alvin brothers were mentored by blues and R&B legends such as T-Bone Walker and Big Joe Turner, which deeply influenced their musical direction[3]. The band quickly became a fixture in the burgeoning Los Angeles punk and roots scene of the early 1980s, sharing stages with acts like X and Los Lobos, and gaining a reputation for their electrifying live performances that blended blues, rockabilly, country, R&B, and rock & roll[2][3].

Their debut album, 'American Music' (1980), recorded for the Rollin' Rock label, became a cult classic and helped define the American roots rock movement[1][2][3]. The Blasters' subsequent albums, including 'The Blasters,' 'Non-Fiction,' and 'Hard Line,' showcased Dave Alvin's songwriting and expanded the band's lineup to include musicians like pianist Gene Taylor and saxophonist Lee Allen. The band received praise from major artists such as Bruce Springsteen and Eric Clapton, and their songs appeared in films like 'Bull Durham.' Despite lineup changes—most notably Dave Alvin's departure in 1986—the band, led by Phil Alvin, has continued to perform and record, maintaining their reputation as one of Americana's most credible and enduring acts[2][3].

The Blasters' legacy lies in their passionate commitment to 'American Music,' a term they used to describe their synthesis of classic American genres. Their influence extends to both their contemporaries and later generations of roots and rock musicians, and their live shows remain celebrated for their energy and authenticity[3].
