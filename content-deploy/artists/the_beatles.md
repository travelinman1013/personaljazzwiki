## Biography
The Beatles were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960, comprising John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr. Their origins trace back to the late 1950s, when Lennon and McCartney first met and began playing together in the Quarrymen, later joined by Harrison and, after several lineup changes, Starr. The group built their reputation through relentless performances in Liverpool and Hamburg, refining their sound and stagecraft before signing with EMI in 1962. Their debut single 'Love Me Do' marked the start of a meteoric rise, leading to the global phenomenon of 'Beatlemania.'[3][5][6]

Musically, The Beatles drew inspiration from American rock and roll, skiffle, and rhythm and blues, but quickly evolved to incorporate elements of classical music, Indian music, psychedelia, and hard rock. Their innovative songwriting, studio experimentation, and artistic presentation—especially under the guidance of producer George Martin—set new standards in popular music. Landmark albums such as 'Rubber Soul,' 'Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band,' and 'The White Album' showcased their versatility and creativity, influencing countless musicians and shaping the sound of the 1960s.[3][4][5]

The Beatles' impact extended far beyond music, affecting fashion, youth culture, and social attitudes. After their breakup in 1970, each member pursued solo careers, with Lennon and Harrison later passing away. Despite their relatively brief existence as a band, The Beatles remain widely regarded as the most influential group in the history of popular music, with a legacy that continues to inspire new generations.[3][5]
