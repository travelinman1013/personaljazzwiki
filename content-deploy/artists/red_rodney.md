## Biography
Red Rodney, born Robert Roland Chudnick on September 27, 1927 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, emerged as one of the most technically gifted and influential jazz trumpeters of the bebop and hard bop eras[1][2][3][4]. He began playing professionally as a teenager, joining prominent big bands led by Jerry Wald, Jimmy Dorsey, Georgie Auld, Elliot Lawrence, Benny Goodman, and Les Brown in the mid-1940s[1][2][4]. Inspired by the revolutionary sounds of Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker, Rodney shifted his style towards bebop and soon became a sought-after soloist for bands led by Claude Thornhill, Gene Krupa, and Woody Herman[1][2][4].

Rodney's career reached a pivotal moment in 1949 when Charlie Parker invited him to join his quintet, replacing Miles Davis[1][2][3][4]. As the only white member of the group, Rodney was sometimes billed as "Albino Red" during Southern tours to circumvent racial prejudice[1][2][5][6]. His tenure with Parker solidified his reputation as one of bebop's finest trumpeters, but his progress was repeatedly disrupted by heroin addiction and legal troubles, including a prison sentence in the 1950s[1][2][3][4]. After periods of obscurity and work in Las Vegas pit orchestras, Rodney made a remarkable comeback in the 1970s, collaborating extensively with Ira Sullivan and later with Rolling Stones drummer Charlie Watts[1][3][4]. He continued to perform, record, and mentor younger musicians until his death from lung cancer in Boynton Beach, Florida on May 27, 1994[1][2][4].

Rodney's musical style was characterized by a brilliant tone, agile phrasing, and a deep understanding of bebop and post-bop idioms[6][7]. His legacy includes not only his recordings and performances but also his role as a mentor and consultant, notably for Clint Eastwood's film "Bird" about Charlie Parker[1][3][4]. He was inducted into the Down Beat Hall of Fame in 1990 and is remembered as a pioneering figure who bridged racial divides and inspired generations of jazz musicians[4].
