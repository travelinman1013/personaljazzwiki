## Biography
Arnett Cobb, born Arnette Cleophus Cobbs on August 10, 1918, in Houston, Texas, emerged as one of the most dynamic tenor saxophonists in jazz. Taught piano by his grandmother and later studying violin, Cobb ultimately gravitated to the tenor saxophone during his high school years at Wheatley High School. By age fifteen, he was already performing professionally with Frank Davis’s band, later working with Chester Boone, and then becoming a founding member of the Milton Larkin Orchestra in 1936. This group, which included future stars like Illinois Jacquet and Eddie Vinson, became a leading force in the Texas swing and blues scene, performing at prestigious venues such as Harlem’s Apollo Theatre and Joe Louis’s Rhumboogie Club in Chicago.

Cobb's national breakthrough came in 1942 when he joined Lionel Hampton’s orchestra, replacing Illinois Jacquet as lead tenor saxophonist. His robust, exuberant style—often described as the “open prairie” tone and “southern preacher” style—quickly earned him the nickname 'Wild Man of the Tenor Sax.' Cobb was a featured soloist, arranger, and writer with Hampton for five years, contributing to iconic recordings like 'Flying Home No. 2.' After leaving Hampton in 1947, Cobb led his own groups, recorded prolifically for labels such as Prestige and Muse, and overcame significant health setbacks, including a car accident in 1956 that left him reliant on crutches. Despite these challenges, he continued to perform, record, and mentor younger musicians, especially after returning to Houston in 1959. He remained active internationally into the 1980s and played a pivotal role in preserving Texas jazz heritage until his death on March 24, 1989.

Cobb’s legacy is marked by his powerful, blues-infused sound and his influence on generations of saxophonists in jazz, R&B, and soul. He was recognized with a Grammy nomination in 1979 and shared a Grammy with B.B. King in 1984. Through his performances, recordings, and educational efforts, Cobb helped shape the Texas Tenor tradition and left an indelible mark on American music.
