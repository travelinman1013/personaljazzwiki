## Biography
The Arcadian Serenaders were a prominent jazz band active during the 1920s, originally known as the Original Crescent City Jazzers. The group was formed by white musicians from New Orleans and initially performed under their original name before relocating to St. Louis in 1925, where they adopted the Arcadian Serenaders moniker. Their move coincided with regular performances at the Arcadian Ballroom, a major jazz venue in St. Louis at the time, which helped them gain regional popularity and recognition for their energetic style and skilled musicianship.[1][4][5]

The band's musical style was rooted in early New Orleans jazz traditions, characterized by lively ensemble playing, syncopated rhythms, and collective improvisation. Their repertoire included popular jazz standards and original compositions, such as "Christine" and "Sensation Rag," which were recorded in New Orleans in 1925 for the Okeh label. The Arcadian Serenaders contributed to the spread of jazz from its New Orleans origins to other parts of the United States, particularly through their performances and recordings in St. Louis.[4]

Despite their relatively brief period of activity, the Arcadian Serenaders left a lasting legacy as part of the early wave of jazz bands that helped popularize the genre beyond its birthplace. Their recordings are considered valuable examples of 1920s jazz, and the band is remembered for its role in bridging the New Orleans and St. Louis jazz scenes, influencing subsequent generations of musicians who drew inspiration from their spirited performances and arrangements.[1][4][5]
