## Biography
Scott H. Biram, born in 1974 in Prairie Lea, Texas, is a genre-defying musician known for his raw blend of blues, outlaw country, punk, and Americana. Growing up between a pig farm and an oilfield, Biram absorbed the gritty realities of rural Texas, which would later infuse his music with authenticity and edge. He spent his early years in Prairie Lea before moving to San Marcos, a town whose rough-and-tumble spirit left a lasting mark on his songwriting and persona.[2]

Biram began his musical journey in the 1990s, playing in bluegrass bands and the punk outfit The Thangs. By 1994, he started experimenting with solo acoustic shows, eventually forging his signature 'dirty old one-man band' act after his last band dissolved in 2001. His performances are notorious for their intensity, combining blues, country, rock, gospel, and even metal influences, all delivered with a preacher’s fervor and a punk’s energy. After self-releasing three albums, Biram signed with Bloodshot Records in 2005, continuing to tour relentlessly and release acclaimed records such as 'Fever Dreams' and 'The One & Only Scott H. Biram.'[2][3][6]

Biram’s style is characterized by gritty vocals, stomping rhythms, and a DIY approach, often performing with a battered Gibson guitar and a custom stomp board. His music pays homage to blues legends like Lead Belly and Rev. Gary Davis, while also channeling the rebellious spirit of punk and outlaw country. Widely respected for his uncompromising artistry and electrifying live shows, Biram has carved out a unique legacy as a true original in American roots music.[2][3][5]
