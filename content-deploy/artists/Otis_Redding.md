## Biography
Otis Redding, born on September 9, 1941, in Dawson, Georgia, was raised in Macon, where his early exposure to gospel music in his father's church and the sounds of Sam Cooke and Little Richard shaped his powerful, emotive vocal style. Redding began performing with local bands as a teenager, eventually joining Johnny Jenkins and the Pinetoppers, and briefly the Upsetters, Little Richard’s former band. His breakthrough came in 1962 at Stax Records in Memphis, where he recorded 'These Arms of Mine,' launching a prolific recording career characterized by energetic performances and soulful ballads.

Throughout the mid-1960s, Redding became a leading figure in soul music, recording hits such as 'I've Been Loving You Too Long,' 'Respect,' and 'Try a Little Tenderness.' His dynamic stage presence and heartfelt delivery won him acclaim across racial boundaries, especially after his show-stopping performance at the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival. Redding’s creative ambitions expanded in his later years, as evidenced by the introspective '(Sittin’ On) The Dock of the Bay,' which he co-wrote just days before his untimely death in a plane crash on December 10, 1967, at age 26. The song became a posthumous No. 1 hit, cementing his legacy as one of the most influential soul artists of all time.

Redding’s impact on music endures through his recordings and the generations of artists he inspired. His blend of gospel, rhythm and blues, and raw emotional honesty set a standard for soul music, earning him numerous posthumous honors, including induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.
