## Biography
Clarence Wheeler was a Chicago-based tenor saxophonist and bandleader best known for his work with the jazz-funk group Clarence Wheeler & The Enforcers in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Despite being a relatively obscure figure, Wheeler's contributions to the soul jazz and funk jazz genres are notable, particularly through his group's energetic and innovative recordings. The Enforcers, formed in Chicago, featured Wheeler alongside trumpeter Sonny Covington, organist Sonny Burke, and drummer George Hughes. Their debut album, 'Doin’ What We Wanna,' recorded in November 1969 and released by Atlantic Records in 1970, is widely regarded as a classic of the genre, blending New Orleans funk with the robust jazz traditions of Chicago’s South Side.[1][2][4][5]

Wheeler’s career was marked by collaborations with prominent organists such as Jack McDuff and Don Patterson, which helped shape his soulful, groove-oriented approach to jazz. The Enforcers' sound was further enriched by the contributions of vocalists like Cissy Houston, Judy Clay, and Jackie Verdell, and the group went on to release two more albums on Atlantic: 'The Love I’ve Been Looking For' (1971) and 'New Chicago Blues' (1973). Wheeler was recognized for his clever arrangements and ability to fuse funk, modern jazz, and soul into a cohesive and uplifting musical experience. His work, though not widely known during his lifetime, has since been rediscovered and celebrated by jazz and funk enthusiasts.[1][2][4][5]

Clarence Wheeler passed away at age 72, leaving behind a legacy as a passionate musician who brought together some of the finest talents in Chicago’s jazz scene. His recordings with The Enforcers continue to inspire new generations of musicians and listeners, standing as vibrant examples of the creative possibilities within jazz-funk and soul jazz.[6]
