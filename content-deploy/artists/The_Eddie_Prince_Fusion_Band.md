## Biography
The Eddie Prince Fusion Band is a fictional jazz fusion ensemble created by acclaimed producer and DJ Madlib as part of his sprawling universe of imaginary jazz groups. Emerging in the mid-2000s, the band was conceived as a playful homage to the experimental jazz and fusion collectives of the 1970s and 1980s, blending elements of jazz, funk, and avant-garde improvisation. The group is best known for its appearance on releases associated with Madlib's 'Yesterdays Universe' project, which celebrated the spirit of jazz innovation through a series of pseudonymous acts.

The band’s only known track, 'Mtume's Song,' references the influential jazz and R&B musician James Mtume, further underscoring the project’s roots in jazz history and fusion traditions. While The Eddie Prince Fusion Band never existed as a performing or recording group in the traditional sense, its inclusion in Madlib’s discography reflects the producer’s deep reverence for jazz’s collaborative and boundary-pushing ethos. The project stands as a testament to Madlib’s creativity and his ability to blur the lines between reality and fiction in music.

Though the band itself has no direct legacy, its fictional existence contributes to the mythos of Madlib’s work, inspiring listeners to explore the rich tapestry of jazz fusion and the playful possibilities of musical storytelling.
