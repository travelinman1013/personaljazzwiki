## Biography
Joyce Moreno, born Joyce Silveira Palhano de Jesus on January 31, 1948, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, is a celebrated singer, composer, guitarist, and arranger whose career has spanned more than five decades. She began playing guitar at age fourteen, inspired by her brother, and quickly immersed herself in the vibrant bossa nova scene of the late 1950s and 1960s. By the late 1960s, Joyce had already recorded her debut album and was recognized for her distinctive voice and songwriting, which often offered a female perspective that was rare in Brazilian popular music at the time[2][7].

Her career flourished both in Brazil and internationally, despite facing censorship during Brazil’s military dictatorship. Joyce became known for her sophisticated blend of bossa nova, samba, and jazz, and her collaborations with leading figures in Música Popular Brasileira (MPB). In 2000, she recorded the album 'Tudo Bonito' with João Donato, marking the beginning of a fruitful partnership. Donato, a legendary pianist and composer, brought his own innovative jazz and bossa nova sensibilities to their collaborations, further enriching Joyce’s sound. Together, they have performed and recorded extensively, contributing to the legacy of Brazilian music[1][2].

Joyce Moreno’s influence extends beyond performance: she has authored books, hosted television series about Brazilian music, and taught workshops worldwide. Her legacy is marked by her pioneering role as a female songwriter in Brazil, her innovative musical style, and her ability to bridge traditional and contemporary sounds. João Donato, her frequent collaborator, is himself a key architect of bossa nova and Latin jazz, known for his rhythmic inventiveness and melodic sophistication.
