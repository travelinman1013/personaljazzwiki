## Biography
Hermanos Gutiérrez is a Swiss-Ecuadorian guitar duo consisting of brothers Estevan and Alejandro Gutiérrez, known for their atmospheric, reverb-drenched instrumental sound blending música mexicana and bolero genres. Raised in Switzerland by an Ecuadorian mother and Swiss father, they frequently visited family in Playas, Ecuador. Estevan began learning classical guitar around age nine, focusing on Latin styles like milonga and salsa, and drew inspiration from surf rocker **Jack Johnson** as a surfer himself. Alejandro, eight years younger, taught himself guitar via YouTube tutorials. The duo formed in 2015 during a jam session in Alejandro's Zürich apartment.[4]

Their career gained momentum with recent high-profile collaborations, particularly with **Jack Johnson**, a childhood hero for Estevan. In 2025, they co-wrote and performed Johnson's single 'Hold On To The Light' for his documentary *SURFILMUSIC*, which revisits his early surf films *Thicker Than Water* (1999) and *September Sessions* (2000). The track evolved from a guitar riff by Alejandro, to which Johnson added lyrics, and was debuted live with **G. Love** during a SoCal Sound session. They also joined Johnson for performances on *Jimmy Kimmel Live!* and are set to tour together in 2026, including Hollywood Bowl dates, showcasing their intertwined guitar lines and chemistry despite recent formation.[1][2][3][7]

Hermanos Gutiérrez's style emphasizes instrumental guitar work with heavy reverb, evoking cinematic and hopeful atmospheres, as heard in tracks like 'Cerca De Ti'. Their collaboration with Johnson highlights a full-circle moment, bridging surf culture, friendship, and creativity, while building on their 2022 SoCal Sound appearance.[1][4]
