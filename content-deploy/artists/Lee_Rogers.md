## Biography
Lee Rogers is an Irish singer-songwriter and musician living in a small town just outside Belfast, Northern Ireland. His music reflects the resilient, scarred beauty of his legendary territory, with robust and resplendent songs that absorb listeners through open-hearted, lyrical storytelling that evokes both tender wisdom and elegiac musical craftsmanship. Rogers comes from a unique background - his father was a second-generation settled Gypsy with distinctive features including black hair, swarthy skin, green eyes, gold hoop earrings, and old Indian-inked tattoos, possessing both a fighting spirit and a soft heart for his family.

Rogers has released five major recordings with three official releases, establishing himself as a tender yet macho Noir outcast who provides musical solidarity to fellow wounded exile-pioneers. His 2022 album 'Gameblood' represents a truer reflection of himself and his stories, exploring themes of love, lust, life, death, and addiction with what he describes as 'music for the grown-up mind.' The album was recorded at Sycamore Studios and showcases his evolution as an artist who harnesses and heals through his musical process. Beyond music, Rogers worked as a tattoo artist for many years, bringing that field's attention to human vulnerability and creative detail to his musical artistry.

## Fun Facts
- Rogers was genuinely drunk during the filming of his 'Life and Lies' music video in a Belfast bar, requiring little acting for the authentic performance
- He wrote the song 'Uneasy Love' after having a vivid dream about a deceased former partner who had traveled with him across Australia and influenced many of his better life choices
- The album title 'Gameblood' comes from his interpretation of his father's fighting spirit, representing resilience inherited from his Gypsy heritage
- Rogers has been working with the same group of musicians for over two decades, creating a tight-knit musical family
