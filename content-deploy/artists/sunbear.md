## Biography
Sunbear was a Los Angeles-based soul and jazz-funk vocal duo formed in 1977 by singer/drummer Arnie Oliver (also known as Ahaguna G. Sun) and singer/guitarist Werner "Bear" Schuchner. The group was signed to Soul Train Records, a label founded by Don Cornelius and Dick Griffey, and released their self-titled debut album that same year. Their sound was heavily influenced by the sophisticated arrangements and energetic grooves of Earth, Wind & Fire, with additional stylistic nods to Tower of Power and El Chicano. 

Despite their musical promise and the involvement of prominent producers, Sunbear disbanded after their debut, never recording a follow-up. Both members continued to contribute to the R&B and soul music scenes: Oliver joined the acclaimed band Maze (led by Frankie Beverly), while Schuchner became a sought-after session guitarist, working with acts such as The Whispers, Soul Train Gang, and High Inergy. Sunbear’s legacy endures through their rare album and the song "Fantasy," which was later covered by The Whispers on their hit album 'Imagination' in 1980.
