## Biography
Teezo Touchdown, born Aaron Lashane Thomas on October 31, 1992, in Beaumont, Texas, is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, and record producer known for his eclectic style and genre-blending approach. Raised in a musical household—his father was a DJ—Teezo was exposed to a wide range of music from an early age, including rock, funk, hip-hop, and electronic, which deeply influenced his later work. He began experimenting with music production and DJing in his youth, uploading early tracks to YouTube under various aliases before adopting the Teezo Touchdown moniker in 2016.[2][4][5]

Teezo's career gained traction in the late 2010s with a series of mixtapes and viral singles that showcased his unique fusion of pop-punk, rap, and alternative sounds. His visual aesthetic—marked by outlandish costumes and nail-studded hairstyles—helped him stand out in the crowded music landscape. In 2023, he released his debut studio album, 'How Do You Sleep at Night?', featuring collaborations with artists such as Fousheé, Janelle Monáe, and Isaiah Rusk. Teezo's work is characterized by a playful, genre-defying approach, blending emo, punk, and hip-hop influences, and his legacy is rapidly growing as he continues to collaborate with high-profile artists and push musical boundaries.[2][3][6]

Fousheé, featured on Teezo's track 'Sweet,' is an American singer-songwriter from New Jersey with Jamaican roots. She rose to prominence when her vocals were sampled in Sleepy Hallow's viral hit 'Deep End Freestyle.' Fousheé is known for her soulful, genre-crossing style and has collaborated with artists such as Steve Lacy, Vince Staples, and Lil Yachty. Her background in classical music and performance, combined with her innovative songwriting, has made her a sought-after collaborator in contemporary R&B and alternative music.[1]
