## Biography
Barb Jungr, born May 9, 1954, in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, England, is a celebrated British vocalist, composer, and lyricist renowned for her distinctive interpretations of classic songs and her contributions to vocal jazz and cabaret[5]. Raised in the northwest of England to parents of Czech and German descent, Jungr emerged from the UK’s Alternative Cabaret scene in the 1970s, working alongside now-legendary comedians such as Julian Clary, Alexei Sayle, and Arnold Brown before focusing on her musical career[3][4]. Her early work laid the foundation for her signature approach: creating themed shows that blend storytelling with musical innovation, a style that has earned her international acclaim and comparisons to Nina Simone, Peggy Lee, and Edith Piaf[3]. Jungr’s career took off with a series of acclaimed releases on Linn Records, followed by albums on Naim and her own Kristalyn Records, and she has toured extensively across Europe, Australia, and the United States, including notable residencies at New York’s Café Carlyle, Metropolitan Room, and Joe’s Pub[3][6]. Critics have praised her as “one of the best interpreters of Jacques Brel and Bob Dylan anywhere” and “a true musical alchemist,” highlighting her ability to reveal new depths in familiar material through her “mesmerizing” voice and theatrical delivery[3][6]. Beyond performing, Jungr is a respected writer and lyricist, with credits including musical adaptations of The Jungle Book, Cinderella, Beauty and The Beast, and Dick Whittington[3]. Her legacy is that of a fearless interpreter and innovator, continually expanding the boundaries of vocal jazz and cabaret.
