## Biography
LADAMA is a Latin alternative band formed in 2014 by women musicians and activists Lara Klaus from Brazil, Daniela Serna from Colombia, Maria 'Mafer Bandola' González Olivo from Venezuela, and initially Sara Lucas from the United States. The group originated during the OneBeat Program, a U.S. State Department fellowship, while the founding members toured the West Coast, leading to collaborations in youth workshops and performances that evolved into a touring ensemble blending South American folk traditions with soul, R&B, and pop.[1][2][3] Their self-titled debut album, released on September 8, 2017, by Six Degrees Records, topped iTunes and Amazon Latin Music charts, featuring genres like cumbia, maracatu, and joropo, and was praised for its cross-continental musical exchange.[1][3]

LADAMA's second album, *Oye Mujer* ('Hey Woman'), released July 10, 2020, emphasized female empowerment amid global crises, produced with Brazilian producer Kassin and frequent bassist Pat Swoboda, showcasing matured unity with each member taking lead vocals and electric arrangements.[1][3][4] The band has performed at high-profile events like TED, Monterey Jazz Festival, and NPR's All Things Considered, which lauded their 'irresistible spirit and universal appeal.' Sara Lucas departed in 2023, leaving the core trio of Klaus, Serna, and Bandola, who continue releasing singles like 'Cuido Mi Raíz' (2024).[1][4]

Beyond music, LADAMA engages communities globally through workshops on music-making, composition, and production, targeting youth and women, rooted in their mission to empower via sound.[2][3][4]
