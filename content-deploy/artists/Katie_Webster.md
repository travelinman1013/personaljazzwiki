## Biography
Katie Webster, born Kathryn Jewel Thorne on January 11, 1936, in Houston, Texas, was a prodigious boogie-woogie and blues pianist whose career spanned several decades and bridged the musical traditions of Texas and Louisiana. Raised by parents who were both pianists—her father a ragtime player and her mother a classical musician—Webster was encouraged toward classical music but found herself irresistibly drawn to the vibrant sounds of Fats Domino, Little Richard, and Ray Charles, which she listened to secretly on the radio[2][7]. By her early teens, she was performing professionally in Beaumont and Lake Charles, quickly becoming a sought-after session musician for Goldband and Excello Records, contributing her distinctive barrelhouse piano style to hundreds of recordings with artists such as Lightnin' Slim, Lazy Lester, and Lonesome Sundown[1][5][7].

Webster's career reached a turning point in the mid-1960s when Otis Redding, impressed by her performance at the Bamboo Club in Lake Charles, invited her to join his touring band. She toured with Redding until his death in 1967, after which she entered a period of semi-retirement, moving to Oakland to care for her parents[1][2][7]. The late 1970s and 1980s saw a resurgence in her career, fueled by reissues of her earlier work and enthusiastic audiences in Europe. Webster recorded several acclaimed albums, including 'Swamp Boogie Queen'—featuring Bonnie Raitt and Robert Cray—and 'Two-Fisted Mama!' She became a fixture at major blues festivals and continued to perform internationally until her death from heart failure in League City, Texas, in 1999[1][5][7].

Webster's musical style blended boogie-woogie, blues, and swamp pop, characterized by her powerful piano technique, expressive vocals, and energetic stage presence. She is remembered as a pioneering figure who helped define the swamp blues sound of the Texas-Louisiana borderlands, inspiring generations of musicians and earning the nickname 'Swamp Boogie Queen'[1][5][7].

- Webster suffered a stroke while touring Greece in 1993 but returned to performing the following year[1].
