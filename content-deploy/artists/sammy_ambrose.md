## Biography
Sammy Ambrose, born Sam Otis Ambrose in Harlem, New York in 1940, emerged as a soulful voice in the American doo-wop and R&B scenes of the early 1960s. He began his musical journey as a member of the doo-wop group The Willows, a group rooted in the rich vocal traditions of Harlem. Ambrose's early exposure to New York's vibrant music culture shaped his expressive vocal style, blending elements of doo-wop, soul, and R&B.

Ambrose's solo career took off in the early 1960s, recording for several labels including Carnival, West Side, Mala, and Musicor. He fronted the group Sammy Ambrose & The Afro-Beats, collaborating with musicians like Joe Sanders, Moses Tillman, Charles Wright, and Sammy Williams. Among his notable recordings is the original version of 'This Diamond Ring' (1964), a song later made famous by Gary Lewis and The Playboys. While Ambrose's version did not achieve major commercial success, it remains a testament to his soulful delivery and the cross-pollination of R&B and pop during that era. Ambrose continued to record through the 1960s, leaving a modest but respected legacy in the soul and doo-wop genres before his untimely death in Dade County, Florida in 1988 at the age of 47.
