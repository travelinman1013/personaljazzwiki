## Biography
CocoRosie is an American experimental music group formed in 2003 by sisters Sierra Rose “Rosie” Casady and Bianca Leilani “Coco” Casady, who were born and raised in the United States but reunited creatively in Paris, France after spending much of their youth apart.[1][3][6] Sierra, the elder sister, was born in Iowa, while Bianca was born in Hawaii, and their peripatetic childhood included time with their artist mother and periods with their father, a spiritual seeker sometimes described as a Native American–influenced shaman, experiences that later fed into the group’s mystical, genre-blurring aesthetic.[3][7] Their stage name comes from childhood nicknames given by their mother, and they founded CocoRosie when Bianca, then living in New York, made an impromptu visit to Sierra’s Paris apartment; the pair began recording in the bathroom, chosen for its isolation and acoustics, using a single microphone, a broken pair of headphones, traditional instruments, and children’s toys to craft lo‑fi, intimate songs that would become their debut album, *La Maison de Mon Rêve* (2004).[1][3][6]

Initially intended only as a homemade release for friends, *La Maison de Mon Rêve* attracted the attention of independent label Touch and Go Records, which pursued and signed the duo, leading to an official release and unexpected critical acclaim.[1][3][6] CocoRosie went on to develop a distinctive style often labeled **freak folk**, **folktronica**, or part of the “New Weird America” movement, combining Sierra’s classically trained, operatic voice and harp, guitar, piano, and flute with Bianca’s idiosyncratic vocals, percussion, beatboxing, and an arsenal of found sounds and toys, all set against influences from pop, blues, opera, electronica, and hip hop.[1][3][4] Over the following years they became a prolific touring and recording act, releasing a string of albums including *Noah’s Ark* (2005), *The Adventures of Ghosthorse and Stillborn* (2007), *Grey Oceans* (2010), *Tales of a GrassWidow* (2013), *Heartache City* (2015), and *Put the Shine On* (2020), frequently expanding their live lineup with backing musicians such as bassists, keyboardists, synth players, and beatboxers while collaborating with visual artists and other musicians.[1][2][3]

CocoRosie’s work has attracted both devoted followers and polarized critical reactions, but they are widely recognized as key figures in early‑21st‑century experimental indie music, helping to popularize a hybrid of folk, electronic, and performance-art sensibilities.[1][3][4] They have been associated with and toured alongside artists from the indie and avant‑folk scenes, and their willingness to address themes such as gender, spirituality, childhood trauma, and politics—evident in releases like the 2017 protest single “Smoke ’em Out” featuring Anohni—has reinforced their reputation as boundary-pushing artists.[1] Their influence is reflected in the admiration of younger acts within the art‑pop and indie spheres, with bands such as The xx citing CocoRosie as a significant inspiration for their own stripped-down, emotionally charged approach to songwriting and production.[3]

## Fun Facts
- CocoRosie’s first recordings were made almost entirely in Sierra’s Paris bathroom, which they chose because it was the most isolated room with the best acoustics; much of *La Maison de Mon Rêve* was effectively a bathroom studio project.[1][3][6]
- Their debut album *La Maison de Mon Rêve* was never intended for commercial release—only a few copies were meant for friends—until Touch and Go Records heard it, actively pursued them, and persuaded the sisters to release it officially.[1][3][6]
- The group’s name comes directly from childhood nicknames given by their mother: Sierra was called “Rosie” and Bianca “Coco,” which they later combined into “CocoRosie.”[3]
- The sisters have spoken about going on vision quests with their father and engaging in unconventional spiritual practices when they were young, experiences that inform the surreal, ritualistic imagery and themes in their lyrics and visual art.[7]

## Musical Connections

### Mentors/Influences
- [[their_father_often_described_as_a_native_americaninfluenced_shamanvision-quest_guide|Their father (often described as a Native American–influenced shaman/vision-quest guide)]] - Spiritual and experiential influence from childhood vision quests and nontraditional upbringing, shaping their mystical and ritualistic artistic outlook rather than specific musical techniques. (Recurring spiritual and shamanic themes across albums such as *La Maison de Mon Rêve*, *The Adventures of Ghosthorse and Stillborn*, and *Grey Oceans*.) [Childhood through adolescence, referenced throughout their career.[7]]
- [[classicaloperatic_voice_teachers_for_sierra_casady|Classical/operatic voice teachers (for Sierra Casady)]] - Sierra formally studied operatic vocal techniques, which inform her distinctive, classical-inflected singing style in CocoRosie. (Operatic vocal approach heard prominently on tracks across *La Maison de Mon Rêve*, *Noah’s Ark*, and later albums.) [Pre‑2003 vocal training, continuing to influence recordings and performances.[1][3]]

### Key Collaborators
- [[anohni_formerly_antony_hegarty_of_antony_and_the_johnsons|Anohni (formerly Antony Hegarty of Antony and the Johnsons)]] - Featured guest vocalist and political collaborator on a protest single criticizing the election of Donald Trump. (Single “Smoke ’em Out.”) [2017.[1]]
- [[touch_and_go_records|Touch and Go Records]] - Independent label that discovered and actively pursued the band, releasing their debut and early recordings and helping bring them from a home project to an international audience. (Albums *La Maison de Mon Rêve* (2004), EP *Beautiful Boyz* (2004), and single “We Are On Fire” (2012).) [2004–2012.[1][6]]
- [[city_slang|City Slang]] - European independent label that released one of their mid‑career albums, supporting broader distribution and touring. (Album *Tales of a GrassWidow* (2013).) [Circa 2013.[1][2]]
- [[sub_pop|Sub Pop]] - Influential indie label associated with one of their major releases, aligning them with a roster of prominent alternative and experimental artists. (Album *Grey Oceans* (2010).) [Circa 2010.[2]]
- [[touring_partners_tv_on_the_radio_bright_eyes_battles_devendra_banhart_busdriver|Touring partners (TV on the Radio, Bright Eyes, Battles, Devendra Banhart, Busdriver)]] - Shared tours and bills across the U.S. and Europe, creating artistic cross-pollination within indie rock, experimental hip hop, and freak-folk scenes. (Various joint tours and live bills, particularly during the mid‑2000s.) [Primarily 2004 and subsequent touring years.[3]]

### Artists Influenced
- [[the_xx|The xx]] - Have cited CocoRosie as a major influence, drawing from their intimate, minimal, and emotionally direct approach as well as their blend of electronic and acoustic textures. (Early work such as The xx’s debut album reflects a similarly sparse, atmospheric, and emotionally raw sensibility that the band has linked to CocoRosie’s example.) [Late 2000s and 2010s, following CocoRosie’s early and mid‑career releases.[3]]
