## Biography
Stanley Jordan, born July 31, 1959, in Palo Alto, California, is an American jazz guitarist renowned for his groundbreaking 'touch technique'—an advanced form of two-handed tapping that allows him to play melody and chords simultaneously. Originally a classically trained pianist, Jordan adapted piano principles to the guitar, seeking greater freedom in voicing chords and ultimately developing a unique, fluid style that set him apart from his peers. 

Jordan's career took off in 1985 with the release of his debut album 'Magic Touch,' which not only achieved commercial and critical acclaim but also played a pivotal role in revitalizing Blue Note Records. The album’s innovative approach and radio-friendly covers, such as 'The Lady in My Life' and 'Eleanor Rigby,' propelled it to the top of the Billboard jazz chart for a record-breaking 51 weeks and earned gold status in the United States. Throughout his career, Jordan has demonstrated remarkable versatility, exploring genres from jazz fusion and smooth jazz to pop, rock, and classical, and is celebrated for both his technical mastery and expressive warmth.

Over the decades, Jordan has continued to push musical boundaries with projects like 'Standards Volume 1,' 'Flying Home,' 'Cornucopia,' and 'Bolero,' the latter featuring a 17-minute arrangement of Ravel’s classic that seamlessly blends rock, African, Latin, and industrial elements. Beyond performance, Jordan has contributed to music therapy and technology, notably creating the startup sound for the first generation of Power Macintosh computers, and remains a respected figure in the jazz world for his innovation and artistic vision.
