## Biography
Warner Williams, born in 1930 in Takoma Park, Maryland—a rural suburb of Washington, D.C. at the time—grew up in a musical family where his mother played accordion and his father played guitar and piano. He began playing guitar at the age of six, developing into a versatile songster whose repertoire encompassed **Piedmont blues**, gospel, fiddle tunes, country, ragtime, jazz, and popular songs[1][2][3][7][8]. Takoma Park remained his lifelong base, shaping his connection to the Eastern Seaboard blues tradition.

Williams' career highlighted his mastery of **Piedmont blues**, a regional style from the Carolinas, Virginia, Maryland, and West Virginia, performed often with collaborators in the trio Little Bit of Blues. He gained recognition later in life, receiving the prestigious 2011 National Heritage Fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts—the U.S. government's highest honor in folk and traditional arts—for his contributions[2][8]. Albums like *Blues Highway* (Smithsonian Folkways) showcased his fingerpicking guitar skills and vast songbook spanning blues standards to pop tunes[6].

Williams passed away on September 19, 2021, at age 91, leaving a legacy as one of the greatest unsung heroes of Piedmont blues, celebrated for his boundless repertoire and authentic style[2][5].
