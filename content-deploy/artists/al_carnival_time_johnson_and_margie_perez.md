## Biography
Al 'Carnival Time' Johnson, born June 20, 1939, in New Orleans, Louisiana, grew up in the Ninth Ward neighborhood, where his father encouraged his musical interests by purchasing instruments for him and his siblings. Inspired by New Orleans rhythm and blues pioneers like Fats Domino, Tommy Ridgley, and Smiley Lewis, Johnson chose the piano to emulate their sound and began his career at age 17, recording 'Ole Time Talkin'' and 'I've Done Wrong' for Aladdin Records in 1956. He later signed with Ric Records, recording at Cosimo Matassa's studio, including 'Lena' in 1958, and achieved lasting fame with his 1960 Mardi Gras hit 'Carnival Time,' produced by Joe Ruffino, which became a New Orleans classic alongside tracks by Professor Longhair and The Hawketts.[1][3]

After military service at Fort Bliss, Texas, Johnson returned to New Orleans in 1964 to find Ruffino deceased and entangled in legal battles over royalties, leaving him with little financial gain from his hits; he earned his nickname 'Carnival Time' from the song's success. Maintaining independence without a manager, he continued writing, recording, and performing, regaining full rights to 'Carnival Time' in 1999. In the 21st century, he released 'Mardi Gras Strut' (2006), 'Lower Ninth Ward Blues' (2007) post-Hurricane Katrina, and collaborated on tracks like 'Don't Go, Santa' with Margie Perez (2015) and 'Red Beans' with Bon Bon Vivant (2021).[1][3]

Johnson's legacy endures as a beloved New Orleans icon, inducted into the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame in 2007, reigning as King of Krewe Du Vieux (2005), and named Grand Marshall for Life of Krewe of Red Beans; he resides in Harry Connick Jr.'s Musicians' Village and continues performing in genres blending R&B and Mardi Gras traditions, often linked on platforms like Spotify with Cajun and zydeco alongside Margie Perez.[1][3]
