## Biography
The Zion Harmonizers are a legendary gospel group founded in 1938 by Benjamin J. Maxon, Jr., a teenager from the Zion City neighborhood of New Orleans, Louisiana. Drawing on the rich tradition of close-harmony singing that flourished in the city during the 1930s, Maxon formed the group with friends and family, including his brother Joe Maxon. Their early musical education was shaped by Maxon's aunt, Alberta French Johnson, leader of the esteemed Southern Harps, and the group soon became known for their quartet-style gospel harmonies, performing as the opening act for the Southern Harps and gaining recognition across Louisiana.[1][2]

As the group matured, they continued to refine their a cappella style and four-part harmonies, becoming a fixture in New Orleans gospel music. In 1942, Sherman Washington joined the group, eventually becoming its long-serving leader and guiding the Harmonizers for over six decades. Under Washington's leadership, the group recorded extensively, toured internationally, and became a perennial presence at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, where they anchored the Gospel Tent for over 40 years. Their sound, rooted in traditional gospel but open to contemporary influences, has made them a pillar of the New Orleans music community and a bridge between generations of gospel artists.[1][4][5]

The Zion Harmonizers' legacy is marked by their commitment to community, their role in nurturing local talent, and their enduring presence on the gospel stage. They have performed at major venues, recorded with numerous labels, and inspired countless musicians with their dedication to the spiritual and musical traditions of New Orleans. Even after the passing of key members such as Sherman Washington, the group continues to perform and record, maintaining their status as elder statesmen of gospel music.[4][5]
