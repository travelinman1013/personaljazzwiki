## Biography
Sarah Joyce, known professionally as Rumer, was born on 3 June 1979 in Islamabad, Pakistan, the youngest of seven children, where her family lived in an expatriate community near the Tarbela Dam due to her father's engineering work[1][2][4]. Her stage name is inspired by author Rumer Godden, and she spent her early years without TV or newspapers, often singing and writing songs with her family; her brother Rob gave her her first guitar, on which she self-taught and later composed her debut album[1][2][3]. She discovered at age 11 that her biological father was her family's Pakistani cook after her parents' divorce, prompting a return to England where she attended school in Carlisle until 16, then studied drama at Dartington College of Arts before moving to London, working in bands and as a waitress[2].

After her mother's breast cancer diagnosis and death in 2003, Rumer suffered a breakdown, lived in a caravan in the New Forest, joined a commune, and later sought her biological father in Pakistan only to learn he had died[2]. She pursued music seriously, releasing her debut single 'Slow' in 2010, which became Radio 2's single of the week, followed by her album Seasons of My Soul, earning Brit Award nominations and support from Burt Bacharach, Jools Holland, and Elton John[1][2]. Her style draws comparisons to Karen Carpenter, with influences from Aretha Franklin (to whom she dedicated a song), Dusty Springfield, Carole King, and Burt Bacharach, blending soul, pop, and retro vibes across albums like Into Colour (2014), Nashville Tears (2020), and covers such as This Girl's In Love (2016)[2][3].

Rumer has built a legacy as a distinctive British singer-songwriter, performing at festivals like Glastonbury, touring with Jools Holland, and gaining acclaim for her emotive voice and storytelling, inspiring others to follow their dreams after her own hard journey from school talent shows to international recognition[1][2].
