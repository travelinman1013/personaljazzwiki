## Biography
Sam Cooke, born January 22, 1931, in Clarksdale, Mississippi, was raised in Chicago as the son of a Baptist minister. His early exposure to gospel music shaped his formative years, and by age 15, he was already the lead singer of the Highway QC’s, a teenage gospel group. At 19, Cooke was hand-picked to replace R.H. Harris as lead singer of the Soul Stirrers, one of the most influential gospel groups of the era, where his light, soaring vocal style electrified audiences and produced gospel classics such as 'Nearer to Thee' and 'Touch the Hem of His Garment.'[1][4]

In 1957, Cooke made a groundbreaking transition from gospel to secular music, a move that was taboo in the Black musical community at the time. He quickly established himself as a romantic crooner with his first pop hit, 'You Send Me,' which topped the charts and helped bridge the gap between soul and pop for both Black and white audiences. Over the next eight years, Cooke released 29 singles that charted in the Top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100, including 'Chain Gang,' 'Cupid,' 'Twistin’ the Night Away,' and 'A Change Is Gonna Come.' His smooth, velvet-smooth voice and songwriting prowess defined the sweet soul sound, setting him apart from contemporaries who favored rawer styles.[1][2][3]

Cooke was also a pioneering businessman, founding his own record label (SAR Records), publishing, and management firms, and breaking racial barriers by performing in venues previously closed to Black artists. His tragic death in 1964 at age 33 cut short a career that had already transformed American music. Cooke’s legacy as the 'King of Soul' endures, having influenced generations of artists and helped lay the foundation for modern soul and R&B.[1][3][4][6]
