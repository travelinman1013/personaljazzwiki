## Biography
Dave Nelson, born Davidson C. Nelson in 1905 in Louisiana, was a prominent American jazz trumpet player, composer, and bandleader active during the early 20th century. He was notably the nephew of jazz legend King Oliver, which placed him at the heart of the New Orleans jazz tradition from an early age. Nelson's early musical development was shaped by his familial ties and the thriving jazz scene of his birthplace, where he quickly established himself as a skilled trumpeter.

Nelson's career gained momentum through his work with King Oliver's orchestra, where he contributed both as a performer and arranger. In 1931, he led two recording sessions under the name "Dave Nelson and The King's Men," assembling a group largely composed of musicians from Oliver's band. These sessions, recorded in New York, showcased Nelson's ability to blend the classic New Orleans jazz sound with the evolving big band style of the era. His arrangements and trumpet playing were marked by a lyrical, expressive quality that distinguished his recordings.

Though his career was relatively brief—Nelson died in 1946—his work as a bandleader and arranger left a lasting impression on the jazz world. His recordings with The King's Men are considered valuable documents of the transitional period between traditional New Orleans jazz and the swing era, and he is remembered for both his musical craftsmanship and his role in perpetuating the legacy of King Oliver.
