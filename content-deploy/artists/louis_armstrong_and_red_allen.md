## Biography
Louis Armstrong and Henry "Red" Allen were two of the most influential jazz trumpeters to emerge from New Orleans, each leaving a distinct mark on the development of jazz in the 20th century. Armstrong, born in 1901, revolutionized jazz with his virtuosic trumpet playing, charismatic stage presence, and innovative vocal style, becoming an international icon and one of the first African-American entertainers to gain widespread popularity across racial lines. His recordings, such as "What a Wonderful World" and "When the Saints Go Marching In," remain jazz standards[4][7].

Henry "Red" Allen, born in 1907, was recognized for his flamboyant and exploratory trumpet style, which served as a leading alternative to Armstrong's in the 1930s. Allen's playing was marked by rhythmic flexibility, harmonic innovation, and a personal sense of time, often pushing the boundaries of jazz improvisation[1][2]. Despite his originality, Allen spent part of his career in Armstrong's shadow, notably serving as a featured soloist and later as a supporting member in the Luis Russell Orchestra, which became Armstrong's backing band in the late 1930s[1][2][5].

The collaboration and occasional rivalry between Armstrong and Allen highlighted the dynamic evolution of jazz trumpet. While Armstrong's influence was foundational, Allen's avant-garde approach inspired later generations of trumpeters. Both artists contributed to the swing and big band eras, with Armstrong's charismatic leadership and Allen's technical mastery shaping the sound and direction of American jazz[1][2][4].
