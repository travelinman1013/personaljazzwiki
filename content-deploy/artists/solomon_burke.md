## Biography
Solomon Vincent McDonald Burke (born James Solomon McDonald, March 21, 1940 – October 10, 2010) was an American singer who played a pivotal role in shaping rhythm and blues and is recognized as one of the founding fathers of soul music in the 1960s[1][4]. Raised in West Philadelphia, Burke was a child prodigy in gospel, earning the nickname 'Wonder Boy Preacher' and founding his own ministry, Solomon’s Temple, by age twelve[2][7]. His early musical experiences were deeply rooted in gospel, jazz, country, and blues, which he blended into his own style at a time when R&B and rock were still evolving[1][4].

Burke’s career accelerated after signing with Atlantic Records in 1960, where he recorded a string of influential hits such as 'Cry to Me,' 'If You Need Me,' 'Got to Get You Off My Mind,' and 'Everybody Needs Somebody to Love'[1][2][4]. His powerful, smooth voice and ability to merge sacred and secular themes helped define the soul genre, bridging the gap between mainstream and grittier R&B[1][4]. Despite not achieving the chart success of some contemporaries, Burke was highly respected, with Atlantic Records executive Jerry Wexler calling him 'the greatest male soul singer of all time'[1][4].

Burke’s legacy is marked by his prodigious output and his status as a 'key transitional figure bridging R&B and soul.' He was honored with titles such as 'King Solomon,' 'King of Rock 'n' Soul,' and 'Bishop of Soul.' His influence extended beyond his own recordings, shaping the sound and spirit of soul music and inspiring generations of artists[1][4][2].
