## Biography
Joe Pesci, born Joseph Frank Pesci on February 9, 1943, in Newark, New Jersey, is an American actor and musician renowned for his dynamic range and memorable performances in both film and music. Pesci began his entertainment career in the 1960s, initially working as a barber while pursuing music. He played guitar with several bands, most notably Joey Dee and the Starliters, a group central to the early rock and roll scene and famous for the 'Peppermint Twist.' In 1968, he released his debut album 'Little Joe Sure Can Sing!' under the name Joe Ritchie, featuring covers of contemporary pop hits.

Pesci's musical style blends pop, jazz, and standards, often delivered with a playful or theatrical flair. After his early musical ventures, Pesci transitioned into comedy, forming the duo 'Vincent and Pesci' with Frank Vincent, before eventually finding fame as an actor. Despite his success in film, Pesci maintained his passion for music, releasing two more albums: 'Vincent LaGuardia Gambini Sings Just for You' (1998), inspired by his character from 'My Cousin Vinny,' and 'Pesci... Still Singing' (2019), which features collaborations with jazz musicians. Pesci's musical legacy is characterized by his versatility and his ability to bridge the worlds of entertainment, comedy, and music.
