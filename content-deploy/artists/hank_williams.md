## Biography
Hank Williams, born Hiram Williams on September 17, 1923, near Mount Olive, Alabama, is widely regarded as one of the most influential figures in the history of country music. Raised primarily by his mother after his parents separated, Williams grew up in poverty and struggled with a spinal condition, spina bifida, which contributed to his sense of isolation and later influenced his songwriting. He was introduced to music at a young age, learning harmonica and organ from his mother and guitar from African-American blues musician Rufus 'Tee Tot' Payne, whose blues phrasing and rhythms left a lasting mark on Williams' style.[1][2][3]

Williams began performing publicly as a teenager, forming his own band, the Drifting Cowboys, and gaining local fame through radio appearances in Montgomery, Alabama. His early career was marked by both promise and instability, as his growing dependence on alcohol made him an unreliable performer. Nevertheless, Williams' songwriting talent and emotive singing soon attracted the attention of Nashville music executives. After signing with MGM Records in 1947, he released a string of hits such as 'Move It On Over,' 'Lovesick Blues,' and 'Your Cheatin' Heart,' which propelled him to national stardom. His performances on the Louisiana Hayride and the Grand Ole Opry cemented his reputation as a country music superstar.[1][2][3]

Despite his success, Williams' personal life was troubled by substance abuse and chronic health problems, leading to his untimely death at age 29 on January 1, 1953. In his brief career, he recorded 55 singles that reached the top 10 of the Billboard Country & Western chart, with 12 reaching No. 1. Williams' legacy endures through his timeless songwriting, which helped transform country music from a regional genre to a national cultural force. He has influenced countless artists across genres and was posthumously honored with inductions into the Country Music Hall of Fame, the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, as well as receiving a Pulitzer Prize Special Citation for his songwriting.[1][2][3]
