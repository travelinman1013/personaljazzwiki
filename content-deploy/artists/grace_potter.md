## Biography
Grace Potter is an American singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and actress renowned for her dynamic stage presence and powerful vocals. Born on June 20, 1983, in Waitsfield, Vermont, Potter grew up in a musically supportive family, which encouraged her early interest in piano and singing. She attended St. Lawrence University, where she studied music and began to hone her songwriting and performance skills[1].

Potter's professional career began in 2002 when she formed the band Grace Potter and the Nocturnals with drummer Matt Burr and guitarist Scott Tournet in Vermont. The band quickly gained recognition for their energetic live shows and genre-blending sound, combining rock, blues, folk, and Americana influences[2]. Their self-titled album in 2010 brought commercial success and international attention, while subsequent releases like "The Lion The Beast The Beat" (2012) showcased Potter's evolving artistry. After the Nocturnals disbanded in 2015, Potter embarked on a solo career, releasing albums such as "Midnight" (2015), "Daylight" (2019, Grammy-nominated), and "Mother Road" (2023), each reflecting her personal and musical growth[3][4].

Potter's musical style is rooted in classic rock and blues, drawing vocal comparisons to icons like Janis Joplin and Bonnie Raitt[2][4]. Her legacy includes collaborations with major artists, contributions to film and television soundtracks, and a reputation for fearless creative exploration. She is celebrated for her ability to blend genres and her commitment to authentic, emotionally charged performances[3][5].
