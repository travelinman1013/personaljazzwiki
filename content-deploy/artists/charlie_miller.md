## Biography
Charlie Miller is a New Orleans-born jazz trumpet player who has established himself as a versatile and accomplished musician in the jazz and blues traditions.[3][4] Born and raised in New Orleans, Louisiana, Miller began his musical journey in an unconventional way, initially playing the family washing machine hose before receiving a beat-up old trumpet from an elderly gentleman at age 12.[3] He pursued formal musical education at Loyola School of Music while still in his youth, and later attended the Manhattan School of Music in New York, where he graduated on full scholarship.[4] His career has spanned decades, during which he has performed with legendary artists including Thelonious Monk, Dr. John, Chuck Mangione, BB King, and numerous other jazz and blues luminaries.[3][4]

Miller's professional trajectory reflects his deep commitment to jazz excellence and his role as both a performer and educator. He served as music director and arranger for Dr. John's band, contributing to many classic New Orleans R&B recordings.[3][4] Beyond his work with established artists, Miller has performed at prestigious venues including Carnegie Hall and on major television programs such as the Tonight Show with Jay Leno and Conan O'Brien.[4] He has also taught jazz combo at Loyola University, passing his knowledge to the next generation of musicians.[3] Throughout his career, Miller has released multiple solo albums including "Peace Horn," "Fonk Horn," "Prayer for New Orleans," "Christmas in New Orleans," and "Classic," showcasing his versatility across jazz, blues, and funk styles.[4]

Miller's legacy is rooted in his dedication to authentic jazz and blues traditions during an era when these genres were being commercialized. He has remained deeply connected to New Orleans, his birthplace, and continues to perform in the local music scene while maintaining his commitment to the pure, heartfelt expression that defined the golden age of jazz and R&B.[4]
