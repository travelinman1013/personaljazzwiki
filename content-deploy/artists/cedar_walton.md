## Biography
Cedar Anthony Walton Jr. (January 17, 1934 – August 19, 2013) was a renowned American jazz pianist, composer, and bandleader, celebrated for his contributions to the hard bop and post-bop idioms. Born and raised in Dallas, Texas, Walton was first taught piano by his mother, Ruth, an aspiring concert pianist, who exposed him to both classical and jazz traditions. He later studied music at the University of Denver, where he was introduced to leading jazz musicians such as Charlie Parker and John Coltrane during after-hours sessions, experiences that profoundly shaped his musical outlook.

In 1955, Walton moved to New York City, quickly gaining recognition in the city's vibrant jazz scene. He began his professional career working with artists like Lou Donaldson, Gigi Gryce, Sonny Rollins, and Kenny Dorham, before joining J.J. Johnson’s group. Walton's major breakthrough came as pianist and arranger for Art Blakey’s Jazz Messengers, where he contributed classic compositions such as 'Mosaic' and 'Ugetsu.' He later co-founded the influential group Eastern Rebellion and maintained a prolific recording and performing career, both as a leader and sought-after sideman. Walton’s style is marked by sophisticated harmonies, lyrical improvisation, and a deep rhythmic drive, and his compositions like 'Bolivia' and 'Holy Land' have become jazz standards.

Walton’s legacy endures through his extensive discography, his role in shaping the sound of modern jazz piano, and his influence on generations of musicians. He was named an NEA Jazz Master and is remembered as a gentle innovator whose work bridged bebop, hard bop, and beyond, leaving an indelible mark on the jazz tradition.
