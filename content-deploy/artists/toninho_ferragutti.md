## Biography
Toninho Ferragutti is a renowned Brazilian accordionist, composer, and arranger, widely regarded as one of the most important figures in modern Brazilian accordion music. Born in Socorro, in the countryside of São Paulo, Ferragutti was immersed in music from an early age, thanks to his father Pedro Ferragutti, a saxophonist and composer. His formative years were shaped by the vibrant local music scene, particularly the 'rodas de choro' (choro jam sessions), and he furthered his education at the Gomes Cardin Conservatory in Campinas, studying accordion with Dante D'Alonzo and harmony with Claudio Leal Ferreira. Although he initially pursued veterinary medicine at UNESP, he left academia in 1983 to dedicate himself fully to music, marking the beginning of a prolific professional career.[1][2][6]

Ferragutti's career is distinguished by his sophisticated blend of Brazilian popular music (MPB), jazz, classical, and folk genres such as choro, forró, gafieira, and chamamé. His innovative approach to the accordion has earned him critical acclaim, including Latin Grammy nominations for his albums 'Sanfonema' (2000) and 'Nem Sol, Nem Lua' (2006). He is celebrated for his dynamic performances and original compositions, which showcase a unique fusion of popular and classical elements, as well as free improvisation. Ferragutti has collaborated with a wide array of prominent artists, both Brazilian and international, and has contributed to numerous recordings, television shows, and soundtracks, solidifying his legacy as a versatile and influential musician.[1][3][6]

Beyond his solo work, Ferragutti has performed with major symphony orchestras and participated in prestigious jazz festivals across Europe and the United States. His artistry has enriched the repertoire of Brazilian music, and he continues to inspire new generations of musicians through his performances, collaborations, and dedication to the evolution of the accordion in contemporary music.[1][3][6]
