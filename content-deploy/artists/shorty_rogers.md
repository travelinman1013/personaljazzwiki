## Biography
Milton "Shorty" Rogers was born on April 14, 1924, in Great Barrington, Massachusetts, and grew up in the Bronx before becoming one of the principal architects of West Coast jazz.[1][2] He began his professional career at age eighteen with Will Bradley's band, followed by a stint with Red Norvo's sextet until being drafted into the Army in 1943.[4] After his discharge in 1945, Rogers joined Woody Herman's First Herd, where he began to gain recognition not only as a skilled trumpet and flugelhorn player but also as an innovative arranger, contributing arrangements for Herman's Woodchoppers on pieces like "Fan It" and "Nero's Conception."[4] He subsequently worked with Stan Kenton from 1950 to 1951, where his arranging talents were further developed and utilized.[2]

After relocating permanently to Los Angeles in 1947, Rogers established himself as a leading figure in the West Coast jazz scene.[5] In 1951, he formed a small group featuring Art Pepper, Shelley Manne, Jimmy Giuffre, and Hampton Hawes to record "Modern Sounds" for Capitol Records, an album whose tight and innovative arrangements are considered by many to be as influential as Gil Evans' work on Miles Davis' "Birth of the Cool."[1] Rogers became known for his bright, optimistic yet characteristically low-key trumpet style, and he was prolific in studio work, contributing arrangements and compositions across jazz, pop, and television projects.[3] His decision to focus on full-time studio work in 1962 marked a significant shift in his career, though he continued to work occasionally on recordings and arrangements throughout the 1960s and beyond.[3]

Rogers remained active in the jazz community into his later years, returning to performance in 1982 with Britain's National Youth Jazz Orchestra and subsequently forming the Lighthouse All Stars group with Bud Shank, Bill Perkins, and Bob Cooper in the 1990s.[1] He died on November 7, 1994, at age 70, leaving behind a legacy as one of West Coast jazz's most influential arrangers and a pioneer in the use of the flugelhorn in jazz.[1][2]

## Fun Facts
- Rogers was one of the earliest jazz musicians to adopt the flugelhorn as a primary instrument, helping to establish it as a standard jazz voice.[1]
- Marlon Brando wanted Rogers to provide the soundtrack for his film "The Wild One," but the studio refused and hired Leith Stevens instead; however, Rogers was featured on screen in Frank Sinatra's "The Man With the Golden Arm," leading the jazz group Sinatra's character performed with.[3]
- Rogers arranged the Monkees' 1967 #1 hit single "Daydream Believer," one of his most famous pop music contributions, demonstrating his versatility beyond jazz.[1]
- Rogers died during KLON's West Coast Jazz festival in 1994, bringing his life full circle within the jazz community he helped define.[1]
