## Biography
Timothy Tyler Childers, born June 21, 1991, in Lawrence County, Kentucky, near the West Virginia border, grew up in a close-knit Appalachian community where his father worked in the coal industry and his mother was a nurse. From an early age, he sang in his Free Will Baptist Church congregation, learned guitar chords from his grandfather, and began writing songs around age 13, drawing inspiration from classic rock, 1980s country artists like Hank Williams Jr., Ricky Skaggs, and Alabama, and later bluegrass after his grandfather's death when Childers was 15. He attended Paintsville High School, graduating in 2009, and briefly studied at Western Kentucky University and Bluegrass Community & Technical College before dropping out to pursue music full-time, performing in Lexington, Kentucky, and Huntington, West Virginia, with his early band the Food Stamps.[1][2][3][4]
