## Quick Info

## Biography
The Avalanches are an Australian electronic music group formed in Melbourne in 1997, pioneering the plunderphonics genre with their groundbreaking debut album Since I Left You (2000), which has been widely recognized by critics as the most important example of the genre. The group originated from Alarm 115, a noise punk outfit formed in 1994 by Robbie Chater, Tony Di Blasi, and Darren Seltmann, which evolved into The Avalanches as they shifted their musical direction toward electronic experimentation and sample-based composition. Over their career spanning more than two decades, the group has released three studio albums—Since I Left You (2000), Wildflower (2016), and We Will Always Love You (2020)—while also performing live and recorded DJ sets that showcase their innovative approach to electronic music production.

Blood Orange, the musical moniker of Devonté Hynes (born David Joseph Michael Hynes on December 23, 1985), is an English singer, songwriter, record producer, composer, and director based in New York City who has become a prominent figure in contemporary experimental pop and R&B. Before establishing himself as Blood Orange, Hynes was a member of the post-hardcore band Test Icicles from 2004 to 2006 and released two solo albums as Lightspeed Champion, showcasing his versatility across genres ranging from indie-folk to electronic music. Since launching the Blood Orange project in 2009, Hynes has released five studio albums between 2011 and 2025—Coastal Grooves (2011), Cupid Deluxe (2013), Freetown Sound (2016), Negro Swan (2018), and Essex Honey (2025)—establishing himself as a culturally engaged artist known for his tender, melodically rich sound that blends R&B, electronic music, and experimental pop while addressing themes of collective pain and social consciousness.

The Avalanches and Blood Orange collaborated on the single 'We Will Always Love You,' released on February 20, 2020, marking a significant connection between the Australian electronic pioneers and the London-born, New York-based producer-artist. This collaboration represents a meeting of two distinct but complementary approaches to electronic and experimental music, with The Avalanches' sample-based plunderphonics aesthetic intersecting with Blood Orange's emotionally nuanced, genre-blending production style.
