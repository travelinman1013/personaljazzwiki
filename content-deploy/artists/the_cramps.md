## Biography
The Cramps were an American rock band formed in 1976 by Lux Interior (Erick Lee Purkhiser) and Poison Ivy Rorschach (Kristy Marlana Wallace), a husband-and-wife duo who met in Sacramento, California, in 1972 and bonded over their shared love of obscure rock music, horror films, and the occult[1][3]. After moving through Ohio, they settled in New York City in 1975, immersing themselves in the burgeoning punk scene centered around CBGB, alongside acts like the Ramones, Patti Smith, and Blondie[1][4]. Their early lineup included Bryan Gregory on guitar and Pam Balam on drums, with frequent personnel changes over the years, but Lux and Ivy remained the band's core throughout its existence[1][4].

The Cramps pioneered the psychobilly genre, a fusion of punk rock and 1950s rockabilly, marked by distorted guitars, frenetic vocals, and a campy, horror-inspired aesthetic[1][2][3]. Their debut album, "Songs the Lord Taught Us" (1980), and subsequent releases like "Psychedelic Jungle" (1981) and "A Date With Elvis" (1986) showcased their unique style, which drew heavily on B-movie imagery, drag culture, and retro sounds[2][3]. The band became infamous for their wild live performances, including a legendary show at Napa State Mental Hospital, and for Lux Interior's provocative stage presence[2][3].

Despite frequent lineup changes and periods of recording hiatus, The Cramps maintained a devoted cult following and toured internationally, especially in Europe. Their influence extended across punk, goth, and alternative scenes, and they are credited with reviving interest in camp, drag, and 1950s rock 'n' roll. The band disbanded after Lux Interior's death in 2009, leaving a lasting legacy as one of the most distinctive and influential acts in underground music[1][3][7].

- The band initially had no bass player, which contributed to their distinctive, guitar-heavy sound[2][4].
