## Biography
Leci Brandão was born on September 12, 1944, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, specifically in the neighborhood of Madureira and raised in Vila Isabel. She emerged as one of the torchbearers of the modern samba revival, establishing herself as a traditionalist whose roots trace back to the pagode scene of the 1970s. Her breakthrough came when she won the National Meeting of Samba Composers in 1973 with her performance of "Quero Sim," and her debut album was released in 1974. As a self-taught singer and percussionist, she made history by becoming the first woman invited to Mangueira's Ala dos Compositores (composer's section) in 1974, a significant achievement in the male-dominated samba world.

Throughout her five-decade career, Brandão developed a distinctive musical style characterized by crisp, youthful vocals with direct populist appeal, drawing comparisons to samba legends like Alcione and Clara Nunes. Her compositions often addressed themes of love, Blackness, oppression, and spirituality (orixás), consistently weaving social critique into her work. She recorded dozens of albums and won the Brazilian Music Award multiple times. Beyond her musical achievements, Brandão became a prominent television personality in the 1980s, serving as a commentator for Brazil's TV coverage of famous samba school carnival parades, and later transitioned into politics, joining the Communist Party of Brazil in 2010 and becoming a State Representative for São Paulo, making history as the first Black woman to serve four consecutive terms in the state legislature.

As a Black Brazilian woman and openly gay artist since her 1978 coming-out interview, Brandão has consistently used her platform to speak against racism, homophobia, and all forms of discrimination. She performed in LGBT events and was honored by the Escola de samba Académicos del Tatuapé during the 2012 carnival. Her legacy extends beyond music into activism and political representation, and as she celebrated her 80th birthday in 2024, she remained active in public life, continuing to advocate for social justice and celebrating the contributions of Black women in samba and Brazilian culture.
