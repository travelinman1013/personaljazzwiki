## Biography
Michael Eugene Archer, professionally known as D'Angelo, was born on February 11, 1974, in Richmond, Virginia, USA. Raised in a Pentecostal household, he was deeply influenced by gospel music from a young age, first captivated by the piano as a child after watching his brother play[2]. By age 16, he had formed his first band, Michael Archer and Precise, and began writing original songs, eventually winning Amateur Night at Harlem's Apollo Theater three times, which helped launch his career[3].

D'Angelo emerged as a leading figure in the neo-soul movement with his debut album 'Brown Sugar' in 1995, blending vintage 1970s R&B and hip-hop influences with contemporary soul and funk[1][2]. The album's success, including hits like 'Brown Sugar,' 'Cruisin',' and 'Lady,' established him as a fresh voice in R&B and earned him platinum certification and critical acclaim. His follow-up, 'Voodoo' (2000), debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and was lauded for its complex musicality and innovative fusion of genres. The album featured collaborations with artists such as Method Man and Redman, and its single 'Untitled (How Does It Feel)' won two Grammy Awards[2].

Over his career, D'Angelo became known for his rich, soulful vocals, multi-instrumental talents, and genre-defying style, drawing comparisons to Prince and influencing a generation of artists. Despite a lengthy hiatus due to personal struggles, including a near-fatal car accident and battles with addiction[2], his legacy as a pioneer of neo-soul and a transformative force in modern R&B remains widely recognized. In 2025, he was inducted into the National Rhythm & Blues Hall of Fame, cementing his status among the greatest R&B artists of all time[1].
