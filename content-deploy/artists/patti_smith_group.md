## Biography
The Patti Smith Group emerged from the vibrant New York City arts and music scene of the early 1970s, led by poet, singer, and songwriter Patti Smith. Born in Chicago in 1946 and raised in New Jersey, Smith moved to New York in 1967, where she became deeply involved in the East Village’s avant-garde community. Initially performing poetry with musical accompaniment, Smith’s collaboration with guitarist and rock journalist Lenny Kaye evolved into a full band by 1974, with the addition of Richard Sohl (piano), Ivan Král (guitar/bass), and Jay Dee Daugherty (drums). Their debut single, "Hey Joe/Piss Factory," released in 1974, combined Smith’s spoken word with rock, signaling a new direction in punk and proto-punk music.[1][3][5]

The group’s breakthrough came with their 1975 debut album, "Horses," produced by John Cale of the Velvet Underground. The album’s raw energy, poetic lyrics, and minimalist arrangements were groundbreaking, influencing the burgeoning punk movement in both the US and UK. The Patti Smith Group became a fixture at CBGB, the legendary New York club, and their subsequent albums—"Radio Ethiopia" (1976), "Easter" (1978, featuring the hit "Because the Night" co-written with Bruce Springsteen), and "Wave" (1979)—cemented their reputation for blending rock, poetry, and political consciousness. Smith’s charismatic stage presence and visionary texts attracted a devoted following and helped redefine the role of women in rock.[1][4][5]

After the group disbanded in 1979, Smith temporarily withdrew from public life, but the legacy of the Patti Smith Group endures. Their pioneering fusion of poetry and rock, as well as their influence on punk, alternative, and indie music, has been widely recognized. Smith’s later solo work and activism further solidified her status as a cultural icon, and the group’s music continues to inspire new generations of artists.[1][4][6]
