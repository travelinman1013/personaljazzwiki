## Biography
Percy Sledge was born on November 25, 1940, in Leighton, Alabama, a small rural town in the Tennessee Valley. Raised in a working-class, agricultural environment, Sledge began singing in the Galilee Missionary Baptist Church and was influenced by the country and western music he heard on Grand Ole Opry radio broadcasts. Before his music career, he worked as a hospital orderly and sang with local gospel and R&B groups, including the Esquires, often delighting patients and staff with his soulful voice.

Sledge's big break came when a hospital patient introduced him to local producer Quin Ivy, who signed him after hearing his audition. In 1966, Sledge recorded 'When a Man Loves a Woman' at Norala Studios in Sheffield, Alabama—a song that became an instant classic, reaching number one on the charts and earning Atlantic Records its first gold record. Sledge followed this with a string of Southern soul hits such as 'Warm and Tender Love,' 'It Tears Me Up,' and 'Take Time to Know Her,' working closely with Muscle Shoals songwriters and musicians. His emotive, keening vocal style, blending gospel, soul, and country influences, became a hallmark of the Muscle Shoals sound.

Though Sledge never again matched the commercial peak of his debut, he maintained a steady career, touring internationally and recording into the 1970s and beyond. His music resonated across racial lines, even in apartheid-era South Africa, and he was recognized with induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2005. Sledge's legacy endures as one of the most expressive and influential voices in classic soul and country-soul music.
