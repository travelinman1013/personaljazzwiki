## Biography
Arthur "Blind" Blake, often celebrated as the "King of Ragtime Guitar," was born in Newport News, Virginia, likely in 1896, to Winter and Alice Blake, though definitive records are scarce[1][3][4]. Blind from birth or early childhood, Blake faced the considerable challenges of living with a disability in early 20th-century America. He spent his formative years as a traveling musician, busking on street corners and performing in minstrel and medicine shows throughout the South and Southeast, with Jacksonville, Florida, serving as a key hub for his artistry[1][2][4].

Blake's prodigious guitar skills, characterized by intricate fingerpicking, syncopated rhythms, and a ragtime dance style, caught the attention of Paramount Records in the mid-1920s. Between 1926 and 1932, he recorded nearly 80 sides, including classics like "West Coast Blues," "Southern Rag," and "Police Dog Blues," which showcased his technical mastery and charismatic personality[1][2][7]. Blake's music blended humour, poignant storytelling, and dazzling guitar work, making him a sought-after session musician and a prolific solo artist in Chicago's vibrant Bronzeville neighborhood[4][7].

Despite his commercial success, Blake's life ended tragically. The collapse of Paramount Records and the economic devastation of the Great Depression left him unemployed. He settled in Milwaukee with his wife, Beatrice, and died of tuberculosis in 1934 at the age of 38, leaving behind a legacy that profoundly shaped American blues and ragtime guitar[1][3][4][5].
