## Biography
Wayne 'The Train' Hancock, born Thomas Wayne Hancock III on May 1, 1965, in Dallas, Texas, is a celebrated American singer-songwriter renowned for his authentic blend of honky tonk, western swing, rockabilly, and Americana. Growing up in a family that moved frequently due to his father's engineering career, Hancock was exposed to a rich array of classic country and swing records from an early age, including those by Jimmie Rodgers, Hank Williams, and Glenn Miller. He began writing songs at twelve and, at eighteen, won the Wrangler Country Showdown contest before serving four years in the U.S. Marine Corps, during which he wrote some of his early signature songs, such as 'Cold Lonesome Wind.'[1][2][6]

After his military service, Hancock settled in Austin, Texas, where he quickly became a fixture in the local music scene. His breakthrough came with the 1995 release of 'Thunderstorms and Neon Signs,' produced by Lloyd Maines, which established him as a leading figure in what he calls 'juke joint swing'—a vibrant fusion of honky tonk, western swing, blues, and rockabilly. Hancock's music is noted for its raw, energetic performances and refusal to conform to Nashville's commercial country trends, earning him a loyal underground following and critical acclaim for his sincerity and roots-driven style.[1][2][3][4]

Hancock's legacy lies in his unwavering commitment to traditional American music forms, revitalizing them with youthful energy and originality. His marathon live shows, often lasting several hours, and his dedication to touring have cemented his reputation as one of the hardest-working and most genuine artists in contemporary roots music. He is frequently cited as a key influence by younger generations of country and rockabilly musicians, and his work continues to inspire both peers and fans alike.[2][3][4]
