## Biography
Clap! Clap! is the stage name of Italian producer, DJ, and long‑time jazz musician Cristiano Crisci, born in 1981 and raised in Florence, Italy.[1][8] He first emerged in the mid‑1990s as a teenager performing as a rapper with one of the early pop crews in Florence before shifting his focus to the saxophone and playing jazz standards in clubs across Tuscany.[1][3] Through the early 2000s he moved restlessly between genres, joining the punk/jazz trio Trio Cane—built around double bass, sax, and drums—and later the electronic trio A Smile For Timbuctu, with which he frequently performed in London around 2003–2004.[1][3] These experiences laid the groundwork for his first solo electronic project, Digi G’Alessio, launched in 2008 and informed by the hip‑hop and experimental beat scenes.[1][3]

Under the Digi G’Alessio moniker Crisci began to explore heavy sampling, including early work like *The Rain Book*, which drew on recordings of Ghanaian and Guinean tribes, a conceptual direction he later refined into the project that became Clap! Clap! around 2013.[1][2] As Clap! Clap! he forged a distinctive sound that fuses field recordings, traditional and tribal music from across the globe (notably African and Italian folk sources), Chicago footwork and club rhythms, and the harmonic sensibility of a trained jazz musician, often framed within strong narrative or conceptual structures.[1][3][5] His debut full‑length *Tayi Bebba* (Black Acre, 2014) presented a tour of an imagined island where each track depicts a location, ritual, or event, followed by *A Thousand Skies*—anchored by the story of a young girl’s journey through the stars—and *Liquid Portraits*, which further developed his interest in sound research, nature, and global folkloric material.[1][5][7] Recognized internationally as one of Italy’s most adventurous electronic producers, he has drawn the admiration of tastemakers and artists such as Annie Mac, Diplo, Toddla T, Skream, and Paul Simon, who praised his work for making music sound both new and ancient at once.[1][5]

Beyond club contexts, Clap! Clap!’s music is notable for its meticulous sound research and its bridging of tradition and futurism: he often builds tracks from tribal and folk samples, field recordings, and environmental sounds, then recomposes them with intricate, jazz‑informed drum programming and modern bass‑music production.[1][3][5][7] His live performances across Europe and Japan translate this hybrid into high‑energy sets that emphasize polyrhythmic percussion and global textures while remaining strongly melodic and emotionally driven.[1] Over more than a decade, Crisci has helped expand the language of electronic club music by treating folklore and everyday sound as raw compositional material, positioning Clap! Clap! as a key figure in the contemporary intersection of jazz sensibility, global music research, and forward‑thinking dancefloor production.[1][3][5][7]

## Fun Facts
- Clap! Clap! originally started as a side experiment while Crisci was finishing his *Ivory* EP for Lucky Beard Records—he casually combined electronic drums with samples of central African tribes for fun, then was so impressed by the result that he built an entire new project around this idea.[3]
- Before his international electronic career, Crisci was part of the Florence crew 3CK, one of the first local pop crews, where he performed as a singer/rapper at the beginning of the 2000s.[3]
- The conceptual debut album *Tayi Bebba* is set on a completely imagined island, with each track representing a specific place, ritual, or event on that island, effectively turning the record into a sonic travelogue.[1]
- Paul Simon publicly praised Clap! Clap!’s work in Rolling Stone, calling his album a “masterpiece” and highlighting how it makes music sound both new and old at the same time, an unusual endorsement from a major songwriter for an underground electronic producer.[1]

## Musical Connections

### Mentors/Influences
- [[traditional_jazz_repertoire_and_club_bandleaders_in_tuscany|Traditional jazz repertoire and club bandleaders in Tuscany]] - Crisci cites his formative years playing standard jazz in clubs across Tuscany as essential training in improvisation, harmony, and ensemble playing, shaping the jazz foundation that underpins his later electronic work. (Live performances of jazz standards in Tuscan clubs prior to his electronic projects) [Early 2000s[3]]
- [[punk_and_hardcore_underground_scenes|Punk and hardcore underground scenes]] - His period in the punk/hardcore trio Trio Cane exposed him to high‑energy, DIY aesthetics and unconventional line‑ups, elements that later informed the intensity and rhythmic drive of Clap! Clap! material. (Performances and recordings with Trio Cane (double bass, sax, drums)) [Early 2000s[1][3]]
- [[central_and_west_african_tribal_music|Central and West African tribal music]] - Crisci’s early solo work as Digi G’Alessio experimented with sampling tribes from Ghana and Guinea, and he later deepened this research for Clap! Clap!, using African tribal and folk materials as core sonic and conceptual influences. (Digi G’Alessio’s *The Rain Book*; later Clap! Clap! releases drawing on African tribal samples) [Late 2000s onward[2][3]]

### Artists Influenced
- [[producers_in_global_bass_and_experimental_club_music_various|Producers in global bass and experimental club music (various)]] - While individual names are rarely documented, Clap! Clap!’s fusion of African and global folk samples with footwork and bass‑music structures has been widely cited in coverage as pushing the sound of contemporary club music and inspiring producers interested in combining folkloric material, field recordings, and narrative concepts with dancefloor forms. (Subsequent global‑bass, footwork, and experimental club releases that adopt similar approaches to tribal sampling and narrative album concepts, following *Tayi Bebba* and *A Thousand Skies*.) [Mid‑2010s onward (inferred from critical reception and scene evolution)[1][5][7]]
