## Biography
Jerk were an Australian industrial metal band formed in 1998 in Sydney, emerging from the city's underground music scene as an industrial goth rock outfit. The band's original lineup consisted of vocalist Michael Matral, drummer Lamar Lowder, guitarist Johnathan Devoy, and bass player Ross Empson. The group underwent significant lineup changes in June 2000, with Devoy transitioning to lead vocals while Lowder remained on drums, joined by guitarist Charles Cilia and bassist Leeno Dee (formerly of Candy Harlots). This stable four-piece configuration would define the band's most productive period and record their sole full-length album.

In 2003, Jerk released their landmark album 'When Pure Is Defiled,' co-produced by Sean Beavan and Lamar Lowder. The album achieved notable commercial success on the Australian charts, reaching No. 38 on the ARIA Albums Chart, No. 8 on the ARIA Australasian Artists Albums chart, and No. 6 on the ARIA Heavy Rock & Metal Albums charts. The band gained international exposure when their track 'Sucked In' was featured in the video games 'Need for Speed: Underground' and 'NHL 2004.' During 2003, Jerk embarked on a national promotional tour, securing support slots for major international acts including Marilyn Manson, Insane Clown Posse, Killing Joke, and Disturbed at various Australian dates.

Despite their momentum, Jerk's tenure proved brief. Vocalist Johnathan Devoy stepped down in early 2004 and was replaced by Mario Spate, but the band dissolved by the end of that year. The members pursued separate musical directions: Lamar Lowder continued as a music producer and songwriter, while Cilia, Dee, and Devoy reunited in January 2006 to form Ink, a band that abandoned the industrial sound in favor of a different aesthetic. The trio reunited for a one-off acoustic Jerk performance on July 21, 2013, marking a brief return to their industrial roots.
