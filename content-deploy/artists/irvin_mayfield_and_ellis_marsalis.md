## Biography
Irvin Mayfield Jr., born December 23, 1977, in New Orleans, Louisiana, emerged as a prominent jazz trumpeter, composer, bandleader, and educator deeply rooted in the city's musical heritage. Turning down a scholarship to Juilliard, he studied at the University of New Orleans Jazz Studies program under the mentorship of pianist Ellis Marsalis, though he later dropped out after the first semester. Influenced by trumpet legends like Louis Armstrong, Miles Davis, Clifford Brown, and Dizzy Gillespie, Mayfield's style blends traditional New Orleans jazz with Afro-Cuban elements, bebop, and modern improvisation, viewing jazz as a manifestation of American democracy and the soul of his hometown.[1][3][4][7]

In 1998, Mayfield co-founded the Afro-Cuban jazz band Los Hombres Calientes with drummer Jason Marsalis and percussionist Bill Summers, signing with Basin Street Records and releasing multiple albums that appealed to diverse audiences through danceable rhythms fused with jazz and R&B. He founded the New Orleans Jazz Orchestra (NOJO) in 2002 as a nonprofit to promote local jazz, serving as artistic director until 2016, and composed works like the Elysian Fields Jazz Suite exploring themes of liberty, family, and rebirth. Notable releases include the 2008 album Love Songs, Ballads and Standards with Ellis Marsalis and his sextet, and 2011's A Love Letter to New Orleans, chronicling his bond with the city's jazz legacy. Mayfield has performed at venues like Carnegie Hall and festivals worldwide.[1][3][4]

Recognized as one of the most recorded and decorated jazz musicians of his generation, Mayfield has been a cultural ambassador for New Orleans, founding the Institute of Jazz Culture at Dillard University and engaging in civic life inspired by his mentors. His work with Ellis Marsalis highlights a collaborative effort to preserve and evolve the New Orleans jazz tradition.[1][3]
