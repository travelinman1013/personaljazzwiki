## Biography
Austin Taylor, known professionally as Ted Taylor, was born on February 16, 1934, in Okmulgee, Oklahoma. Growing up in Oklahoma, Taylor was primarily exposed to Country and Gospel music, with R.H. Harris, the original lead vocalist of the Soul Stirrers, serving as a particularly strong influence on his vocal style. In 1952, at age 18, Taylor moved to California where he joined the Santa Monica Soul Seekers, a group that would soon transform into the well-known doo-wop ensemble The Cadets (also known as The Jacks). From 1955 to 1957, Taylor performed with The Cadets on the Modern and RPM labels, achieving significant commercial success with hits like "Why Don't You Write Me" and "Stranded In The Jungle."

In 1958, Taylor embarked on a solo career that would span nearly three decades and traverse multiple musical eras including the golden age of soul, 1970s funk, disco, and the 1980s blues revival circuit. His distinctive vocal style featured extreme falsetto, frequent vibrato, and dramatic emotional range that reflected his country and gospel roots. Taylor recorded his first version of "Be Ever Wonderful" at Duke Records in 1959, which became one of his signature songs. Throughout the 1960s, he recorded for Okeh Records, charting with songs like "Stay Away from My Baby" (reaching #14 R&B and #99 US in 1965). In 1969, he signed with Ronn Records, releasing three albums and continuing to place songs on the R&B charts, including "It's Too Late" (#30 R&B, 1969) and "Something Strange Is Goin' On in My House" (#26 R&B, 1970). Later in his career, he recorded for labels including Alarm and Solpugits in the mid-1970s.

Despite his remarkable vocal talent and consistent output, Taylor remained chronically underappreciated during his lifetime, finding his strongest audience among Southern Black communities where his records were staples on jukeboxes in lounges and juke joints throughout the region. His unique combination of deep soul intensity and soaring falsetto made him a master of both uptempo material and slow dance ballads. Taylor passed away on October 23, 1987, leaving behind a legacy as one of soul music's most distinctive yet overlooked voices, embodying the classic northern soul, soul blues, and deep southern soul traditions.

## Fun Facts

- Despite having a fairly large hit with "Be Ever Wonderful" and placing multiple songs on the R&B charts throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Taylor remained so unknown that even serious record collectors in later decades were often unfamiliar with his work.
- Taylor's career spanned an remarkable range of musical eras and styles over three decades: from childhood gospel and teenage doo-wop in the 1950s, through the golden age of soul in the 1960s, into 1970s funk and disco, and finally the 1980s blues revival circuit.
- His recordings from 1958 to 1966 were compiled on a 1985 album titled "Somebody's Always Trying" released by Mr. R&B Records, preserving some of his most killer early solo work.
