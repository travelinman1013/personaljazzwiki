## Biography
The Radiators, often referred to as the New Orleans Radiators, are a seminal roots rock band formed in 1978 in New Orleans, Louisiana. The group originated from informal jam sessions in keyboardist Ed Volker’s garage, bringing together musicians from two local bands: Ed Volker, Frank Bua Jr., and Camile Baudoin from Rhapsodizers, and Dave Malone and Reggie Scanlan from Roadapple. Their chemistry was immediate, and the members quickly committed to the new project, quitting their previous bands to focus on The Radiators full-time[2][4][5].

The band became a cornerstone of the New Orleans music scene, helping to revive local venues and festivals such as the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival and Tipitina’s. Their sound, dubbed “Fish Head Music,” is a rich blend of blues, R&B, jazz, country, zydeco, soul, swing, and gospel, all filtered through the lens of New Orleans rock and roll[5][6]. The Radiators are known for their energetic live performances and extensive touring, which helped them build a devoted fanbase. Over more than four decades, they have played with and backed up legends like Professor Longhair, Jessie Hill, Ernie K-Doe, and Earl King, further cementing their legacy as one of the city’s most influential bands[2][4][5].

Their longevity and eclectic style have made them a vital link between generations of New Orleans musicians, and their “Fish Head Music” continues to inspire both fans and fellow artists. The Radiators’ contribution to the city’s musical heritage is celebrated through their induction into the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame and their enduring presence on the local and national touring circuit[5][6].
