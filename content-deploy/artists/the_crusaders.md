## Biography
The Crusaders, originally known as The Jazz Crusaders, were an American jazz fusion group that originated in Houston, Texas, in the early 1950s. The nucleus of the band—drummer Nesbert 'Stix' Hooper, pianist Joe Sample, saxophonist and bassist Wilton Felder, and trombonist Wayne Henderson—began playing together as high school students at Smith Junior High School, Phyllis Wheatley High School, and Texas Southern University. Initially forming as The Swingsters in 1954, they played a mix of jazz, blues, and rhythm and blues, blending various musical influences into what they later called the 'Gulf Coast sound.' After relocating to Los Angeles in 1958 and performing as The Nite Hawks in Las Vegas, they secured a recording contract with Pacific Jazz Records in 1961 and renamed themselves The Jazz Crusaders, releasing their acclaimed debut album 'Freedom Sound' that same year.[1][3]

As The Jazz Crusaders, the group recorded nineteen albums from 1961 to 1970, establishing themselves as leading exponents of hard bop with strong R&B and soul influences. In 1970, they took a break from recording and reemerged with a new name—simply The Crusaders—and a revolutionary electrified jazz-funk sound, featuring Sample on electric piano, Larry Carlton on electric guitar, and Robert 'Pops' Popwell on electric bass.[1] Their albums in the 1970s appeared regularly on both jazz and pop charts, and in 1975 they became the first and only instrumental group to tour with rock legends The Rolling Stones. Their most successful album, 'Street Life' (1979), reached the Top 20 on the Billboard jazz, pop, and black album charts, with the title track featuring vocalist Randy Crawford reaching the Top 40 pop singles chart.[1]

The group experienced significant personnel changes throughout their career, with founding member Wayne Henderson departing in 1975 to pursue production work, and drummer Stix Hooper leaving in 1983, leaving Sample and Felder as the last remaining founding members. The Crusaders received nine Grammy nominations throughout their career and continued performing into the 2010s, finally disbanding in 1991 before occasional reunions.[1][2] Their legacy encompasses a unique fusion of hard bop, soul, R&B, and funk that influenced the development of jazz fusion and smooth jazz genres.

## Fun Facts
- In 1975, The Crusaders became the first and only instrumental group to tour with The Rolling Stones, a remarkable achievement that demonstrated their crossover appeal beyond the jazz audience.[1]
- The band went through five different names throughout their history: The Swingsters (1954), The Modern Jazz Sextet, The Nite Hawks, The Jazz Crusaders (1961), and finally The Crusaders (1971), reflecting their evolving musical direction and commercial strategy.[3]
- Their debut album 'Freedom Sound' (1961) was recorded in a single day at Pacific Studios on May 24, 1961, yet it became a landmark recording that encapsulated their fresh sound of powerful instrumental virtuosity, R&B-influenced melodics, and groove.[3]
- The group experienced remarkable longevity, performing together for nearly 50 years from the 1960s to the 2010s, with Joe Sample and Wilton Felder remaining as the last two founding members until the band's dissolution.[2]
