## Biography
Ahmed Abdul-Malik, born Jonathan Timms on January 30, 1927, in Brooklyn, New York, was a pioneering American jazz bassist and oud player whose work bridged the worlds of jazz and Middle Eastern music. Of Sudanese heritage, Abdul-Malik began his professional career as a bassist while still in high school in the mid-1940s, quickly becoming a fixture in New York’s vibrant bebop scene. Fluent in Arabic and deeply influenced by the music of the Arab world, he was among the first to experiment with integrating non-Western instruments—most notably the oud—into jazz, a bold move that set him apart from his contemporaries.[1][2][3][4]

Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, Abdul-Malik played with some of the era’s most influential jazz musicians, including Art Blakey, Thelonious Monk, John Coltrane, and Randy Weston. His own recordings as a bandleader, such as 'Jazz Sahara' (1958) and 'East Meets West' (1960), were groundbreaking in their synthesis of jazz improvisation with Middle Eastern and North African modes and rhythms. His music was visionary, foreshadowing later developments in world music and jazz fusion. Despite his innovations, Abdul-Malik’s work was often overlooked by the mainstream, and after the mid-1960s, he increasingly turned to teaching, eventually joining the faculty at New York University and Brooklyn College, where he influenced a new generation of musicians.[1][2][3][5]

Abdul-Malik’s legacy lies in his fearless cross-cultural experimentation and his role as a catalyst for some of jazz’s most radical departures. He remained active as an educator and performer until suffering a stroke in the 1980s, and continued his own studies with oud master Simon Shaheen until his death in Long Branch, New Jersey, on October 2, 1993. Today, his recordings are recognized as milestones in the history of jazz and world music.[1][2][4]
