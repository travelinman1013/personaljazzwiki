## Biography
Janis Lyn Joplin was born on January 19, 1943, in Port Arthur, Texas, to Seth Joplin, a mechanical engineer and Texaco worker, and Dorothy East Joplin, a registrar at a business college. The eldest of three children, she faced social ostracism in high school due to acne, weight gain, her tomboyish nature, and unconventional interests in blues, folk music, and beat poetry, inspired by artists like Lead Belly, Bessie Smith, Ma Rainey, Odetta, and Big Mama Thornton. A self-described misfit, Joplin sang in her church choir, painted, and performed blues and folk with friends, graduating from Thomas Jefferson High School in 1960 before briefly attending colleges like Lamar State College of Technology, Port Arthur College, and the University of Texas at Austin without graduating.[1][2][3][4][5][6][8]

In 1963, Joplin hitchhiked to San Francisco's North Beach and Haight-Ashbury scenes, immersing herself in the beatnik and hippie cultures, experimenting with drugs, and recording early folk tracks with guitarist Jorma Kaukonen. Returning briefly to Texas for a 'straight' life, she rejoined the San Francisco scene in 1966 at the invitation of promoter Chet Helms, becoming the lead singer of the psychedelic rock band Big Brother and the Holding Company. Her raw, blues-infused vocals—marked by growls, wails, and emotional intensity—exploded at the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival, propelling the band's success with their debut album and the million-selling Cheap Thrills (1968), featuring hits like 'Piece of My Heart.' She later pursued a solo career with the Kozmic Blues Band and Full Tilt Boogie Band, releasing I Got Dem Ol' Kozmic Blues Again Mama! (1969) and preparing Pearl (1971, posthumous), blending blues, acid rock, psychedelic rock, and soul.[2][3][5][6]

Joplin died of an accidental heroin overdose on October 4, 1970, in Hollywood, California, at age 27, cementing her as a rock icon. Her legacy endures as a pioneering female rock performer who shattered gender barriers with her fierce, uninhibited style, influencing generations and earning posthumous honors like Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction in 1995. Her authentic expression of pain, rebellion, and passion continues to resonate in classic rock.[3][5][6]

## Fun Facts
- Joplin recorded her first song, 'What Good Can Drinkin' Do,' on tape in December 1962 at a University of Texas student's home.[5]
- In early San Francisco, she recorded folk songs with future Jefferson Airplane guitarist Jorma Kaukonen, accompanied by his wife on typewriter beat.[2]
- She briefly lived a 'straight' life in Texas with a beehive hairdo, enrolling in sociology at Lamar University before returning to music.[2]
- Joplin was nicknamed a 'ballsy, tough-talking girl' in high school for her outrageous behavior and love of blues in local bars.[3]
