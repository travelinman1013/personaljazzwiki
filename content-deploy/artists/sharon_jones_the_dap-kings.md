# Sharon Jones, The Dap-Kings

## Biography
Sharon Jones was born in Augusta, Georgia, but mostly raised in Brooklyn, New York, where she spent childhood summers back in her birthplace and sang gospel in churches throughout her life, including leading the choir at the Universal Church of God. In the 1970s, she joined local funk bands but struggled to break into the recording industry, leading her to sing in wedding bands while working demanding jobs such as an armored car guard for Wells Fargo and a corrections officer at Rikers Island prison. Her powerful voice, often compared to James Brown, drew attention in 1996 when she provided backup vocals on a Lee Fields session produced by Gabriel Roth (Bosco Mann), who then featured her as lead on her first recording, 'Damn It's Hot,' at age 40.[1][2][3]

## Fun Facts

- The band's debut album Dap Dippin' was recorded in a Brooklyn basement and initially pressed in limited copies to fund a 20-show residency in Barcelona.[2]
- Despite her 2016 pancreatic cancer diagnosis, Jones completed recording Soul of a Woman, released posthumously in 2017, showcasing her voice at full power.[1]
- She was the subject of the acclaimed documentary Miss Sharon Jones! directed by Oscar-winner Barbara Kopple.[1]
