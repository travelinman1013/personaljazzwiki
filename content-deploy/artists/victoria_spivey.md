## Biography
Victoria Regina Spivey (October 15, 1906 – October 3, 1976) was a pioneering American blues singer, songwriter, and record label founder whose career spanned four decades. Born in Houston, Texas, into a musical family, Spivey began performing as a child in her father's string band and later accompanied silent films as a pianist in Dallas. By her teens, she was performing in Houston and Galveston clubs, often with blues luminaries like Blind Lemon Jefferson. In 1926, Spivey moved to St. Louis, where her debut recording, 'Black Snake Blues,' became a hit and launched her into the national spotlight. She recorded prolifically for labels such as OKeh, Victor, Vocalion, and Decca, and her songwriting was noted for its frank, sometimes risqué, and emotionally raw lyrics.

Spivey's musical style blended classic blues, ragtime, and country blues, characterized by her distinctive, nasal vocal delivery and fearless approach to taboo subjects. She performed in vaudeville, nightclubs, and musical revues, and appeared in the historic all-Black film 'Hallelujah!' (1929). Throughout her career, she collaborated with leading jazz and blues figures, including Louis Armstrong, King Oliver, Lonnie Johnson, and later, Bob Dylan. In the 1960s, Spivey co-founded Spivey Records with Len Kunstadt, providing a platform for both established and emerging blues artists. Her influence extended well beyond her recordings, as she mentored younger musicians and championed the blues tradition until her death in New York City in 1976.

Spivey's legacy is that of a trailblazer who helped shape the sound and business of blues music. She was celebrated not only for her artistry but also for her entrepreneurial spirit, resilience, and commitment to preserving and advancing the blues. Her work inspired generations of musicians and remains a touchstone for classic blues enthusiasts.
