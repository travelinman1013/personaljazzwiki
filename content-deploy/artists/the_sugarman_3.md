## Biography
The Sugarman 3, sometimes styled as The Sugarman Three, is a retro-funk and soul-jazz band formed in New York City in 1996 by tenor saxophonist Neal Sugarman. Sugarman, originally from the suburbs of Boston, developed his musical foundation at Berklee College of Music before immersing himself in the New York jazz scene and later spending formative years gigging in New Orleans. His experiences in these vibrant musical communities shaped his desire to create music that was both soulful and danceable, steering away from the more academic side of jazz.

Upon returning to New York in the mid-1990s, Sugarman assembled a trio with organist Adam Scone and drummer Rudy Albin, both of whom brought deep roots in soul and jazz. The group quickly became known for their energetic live performances and authentic throwback sound, which drew inspiration from classic soul-jazz and boogaloo. Their debut album, 'Sugar’s Boogaloo,' released in 1998 on Desco Records, was met with critical acclaim and established them as leaders in the modern funk revival. Subsequent albums like 'Soul Donkey' and 'Pure Cane Sugar' further cemented their reputation, and their partnership with Gabe Roth led to the founding of Daptone Records in 2002, a label that would become central to the soul revival movement.

The Sugarman 3’s music is characterized by its grooving Hammond organ, punchy saxophone lines, and tight rhythm section, blending elements of 1960s soul, funk, and jazz. Their sound avoids clichés, focusing instead on raw, dancefloor-friendly grooves. The group’s legacy is closely tied to the resurgence of vintage soul and funk in the 21st century, and they have played a pivotal role in launching the careers of other artists within the Daptone family.

## Fun Facts
- The Sugarman 3’s debut album, 'Sugar’s Boogaloo,' was so convincing in its retro style that many listeners initially believed it was a lost classic from the 1960s.

- The group’s music has been widely sampled and licensed for use in film, television, and advertising, thanks in part to its authentic vintage sound.
- Drummer Rudy Albin’s background includes playing with legendary jazz and soul artists, bringing deep authenticity to the group’s rhythm section.
