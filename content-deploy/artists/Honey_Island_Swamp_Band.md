## Biography
Honey Island Swamp Band is a New Orleans-based roots ensemble that emerged in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The founding members—Aaron Wilkinson (acoustic guitar, mandolin, vocals), Chris Mulé (electric guitar, vocals), Sam Price (bass, vocals), and Garland Paul (drums, vocals)—were all New Orleans musicians who found themselves displaced in San Francisco after the storm. Their chance meeting at the Boom Boom Room on Fillmore Street led to the formation of the band, named after the Honey Island Swamp near the Louisiana-Mississippi border. Drawing on their shared experiences and longing for home, they began performing together, quickly developing a unique sound that blended blues, soul, country, R&B, and the unmistakable rhythms of New Orleans, a style often described as 'Bayou Americana.'

The band’s early years were marked by resilience and creative growth. Within months of forming, they recorded their debut EP at the legendary Record Plant studios in Sausalito, California. Upon returning to New Orleans in 2007, Honey Island Swamp Band solidified their reputation as a powerhouse live act, releasing acclaimed albums such as 'Wishing Well' (2009) and 'Good To You' (2010). Their music is characterized by rich vocal harmonies, dynamic songwriting, and an organic fusion of American roots genres. Over the years, the band has expanded its lineup (notably adding keyboardist Trevor Brooks in 2010), toured extensively across the United States and internationally, and garnered multiple New Orleans music awards. They have become a staple of the contemporary roots scene, celebrated for both their studio recordings and energetic live performances.
