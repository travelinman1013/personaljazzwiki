## Biography
Layla Musselwhite is a New Orleans-based blues singer-songwriter and slide guitarist, known for her deep connection to the roots of American blues music. As the daughter of blues legend Charlie Musselwhite, Layla grew up immersed in the world of blues, touring with her father and absorbing the sounds of iconic artists such as Muddy Waters, Howlin’ Wolf, and John Lee Hooker. Her early life was shaped by constant exposure to the genre’s greatest figures, which instilled in her a profound respect for the rhythms and melodies at the heart of the blues. Layla’s musical style blends blues, soul, folk, and country, but always centers on the emotional authenticity and storytelling traditions of the blues.

Layla’s career has seen her perform both as a solo artist and with her full band of New Orleans heavyweights, sharing stages with major acts like Pearl Jam, Lou Reed, Rage Against the Machine, Ani DiFranco, Taj Mahal, Elvin Bishop, and Cyndi Lauper. She has also frequently collaborated with her father, Charlie Musselwhite, and continues to draw inspiration from his legacy. Her new all-original record, produced by Jimbo Mathus and engineered by New Orleans legend Mike Napoletano, is a family affair, featuring contributions from her father and recorded in New Orleans with support from the Threadhead Foundation. Scheduled for release in 2025, the album showcases Layla’s songwriting and musicianship, further cementing her place in the blues tradition.
