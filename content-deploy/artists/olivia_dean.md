## Biography
Olivia Lauryn Dean, born on 14 March 1999 in the London borough of Haringey to a British father and a Jamaican-Guyanese mother, grew up in Walthamstow, North London. She began writing songs at age 16, teaching herself guitar and piano, and performed at her graduation concert, which led to her manager Emily Braham securing an audition as a backing vocalist for Rudimental. Though she struggled with harmonies, this exposure launched her career; her first show was at Hungary's Sziget Festival in 2017 before 16,000 people. In 2018, she self-released debut single 'Reason to Stay' and featured on Rudimental's 'Adrenaline'. Signing with AMF Records and Virgin EMI, she released EPs *OK Love You Bye* (2019) and *What Am I Gonna Do On Sundays?* (2020), with the latter earning a BPI Gold for 'The Hardest Part'.[1][2][4]

Dean's debut album *Messy* (2023) blended **pop soul**, neo-soul, jazz, and pop, earning critical acclaim, a Mercury Prize shortlist, and BBC Music Introducing Artist of the Year. She gained momentum with Glastonbury 2024, a 'The Christmas Song' cover charting at UK #19, and Amazon Music's 2021 Breakthrough Artist award. Her second album *The Art of Loving* (September 2025) marked a breakthrough, led by singles like 'Man I Need'—her first UK #1, Top 5 on Billboard Hot 100, and highest-charting UK song on Spotify Global. Nominated for 2026 Grammy Best New Artist, three 2024 BRITs, and BBC Sound of 2024, Dean became the first British female with three UK Top 10 singles since Adele. Performances included Laneway Festival 2025, Sam Fender support, and *Saturday Night Live*.[1][3][4]

Her style draws from classic songwriting with creamy, jazz-tinged vocals and resilient lyrics rooted in heritage, refusing boxed comparisons to artists like Jorja Smith or Celeste. As of 2025, with Spotify popularity at 92 and over 10 million listeners, Dean's legacy builds as a compelling neo-soul voice.[1][2][3][5]
