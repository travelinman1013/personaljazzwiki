## Biography
Cactus is an American hard rock band formed in late 1969 in New York by former Vanilla Fudge members bassist Tim Bogert and drummer Carmine Appice, after plans to join Jeff Beck fell through due to his motorcycle accident. They recruited guitarist Jim McCarty from Mitch Ryder's Detroit Wheels and vocalist Rusty Day from Ted Nugent's Amboy Dukes, creating a powerhouse lineup known for their heavy, blues-infused proto-metal sound, often dubbed 'The American Led Zeppelin.' The band released three studio albums on Atco Records—Cactus (1970), One Way... or Another (1971), and Restrictions (1971)—before internal conflicts led to McCarty's departure and Day's firing; the final original-era album, 'Ot 'n' Sweaty (1972), featured replacements including vocalist Peter French.[1][2][3]

After the band's 1972 breakup, Bogert and Appice joined Jeff Beck in Beck, Bogert & Appice, while Rusty Day reformed a short-lived version in Florida that lasted until around 1979 but produced no official releases; tragically, Day was murdered in 1982 during a drug deal gone wrong. Various iterations emerged, including the New Cactus Band in 1973. Cactus reunited in 2006 with Appice, Bogert, McCarty, vocalist Jimmy Kunes (ex-Savoy Brown), and harmonica player Randy Pratt, releasing Cactus V; lineup changes continued due to health issues, with Tim Bogert passing in 2021 at age 76. The current version includes Appice, Kunes, guitarist Paul Warren, bassist Jimmy Caputo, and Pratt, maintaining a legacy of raw, high-energy rock.[1][2][6]

Cactus's style blended heavy riffs, powerful rhythms, and gritty blues-rock vocals, capturing the sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll ethos of the era with chaotic live shows often sparking riots or arrests. Despite short-lived original success, their influence endures in hard rock, with sporadic reunions keeping the flame alive into the 2020s.[1][2][3]

## Fun Facts
- Cactus earned the nickname 'The American Led Zeppelin' in 1970 for their heavy sound, emerging just months after Led Zeppelin's debut.[3]
- Vocalist Rusty Day sparked a riot in Boston with anti-police stage banter ('Don’t let those pigs tell you what to do'), leading to his onstage arrest; bassist Tim Bogert sang the encore.[2]
- The band embodied 'sex, drugs and rock’n’roll,' with lyrics and lifestyle reflecting jail time, partying, nudity, and drugs, matching their rowdy audience.[2]
- No official recordings exist from Rusty Day's 1976-1979 Florida Cactus, but live bootlegs circulate online; Day was murdered unsolved in 1982.[1]
