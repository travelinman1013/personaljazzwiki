## Biography
The Lil Rascals Brass Band emerged in the 1990s from the Tremé neighborhood of New Orleans, a cradle of African American musical innovation and brass band tradition. Founded and led by renowned trombonist Corey Henry, the group was initially comprised of young friends from Tremé, each steeped in the city's vibrant second line and social aid and pleasure club culture. Their music draws deeply from the roots of New Orleans jazz, infusing it with contemporary energy and influences from bounce, zydeco, and Cajun genres, reflecting the city's diverse musical tapestry[2][7].

As the band developed, the Lil Rascals became known for their powerful live performances and their ability to blend traditional brass band sounds with modern rhythms and improvisational flair. Their 2001 album 'Buck It Like a Horse' is considered a classic, featuring tracks that have become staples in the New Orleans brass band repertoire, such as 'Rock with Me' and 'For the Love of Money.' The group has played a pivotal role in keeping the brass band tradition alive while pushing its boundaries, inspiring both peers and younger musicians in the process[3][6][7].

Despite facing tragedies, including the early deaths of several members, the Lil Rascals Brass Band's legacy endures through their recordings and the musicians they have influenced. Their sound remains a fixture at second line parades and celebrations throughout New Orleans, and their impact can be heard in the work of contemporary brass bands that continue to evolve the genre[1][4].
