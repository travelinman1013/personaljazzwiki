## Biography
Amy Helm is an acclaimed American singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist whose work bridges the worlds of Americana, modern blues, folk, and gospel. Born in Woodstock, New York, in 1970, she was raised in a vibrant musical environment as the daughter of legendary drummer Levon Helm (of The Band) and singer-songwriter Libby Titus. Her upbringing spanned Woodstock, Los Angeles, and New York City, exposing her to diverse musical traditions and scenes from an early age. Amy began performing in her teens, initially playing in Manhattan bars and later joining her father's blues band, The Barn Burners, where she honed her stagecraft and deepened her commitment to music.[1][3][5]

Helm's career took a significant leap forward when she co-founded the alt-country collective Ollabelle in 2001, a group that quickly gained acclaim for their innovative blend of roots genres and dynamic live performances. She also became a key figure in her father's Midnight Ramble Band, contributing vocals, mandolin, and co-producing his Grammy-winning album 'Dirt Farmer.' Following Levon Helm's passing in 2012, Amy launched her solo career, releasing albums such as 'Didn't It Rain' (2015), 'This Too Shall Light' (2018), and 'What the Flood Leaves Behind' (2021), each showcasing her soulful voice, emotive songwriting, and reverence for American musical traditions.[1][3][4][5]

Amy Helm's musical style is characterized by its emotional honesty, blending elements of blues, gospel, folk, and soul. Her work is deeply autobiographical, often reflecting on themes of loss, resilience, and transformation. Beyond her own recordings, she has played a vital role in preserving and expanding her father's legacy, overseeing Levon Helm Studios and curating events like the Dirt Farmer Festival. Through her artistry and leadership, Amy Helm has established herself as a torchbearer for roots music, inspiring a new generation of musicians.[1][3][4][5]
