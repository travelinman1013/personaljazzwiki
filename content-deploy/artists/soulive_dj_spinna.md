## Biography
DJ Spinna, born Vincent Williams of Panamanian background, grew up in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, and began experimenting with turntables at age 11, collecting records since childhood. He started his professional career as a college DJ at Binghamton University, pursuing hip-hop from 1985 with his first group Top Choice Three, before rising in hip-hop's golden era as a producer for The Jigmastas, which he co-founded and co-owned via Beyond Real Recordings. Known for his multi-dimensional sound blending hip-hop, dance, funk, soul, jazz, and soulful house, Spinna gained acclaim remixing major artists like De La Soul, Mary J. Blige, Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson, and Eminem (on early tracks like 'Three Six Five' and 'Watch Deez' before Eminem's superstardom).[1][2][3][5][7][8]

Spinna's career flourished in the 1990s and 2000s with productions for Mos Def, Talib Kweli, Pharoahe Monch, J-Live, and others, alongside remixes for soul legends (Donald Byrd, Roy Ayers, Eddie Kendricks) and contemporary acts (4 Hero, Les Nubians, Shawn Escoffery's 'Days Like This'). He released solo albums like *Here to There* (2003, BBE), *Intergalactic Soul* (2006), and founded Wonderwax label in 2003 to showcase soulful dance works by himself and artists like Rich Medina. As a world-class DJ, he rocked global venues from Japan to Dubai, collaborating onstage with Gilles Peterson, Q-Tip, Jazzy Jeff, and DJ Shadow, while hosting iconic Stevie Wonder tribute parties WONDER-Full since 1999.[2][3][4][6]

His legacy endures as a versatile icon across genres, with over 20 years crafting beats, curating events like Spinnafest, and influencing dancefloors worldwide through pristine house mixing and hip-hop turntablism, maintaining relevance into the 2020s.[3][5]
