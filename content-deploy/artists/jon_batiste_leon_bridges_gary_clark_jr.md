## Biography
Jon Batiste (born November 11, 1986, in Kenner, Louisiana), Gary Clark Jr. (born February 15, 1984, in Austin, Texas), and Leon Bridges (born July 13, 1989, in Atlanta, Georgia, raised in Fort Worth, Texas) are three prominent American musicians known for their soulful, genre-blending styles—Batiste in jazz and R&B, Clark in blues-rock, and Bridges in retro soul—who have notably collaborated on the 2017 single 'Ohio,' a cover of Neil Young's song released by Batiste.[2][3][4] Batiste was born into a musical dynasty in Louisiana, playing percussion with the Batiste Brothers Band at age 8 before switching to piano at 11, honing skills through classical lessons and video game transcriptions; he rose as bandleader of Stay Human on *The Late Show with Stephen Colbert* (2015-2022), releasing albums like *Hollywood Africans* (2018) while performing at major events including Grammy tributes and NBA All-Star Games.[2][3] Gary Clark Jr. emerged from Austin's blues scene, performing teen gigs before mentor Clifford Antone connected him with Jimmie Vaughan; he signed with Warner Bros. in 2011, releasing *The Bright Lights* EP, *Blak and Blu* (2012), and *The Story of Sonny Boy Slim* (2015), earning acclaim for fusing blues, rock, soul, and hip-hop, with prolific live recordings and festival highlights like Glastonbury 2013.[1] Their joint 'Ohio' track, alongside shared TV appearances like *The Late Show* (2019) and Grammy performances (2018), underscores a legacy of cross-generational soul revival, civil rights advocacy (Batiste notably), and high-energy live collaborations blending New Orleans jazz, Texas blues, and vintage R&B influences.[1][2][4][5]
