## Biography
Jamar Rolando McNaughton, professionally known as Chronixx, was born on October 10, 1992, in Spanish Town, Jamaica, into a musically rich family. His stage name evolved from "Little Chronicle," a nickname given to him as the junior to his father, the dancehall artist Chronicle. From an early age, Chronixx demonstrated exceptional musical talent, writing his first song "Rice Grain" at just five years old and becoming a choir director and worship leader by age 11. He was formally introduced to professional recording at 11 years old when he worked with producer Danny Browne on a gospel track. Throughout his teenage years at St. Catherine High School, Chronixx harmonized for gospel artists like Jermaine Edwards and reggae artist Lutan Fyah, while simultaneously beginning production work, composing riddims for artists such as Konshens, Munga Honorable, and Popcaan.

Chronixx's career trajectory accelerated significantly following personal tragedies that deepened his artistic commitment. After his brother's death in 2009, he met Romaine "Teflon" Arnett of ZincFence Recordz, a collaboration that catalyzed his emergence as a solo artist with a distinctive voice and conscious lyrical approach. In 2010, producer Alty "J.O.E" Nunes became instrumental in shaping his career, leading to the formation of the Jah Ova Evil collective. Following J.O.E's passing in February 2011, Chronixx channeled his grief into his music, releasing impactful singles including "Behind Curtain," "African Heritage," "Wall Street," and "Warrior." His breakthrough came in 2012 when he gained significant airplay in Jamaica and performed at major festivals including Reggae Sumfest, with his popularity further amplified by a feature on Major Lazer's 2013 mixtape "Start A Fyah."

By 2014, Chronixx had established himself as a leading figure in Jamaica's reggae revival movement, alongside artists like Protoje, Jah9, and Kabaka Pyramid. His 2014 EP "Dread and Terrible" charted on Billboard's top reggae albums, and his debut album "Chronology" (released July 7, 2015) showcased his versatility and deep roots knowledge, featuring collaborations including a track with his father. His lyrical content centers on themes of anti-war messaging, romantic declarations, and resilience, all delivered through a conscious Rastafari perspective. Chronixx has maintained his humble ethos and commitment to reggae's spiritual and social mission despite achieving global recognition, including multiple appearances on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, establishing himself as one of Jamaica's most promising contemporary reggae artists.
