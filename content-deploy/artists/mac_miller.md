## Biography
Malcolm James McCormick, known professionally as Mac Miller, was born on January 19, 1992, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He began rapping at age 14 and quickly became a fixture in Pittsburgh’s hip hop scene, releasing his first mixtapes as a teenager. In 2010, Miller signed with Rostrum Records and gained national attention with his mixtapes 'K.I.D.S.' (2010) and 'Best Day Ever' (2011), the latter featuring the platinum-certified single 'Donald Trump.' His debut studio album, 'Blue Slide Park' (2011), made history as the first independently distributed debut album to top the US Billboard 200 in over 15 years.

Miller’s artistry evolved rapidly, moving from party-centric 'frat rap' to more introspective and experimental work. He produced music under various aliases, including Larry Fisherman, and founded his own label, REMember Music, in 2013. After leaving Rostrum, he signed with Warner Bros. Records, releasing acclaimed albums such as 'GO:OD AM' (2015), 'The Divine Feminine' (2016), and 'Swimming' (2018). His collaborations with artists like Ariana Grande and Anderson .Paak highlighted his versatility and deepening musicality. Miller was open about his struggles with substance abuse and mental health, themes that permeated his later work. He died of an accidental drug overdose on September 7, 2018, in Los Angeles, leaving behind a legacy of innovation and emotional honesty in hip hop.

Mac Miller’s influence continues through posthumous releases, including 'Circles' (2020), which further showcased his growth as a songwriter and producer. His willingness to experiment, vulnerability in his lyrics, and support for emerging artists have cemented his status as a beloved and influential figure in contemporary music.
