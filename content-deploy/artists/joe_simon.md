## Biography
Joe Simon was born in Simmesport, Louisiana, with sources citing either September 2, 1943, or September 7, 1936, as his birthdate. Raised in a Baptist church, Simon began his musical journey singing gospel before his family relocated to Oakland, California, in the late 1950s. There, he joined the Golden West Gospel Singers, who eventually transitioned to secular music as The Golden Tones, releasing their first single in 1959. Simon’s solo career began in earnest after encouragement from Hush Records, leading to his first national hit, 'My Adorable One,' in 1964.

Simon’s career took off after signing with Nashville producer John Richbourg for Sound Stage 7 Records, where he developed a distinctive Southern soul style with country influences. He achieved major success in the late 1960s and 1970s, scoring hits like 'The Chokin’ Kind' (1969), 'Power of Love,' and 'Drowning in the Sea of Love,' the latter two recorded in Philadelphia with the famed MFSB session musicians. Over his career, Simon amassed 50 charting songs, including three number one R&B singles, and became known for his emotive vocal delivery and crossover appeal.

In 1988, at the height of his success, Simon retired from secular music to become a minister, founding his own ministries and dedicating the rest of his life to preaching. He refused to perform his R&B hits after this transition, focusing instead on his faith and community work. Joe Simon passed away on December 13, 2021, in Chicago, Illinois, leaving a legacy as one of soul music’s most respected and influential voices.
