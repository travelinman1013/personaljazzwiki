## Biography
Garnet Mimms, born Garrett Mimms on November 16, 1933, in Ashland, West Virginia, is a pioneering American soul and rhythm & blues singer whose emotive, gospel-infused vocal style helped shape the sound of 1960s soul. Raised in Philadelphia, Mimms began singing in church choirs and gospel groups such as the Evening Stars and the Harmonizing Four, which laid the foundation for his powerful, pleading vocal delivery. After an early stint with the Norfolk Four and military service, he returned to Philadelphia and formed the doo-wop group The Gainors in 1958, alongside Sam Bell and Howard Tate.

Mimms achieved national recognition as the lead singer of Garnet Mimms & The Enchanters, scoring a major hit in 1963 with 'Cry Baby,' a song later famously covered by Janis Joplin. The group’s collaboration with songwriters and producers Bert Berns and Jerry Ragovoy brought a new, uptown soul sound that blended Mimms’ gospel roots with contemporary R&B. After leaving The Enchanters in 1964, Mimms pursued a solo career, releasing several singles and albums that became staples of the British Northern soul scene. Despite stepping away from the music industry in the late 1960s to focus on ministry work, Mimms’ influence endured, and he returned to recording in the 2000s, releasing a gospel album in 2008.

Mimms' legacy is marked by his role as one of the earliest true soul singers, with a style that bridged gospel intensity and secular soul. His work has been celebrated by the Rhythm and Blues Foundation and continues to inspire generations of vocalists and soul enthusiasts.
