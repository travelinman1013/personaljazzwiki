## Biography
Bill Henderson, born William Randall Henderson on March 19, 1926, in Chicago, Illinois, was a celebrated American jazz vocalist and actor whose career spanned more than six decades. He began singing as a child and launched his professional music career in the early 1950s, performing with the Ramsey Lewis Trio in Chicago before relocating to New York in 1958. Henderson quickly made his mark in the jazz world with his soulful phrasing and distinctive vocal style, notably recording a hit vocal version of Horace Silver’s 'Señor Blues' for Blue Note Records in the mid-1950s, which became one of the label’s top-selling singles. His debut album as a leader, 'Bill Henderson Sings' (1958), featured trumpeter Booker Little and established him as a rising star in vocal jazz.[1][2][3][4][5][7]

Throughout his career, Henderson collaborated with many of jazz’s greatest figures, including Oscar Peterson, Count Basie, Dizzy Gillespie, Jimmy Smith, Yusef Lateef, and Eddie Harris. His 1963 album 'Bill Henderson with the Oscar Peterson Trio' is widely regarded as a classic. Henderson’s artistry was characterized by his nuanced phrasing and ability to imbue each lyric with emotional depth, drawing comparisons to Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennett, and Johnny Hartman. In addition to his musical achievements, Henderson enjoyed a successful parallel career as a film and television actor, appearing in productions such as 'City Slickers,' 'White Men Can’t Jump,' and 'Lethal Weapon 4.' He continued to perform at major jazz festivals and prestigious venues like the Kennedy Center and Lincoln Center well into his later years, leaving a lasting legacy as a master interpreter of the American songbook.[1][2][3][4][5][7]
