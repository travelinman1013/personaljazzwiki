## Biography
Hayward 'Chuck' Carbo (January 11, 1926 – July 11, 2008) was a prominent American R&B and doo-wop singer, best known as the lead vocalist for The Spiders, a New Orleans-based group that achieved significant success in the 1950s. Born in Houma, Louisiana, Carbo moved with his family to New Orleans in the early 1930s, where he and his brother Leonard ('Chick') sang in their father's church choir, deeply influenced by gospel traditions and groups like the Golden Gate Quartet and the King Cole Trio. After serving in the Coast Guard during World War II, the brothers formed the Zion City Harmonizers, later known as the Delta Southernaires, before transitioning to secular music and founding The Spiders in 1953.

With Chuck as lead, The Spiders scored several R&B hits, including 'I Didn't Want to Do It,' 'I'm Slippin' In,' and 'Witchcraft,' the latter co-written by Dave Bartholomew and later covered by Elvis Presley. Following internal group changes and a brief solo stint, Carbo's career slowed, leading him to take non-musical jobs. However, the 1980s saw a revival of his musical activity, culminating in acclaimed solo albums such as 'Life's Ups and Downs' (1988) and 'Drawers Trouble' (1993), which featured collaborations with New Orleans legends like Dr. John and Edward Frank. Carbo's distinctive voice and authentic New Orleans style left a lasting mark on the city's R&B and doo-wop legacy.
