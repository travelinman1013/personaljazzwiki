## Biography
Vijay Iyer is an acclaimed American pianist, composer, and bandleader whose innovative approach has redefined contemporary jazz and creative music. Born in 1971 in Rochester, New York, to Indian immigrant parents, Iyer began classical violin lessons at age three but soon gravitated toward the piano, teaching himself and developing a deep connection to the instrument. His early musical experiences blended the devotional songs and folk rhythms of his Indian heritage with the pop and jazz sounds of his American upbringing, including influences from artists like Prince, James Brown, Miles Davis, and Thelonious Monk[5][7].

Iyer attended Yale College, earning a B.S. in physics in 1992, and later completed a Ph.D. in the cognitive science of music at the University of California, Berkeley in 1998[2]. His academic background informs his music, which is marked by intricate rhythmic structures, melodic inventiveness, and a keen sense of improvisation. Over the past three decades, Iyer has released more than two dozen albums as a leader, including acclaimed works such as 'Historicity,' 'Accelerando,' and 'A Cosmic Rhythm with Each Stroke.' He is known for his genre-blurring collaborations and compositions for both jazz ensembles and classical groups, with commissions from major orchestras and chamber ensembles worldwide[3][6].

Iyer’s legacy is defined by his role as a boundary-pushing artist and educator. He has served as Artistic Director of the Banff International Workshop in Jazz and Creative Music, composer-in-residence at London’s Wigmore Hall, and artist-in-residence at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. His many honors include a MacArthur Fellowship, three Grammy nominations, and numerous international awards, cementing his status as a leading voice in 21st-century music[1][4][6].
