## Biography
William Royce "Boz" Scaggs, born June 8, 1944, in Canton, Ohio, is an American singer, songwriter, and guitarist celebrated for his smooth blend of rock, soul, R&B, and jazz. Scaggs began his musical journey as a teenager, first performing with Steve Miller in the Marksmen and later in the Ardells while attending the University of Wisconsin–Madison. After leaving college in 1963, he traveled through Europe, recording his debut solo album in Sweden before returning to the United States to join the burgeoning San Francisco music scene. In 1967, Scaggs joined the Steve Miller Band, contributing to their first two albums before embarking on his solo career.

Scaggs released his self-titled album in 1969, but it was not until 1976's 'Silk Degrees' that he achieved mainstream success. The album, which peaked at number 2 on the Billboard 200, featured the Grammy-winning hit 'Lowdown' and the enduring favorite 'Lido Shuffle.' Scaggs became known for his genre-defying style, seamlessly weaving elements of yacht rock, AOR, soul, and blues into his music. His subsequent albums, including 'Down Two Then Left' and 'Middle Man,' continued his commercial success, producing several top-40 singles. After a hiatus in the 1980s, Scaggs returned to recording and touring, remaining an influential figure in American popular music through the 2010s with releases like 'Out of the Blues' in 2018.

Scaggs' legacy is marked by his role in shaping the West Coast sound of the 1970s and fostering the careers of musicians who would go on to form the band Toto. His work is often cited as quintessential yacht rock, and his smooth, soulful vocals and sophisticated songwriting have influenced generations of artists. Beyond recording, Scaggs contributed to the live music scene by opening the San Francisco nightclub Slim's, further cementing his impact on American music culture.
