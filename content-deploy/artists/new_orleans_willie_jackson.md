## Biography
New Orleans Willie Jackson (born 1896 or 1897, Louisiana, USA; died after 1930) was an American blues and jazz singer whose career flourished in the vibrant musical scenes of New Orleans and later New York City[1][2][3]. Emerging during the early 20th century, Jackson became known for his expressive vocal style, which blended elements of ragtime, classic blues, and early jazz—a reflection of the diverse influences circulating in New Orleans at the time. His performances often featured lively rhythms and a strong sense of storytelling, making him a popular figure in local clubs and dance halls.

Jackson's career developed alongside the evolution of jazz and blues, and he was active during a period when these genres were rapidly gaining national attention. While specific details about his early life remain scarce, records indicate that he was not only a singer but also a dancer, contributing to the dynamic stage shows that characterized the era[3]. His legacy is tied to the foundational years of American blues and jazz, and although his fame did not reach the heights of some contemporaries, his recordings and live performances helped shape the sound of early New Orleans music.

After relocating to New York City, Jackson continued to perform and record, though documentation of his later life and career is limited. His influence persists through the preservation of his recordings and the continued interest in the roots of American blues and jazz, marking him as a significant—if somewhat enigmatic—figure in the history of these genres.
