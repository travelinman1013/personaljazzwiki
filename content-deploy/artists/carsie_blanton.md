## Biography
Carsie Blanton is an American singer-songwriter known for her witty, provocative lyrics and genre-blending musical style. Born in Luray, Virginia, she began playing piano at age six and guitar at thirteen, inspired by her grandfather and a teenage girl she saw playing guitar at summer camp[3][4][1]. Raised under the educational philosophy of unschooling, Blanton developed a creative and independent approach to life and music, often learning through experience rather than formal schooling[1].

At sixteen, Blanton moved to Eugene, Oregon, where she immersed herself in a vibrant artistic community, living frugally and working odd jobs while honing her craft. She started her first band, sang backup in a touring funk group, and discovered swing dancing, which deepened her love for jazz[1]. Blanton self-released her debut album, "Ain't So Green," in 2005, and continued to build her career with frequent live performances and subsequent albums such as "Buoy" and "Idiot Heart." Her music draws from folk, jazz, soul, and pop, and she is recognized for her storytelling, directness, and humor[1][2].

Blanton has sustained her career for over fifteen years by embracing a pay-what-you-want model and maintaining creative control over her work[2]. She has toured extensively, opened for artists like Joan Osborne and Loudon Wainwright III, and participated in stage productions such as Anaïs Mitchell’s "Hadestown." Based in New Orleans, Blanton continues to release music and engage with fans through innovative projects, leaving a legacy as a fiercely independent and original artist[1][2].
