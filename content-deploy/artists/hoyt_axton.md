## Biography
Hoyt Wayne Axton (March 25, 1938 – October 26, 1999) was an American singer‑songwriter, guitarist, and actor whose career bridged folk, country, rock, and pop. Born in Duncan, Oklahoma, he was the son of Mae Boren Axton, a prominent country songwriter best known for co‑writing Elvis Presley’s hit “Heartbreak Hotel.”[1][6] Axton grew up partly in Oklahoma and Jacksonville, Florida, graduating from Robert E. Lee High School in 1956 before briefly attending Oklahoma State University on a football scholarship.[1][3] He left college to enlist in the U.S. Navy, serving as a petty officer second class aboard the USS Princeton and USS Ranger; after his discharge in the early 1960s he gravitated to the West Coast folk scene, performing in coffeehouses and nightclubs around Los Angeles and San Francisco.[1][2]

Axton’s first album, *The Balladeer* (recorded live at the Troubadour), marked him as a powerful, earthy folk voice, and his breakthrough as a songwriter came when the Kingston Trio turned his “Greenback Dollar” into a 1963 hit.[1][2] Through the 1960s and 1970s he wrote a string of major songs for other artists, including “The Pusher” (recorded by Steppenwolf), “Joy to the World” and “Never Been to Spain” (hits for Three Dog Night), and “No No Song” (a Top 10 hit for Ringo Starr).[1][2][5][4] As a recording artist he moved from Vee‑Jay and Surrey to Columbia, Capitol, A&M, MCA, and finally his own Jeremiah Records, releasing albums such as *My Griffin Is Gone*, *Less Than the Song*, *Life Machine*, *Southbound*, and *Rusty Old Halo*; his own country hits included “When the Morning Comes,” “Boney Fingers,” “Della and the Dealer,” and “Rusty Old Halo.”[1][2][3][4] Parallel to his music career, Axton became a familiar character actor in film and television, appearing in *Smoky*, *The Black Stallion*, *Heart Like a Wheel*, *Gremlins*, and numerous TV series, while also doing extensive commercial and documentary voice‑over work.[1][4] Known for his rich baritone, narrative songwriting, and wry humor, he left a lasting legacy as a cross‑genre writer whose songs became standards of the 1960s and 1970s rock and country repertoire.[1][2][5]

Axton’s musical style drew heavily on folk storytelling, country twang, and rock and blues grooves, often blending humor with social commentary. Critics and historians note that he was as influential as a songwriter as he was as a performer, shaping the sound of mainstream rock (through Steppenwolf and Three Dog Night), country‑rock, and 1970s country radio.[2][5] In later years he continued to tour heavily, sometimes playing up to 300 dates a year, and hosted and narrated the country‑music profile series *Life and Times* on The Nashville Network in the mid‑1990s.[1][4] He spent his final years largely in Montana, where he owned a ranch, and died in Victor, Montana, in 1999 at age 61 following a heart attack, leaving behind a catalog that continues to be recorded and performed by a wide range of artists.[1][4][6]

## Fun Facts
- Hoyt Axton’s mother, Mae Boren Axton, was nicknamed the “Queen of Nashville” for her role in launching Elvis Presley’s career and co‑writing “Heartbreak Hotel,” meaning Hoyt grew up in one of country music’s most connected families.[3][6]
- He named his own record label Jeremiah Records after the opening line of his song “Joy to the World” (“Jeremiah was a bullfrog”), which Three Dog Night turned into the biggest hit of 1971.[1][2]
- Before fully committing to music, Axton played college football at Oklahoma State University and then served in the U.S. Navy aboard the aircraft carriers USS Princeton and USS Ranger.[1][2]
- Axton became recognizable beyond music through acting and commercial work: he played the inventor father Randall Peltzer in the film *Gremlins* and lent his distinctive voice to major TV ad campaigns for brands such as McDonald’s, Pizza Hut, and Busch beer.[1][4]
