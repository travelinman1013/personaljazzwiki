## Biography
Sidney Joseph Bechet (May 14, 1897 – May 14, 1959) was born into a middle-class Creole family in New Orleans, Louisiana, where he displayed prodigious musical talent from a young age. Starting on clarinet at age six, largely self-taught but with brief studies under clarinetists George Baquet and Lorenzo Tio, Jr., Bechet quickly rose in local bands like the Young Olympians and Eagle Band by his early teens. By 13, he was performing professionally, and at 16, he toured the South with pianist Clarence Williams, later joining King Oliver's band, establishing himself as a pioneering jazz soloist ahead of Louis Armstrong.[1][2][3][4][6]

Bechet's career took him to Chicago, New York, and Europe; in 1919, he joined Will Marion Cook's Southern Syncopated Orchestra, touring London where Swiss conductor Ernst Ansermet hailed him as a 'genius.' There, he adopted the soprano saxophone, mastering it with a distinctive vibrato and throaty tone that popularized the instrument in jazz and influenced the swing style's departure from ragtime. He recorded early jazz sides in 1923 with Clarence Williams' Blue Five featuring Louis Armstrong, worked briefly with Duke Ellington in 1924, and experimented with Latin jazz elements in 1939 alongside Willie 'The Lion' Smith. His fiery temperament often disrupted collaborations, leading to obscurity in the 1930s, but a New Orleans revival brought acclaim, culminating in his move to Paris in 1951 where he became a national hero.[1][2][3][4][5][6]

Bechet's legacy endures as one of jazz's first virtuoso soloists, known for his powerful, operatic soprano sax and clarinet playing that bridged early jazz improvisation with swing. Spending his final years in France, he composed hits like 'Petite Fleur' and died on his 62nd birthday, leaving an indelible mark on the genre's evolution.[1][3][4][6]
