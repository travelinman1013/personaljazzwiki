## Biography
The Coasters, an American rhythm and blues/rock and roll vocal group, emerged from the Los Angeles-based group the Robins in October 1955.  Carl Gardner and Bobby Nunn, leaving the Robins, signed with Atlantic Records and formed the Coasters, so named for their relocation from the West Coast to the East Coast.  The initial lineup included Gardner, Nunn, Billy Guy, and Leon Hughes (later replaced by Young Jessie on some early recordings), along with guitarist Adolph Jacobs.  Their early work was significantly shaped by their association with the songwriting and producing team of Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, who had previously worked with the Robins, producing their hit "Smokey Joe's Cafe."  This collaboration proved pivotal in launching the Coasters' career.

The Coasters' partnership with Leiber and Stoller yielded a string of humorous "storytelling" hits that defined the early rock and roll era.  Their first single, "Down in Mexico," was an R&B hit in 1956.  The following year, "Young Blood"/"Searchin'" propelled them into the pop charts, with "Searchin'" becoming their first U.S. Top 10 hit and the biggest R&B single of 1957.  The lineup shifted in late 1957, with Gardner and Guy moving to New York alongside Cornell Gunter and Will "Dub" Jones. This configuration recorded "Yakety Yak," featuring King Curtis on saxophone, which became their only national number-one single.  Subsequent hits included "Charlie Brown," "Along Came Jones," and "Poison Ivy."  Despite continued success with Leiber and Stoller, including a later collaboration on "Love Potion No. 9" (though initially given to the Clovers), changing musical tastes and lineup changes led to a decline in chart success during the 1960s.  The group later signed with Columbia Records' Date label, reuniting with Leiber and Stoller, but failed to recapture their earlier fame.  A 1994 Volkswagen advertisement featuring "Sorry But I'm Gonna Have to Pass" briefly revived their popularity in Britain.

The Coasters' musical style blended rhythm and blues and rock and roll, characterized by their humorous storytelling lyrics and catchy melodies. Their collaborations with Leiber and Stoller were instrumental in shaping their sound and success.  Their legacy is cemented by their induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987 as the first group inducted, and their subsequent induction into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 1999.  Despite lineup changes and the passing of several members, including Leon Hughes in 2023, the Coasters' influence on rock and roll and doo-wop remains significant, with their music continuing to be enjoyed and appreciated.  The name "Coasters" continues to be used, though with various lineups, with Carl Gardner's widow Veta Gardner owning the rights to the name.
