# Jesse Welles & joan baez

## Biography
Jesse Welles is a contemporary folk punk musician recognized as a modern folk artist, often compared to Bob Dylan for his protest songs and unconventional voice, though critics argue he lacks the depth of his predecessors. He gained prominence through social media, particularly TikTok, by recording politically and socially charged tunes in forest settings, earning the nickname 'forest troubadour.' Welles has built a following in the folk punk and folk genres, with a Spotify popularity score of 57, and has performed at notable events like the 2025 Americana Music Awards where he presented a Lifetime Achievement Award to John Fogerty.

His career highlights include high-profile collaborations with folk legend Joan Baez, solidifying his place in folk music circles. In late 2025, Baez featured on his song 'No Kings,' and they performed a duet of Bob Dylan's 'Don't Think Twice, It's All Right' at a San Francisco show, drawing praise for their chemistry. Welles' style blends folk traditions with contemporary social commentary, though some reviews critique it as imitative rather than innovative. His work reflects a desire to be seen as the 'voice of a TikTok generation,' focusing on polemic songwriting amid digital immediacy.

Welles continues to rise, with these Baez collaborations indicating potential for broader recognition in Americana and folk scenes, building on his grassroots online presence.

## Fun Facts
