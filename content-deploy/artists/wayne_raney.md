## Biography
Wayne Raney (August 17, 1921 – January 23, 1993) was an influential American country singer, harmonica virtuoso, and songwriter, born near Wolf Bayou, Arkansas. Born with a foot deformity that prevented him from doing heavy farm work, Raney was drawn to music early, inspired after hearing a street performer play harmonica. By age 13, he was performing on the powerful border radio station XEPN in Piedras Negras, Mexico, and soon after began a long and fruitful partnership with harmonica player Lonnie Glosson. Together, they became radio stars, notably at WCKY in Cincinnati, and popularized the harmonica through a highly successful mail-order business that sold millions of instruments and lessons, making the harmonica a staple in American homes.

After World War II, Raney joined the Delmore Brothers, contributing his energetic harmonica to their boogie-infused country hits, and then launched a solo career in 1948. His early singles, including "Lost John Boogie" and "Jack and Jill Boogie," reached the country Top 15, but it was his 1949 chart-topping hit "Why Don't You Haul Off and Love Me" that cemented his place in country music history. Raney performed on the Grand Ole Opry, toured with Lefty Frizzell, and appeared on major radio and TV shows such as the California Hayride and WWVA Jamboree. In the late 1950s, he became a DJ, opened a recording studio, and founded the Rimrock label, releasing his own music and supporting bluegrass and gospel artists. He continued to record and perform into the 1960s and 1970s, later running a chicken farm and making occasional appearances on the TV show Hee Haw.

Raney's musical style blended traditional country, honky tonk, and early rockabilly, marked by his lively harmonica and witty songwriting. He was a prolific songwriter with over 200 credited songs and is considered a forerunner of rockabilly. His legacy includes not only his recordings but also his role in popularizing the harmonica and mentoring younger musicians. Posthumously, he was inducted into the Country Music DJ Hall of Fame and honored with a Lifetime Achievement Award by the Arkansas Country Music Awards.
