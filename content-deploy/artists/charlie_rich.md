## Biography
Charles Allan Rich was born on December 14, 1932, in Forrest City, Arkansas, to a hard-drinking shapcropper father and a Bible-thumping mother.[3] Rich grew up immersed in jazz and blues, playing saxophone in his high school marching band where he met his future wife, Margaret Ann Greene, whom he married in 1952.[2] After one year at the University of Arkansas, he enlisted in the Air Force in 1953, where he was stationed in Oklahoma and formed a jazz and blues group called "the Velvetones" with his wife on vocals.[4] Upon leaving the military in 1956, the couple returned to West Memphis to farm, while Rich began performing in local clubs and co-writing songs with Margaret Ann.

Rich's early recording career proved frustrating despite his considerable musical talent. He signed with Sun Records in 1957 as a songwriter and studio musician, eventually releasing his own records starting in 1958.[1] His first significant hit came in 1960 with "Lonely Weekends," which reached No. 22 on the pop charts, but subsequent releases largely failed commercially.[2] Throughout the 1960s, Rich recorded for various labels including Groove and Smash Records, struggling to find the right sound and style despite producing some of his finest work. His breakthrough finally arrived in 1973 when producer Billy Sherrill at Epic Records helped him refashion himself as a Nashville sound balladeer, resulting in the massive crossover hits "Behind Closed Doors" (No. 1 on both country and pop charts) and "The Most Beautiful Girl" (also topping both charts).[1][4] These twin successes earned him Grammy Awards and Country Music Association recognition, establishing him as a superstar after two decades of struggle.

Rich's later career maintained momentum through the mid-1970s with additional chart-toppers including "A Very Special Love Song," "I Love My Friend," and "Rolling With The Flow."[3] Known as the "Silver Fox" due to his distinctive silver hair, Rich became a sought-after headliner with million-selling singles that appealed to both country and pop audiences.[5] Though his commercial success eventually waned, his eclectic blend of rockabilly, country, blues, and jazz influences established him as one of the most musically gifted artists of his generation. He was inducted into the Memphis Music Hall of Fame in 2015, and in 2023, Rolling Stone ranked him at number 120 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.[4] Rich passed away on July 25, 1995.

## Fun Facts
- Rich acquired the nickname 'the Silver Fox' later in his life due to his distinctive silver hair, which became iconic during his superstar years in the 1970s.[4]
- Before becoming a country star, Rich wrote songs for other legendary Sun Records artists, including 'I'll Make It All Up to You' for Jerry Lee Lewis and 'Ways of a Woman in Love' for fellow Arkansas native Johnny Cash.[2]
- Despite being one of the most musically gifted rockabilly artists of the first generation, Rich considered himself primarily a jazz pianist and had not paid much attention to country music since childhood, making his eventual crossover success particularly remarkable.[4]
- Rich's album 'Behind Closed Doors' won Album of the Year from the Country Music Association and a Grammy Award, with songs from the album subsequently appearing in dozens of movies and television shows.[2]
