## Biography
John Beasley, born October 10, 1958 in Shreveport, Louisiana, is a renowned jazz pianist, bandleader, composer, and arranger whose career bridges jazz, pop, and visual media. Raised in a family deeply rooted in music—his grandfather was a trombonist and band director, his father a prize-winning composer and educator, and his mother a brass instrumentalist and conductor—Beasley was immersed in music from an early age. He began piano studies at eight, later exploring guitar, drums, saxophone, trumpet, and oboe, before returning to piano and jazz as his primary focus.[1][2][6]

Beasley’s professional breakthrough came at age 20 with a major concert at Carnegie Hall alongside flutist Hubert Laws, bassist John Patitucci, and drummer Joey Heredia. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, he became a fixture in the Los Angeles jazz and R&B scenes, touring with Sergio Mendes and joining the bands of jazz legends Miles Davis and Freddie Hubbard while still in his twenties. His versatility led to extensive studio work, including composing and arranging for film and television, with credits on iconic scores such as 'Star Trek: The Next Generation,' 'Cheers,' and numerous Thomas Newman films including 'The Shawshank Redemption,' 'Skyfall,' and 'Finding Dory.'[2][4][6]

Beasley’s artistry extends to bandleading and orchestration, most notably with his acclaimed big band MONK’estra, which earned multiple Grammy nominations and showcased his inventive arrangements of Thelonious Monk’s music. He has served as Music Director for the Herbie Hancock Institute of Jazz, collaborated with major artists across genres, and conducted commissions for leading European jazz orchestras. His legacy is marked by his innovative approach to jazz, his influential work in music education, and his ability to seamlessly blend jazz tradition with contemporary sounds.[3][4][5]
