## Biography
Johnny Dowd (born John David Dowd on March 29, 1948, in Fort Worth, Texas) is an American alternative blues country musician from Ithaca, New York, who emerged as a distinctive voice in the singer-songwriter tradition despite an unconventional path to music. After forty years of hard living—including time in the Army and years in California—Dowd settled in Ithaca in the 1970s, where he remained while working outside the music industry. He didn't pursue songwriting intentionally; rather, he turned to it out of necessity around 1988 when the singer of his Memphis/Texas swamp blues band quit. Unable to learn songs from records like other band members, Dowd began writing original material simply to keep the band playing, an act of creative desperation that launched an unexpected career.

Dowd's debut solo album, Wrong Side of Memphis (1998), arrived when he was nearly 50 years old, introducing audiences to his gloomy murder ballads and wracked country-folk-rock sound that drew immediate comparisons to Nick Cave. His unflinching songwriting, influenced by the traditions of Tom Waits and Charles Bukowski, conjures vivid characters with bluntness and telling details—a true writer's approach to songcraft. The New York Times highlighted him in 2001 as one of four "Country Singers Who Still Display a Country Heart," and he made his major film debut in Jim White's Searching for the Wrong-Eyed Jesus. Since then, Dowd has maintained a prolific output, releasing records annually while touring extensively across the US and Europe, building a devoted fanbase particularly among punk rockers despite—or perhaps because of—his genre-defying sound that ranges from country to jazz to blues and beyond.

Dowd's 19th studio album, Is Heaven Real? (How Would I Know?), represents his most ambitious work to date, bringing together longtime bandmates and a constellation of Memphis musicians to capture the gripping soul and R&B that captivated him in his Southern youth. His music operates in what might be called the "southern gothic" tradition, exploring the darkest corners of American life with poetic precision and a soulful, wry vocal delivery that transforms each song into its own complete world.
