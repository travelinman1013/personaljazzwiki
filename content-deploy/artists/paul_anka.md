## Biography
Paul Anka was born on July 30, 1941, in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, to Lebanese-Syrian immigrant parents. He developed a passion for music early on, singing in his church choir and teaching himself to play piano and guitar. Anka formed a vocal group called the Bobbysoxers and began writing his own songs, blending influences from his Middle Eastern heritage and contemporary popular music. At 15, he traveled to New York City to pursue a music career, where his original song 'Diana' caught the attention of record executives, leading to a contract with ABC-Paramount Records. This marked the beginning of his rise to international fame as a teen idol and prolific songwriter. 'Diana' became a massive hit, selling over 20 million copies, and Anka continued his success with hits like 'Lonely Boy' and 'Put Your Head on My Shoulder.' As the 1960s progressed, Anka transitioned from teen idol to a successful songwriter, writing for artists like Frank Sinatra and Tom Jones. He penned iconic songs such as 'My Way' and 'She's a Lady.' Anka's career spans over six decades, with achievements including writing the theme song for 'The Tonight Show' and collaborating with Michael Jackson on 'Love Never Felt So Good.' In 2013, Anka released his autobiography, 'My Way,' and a duets album featuring artists like Frank Sinatra and Michael Jackson. Anka's legacy is marked by his versatility and enduring impact on popular music.
