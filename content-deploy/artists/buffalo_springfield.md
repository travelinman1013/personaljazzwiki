## Biography
Buffalo Springfield was a pioneering folk rock and country rock band formed in Los Angeles, California, in 1966. The group emerged from a chance meeting in a Los Angeles traffic jam between Stephen Stills and Richie Furay—both veterans of the Greenwich Village folk scene—and Canadian musicians Neil Young and Bruce Palmer, who were drawn to the burgeoning West Coast music movement. Drummer Dewey Martin, another Canadian, soon joined, completing the classic lineup. The band took its name from a steamroller manufactured by the Buffalo Springfield Roller Company, spotted outside their house in Hollywood.

Buffalo Springfield quickly became known for their inventive songwriting, intricate harmonies, and masterful musicianship. Their music blended elements of folk, country, and rock, with influences from the British Invasion and psychedelic rock. Their debut single, 'Nowadays Clancy Can’t Even Sing,' was a local hit, but it was 'For What It’s Worth'—written by Stills in response to protests on the Sunset Strip—that became their defining anthem and a symbol of 1960s counterculture. Despite internal tensions, lineup changes, and legal troubles, the band released three influential albums: 'Buffalo Springfield' (1966), 'Buffalo Springfield Again' (1967), and 'Last Time Around' (1968).

Though Buffalo Springfield's career lasted less than two years, their impact was profound. The group is credited with laying the groundwork for the folk rock and country rock genres and launching the careers of its members, who would go on to shape the sound of American rock music for decades. The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997, cementing their legacy as one of the most influential acts of the 1960s.
