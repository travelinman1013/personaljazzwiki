## Biography
The Rumble is a dynamic New Orleans-based band formed by seven Grammy-nominated musicians, fronted by Big Chief Joseph Boudreaux Jr. of the Young Eagles Black Masking Indian tribe. The group was founded by former members of the acclaimed Mardi Gras Indian Funk band Cha Wa, including Boudreaux, trumpeter Aurélien Barnes, trombonist José Maize Jr., bassist TJ Norris, guitarist Ari Teitel, keyboardist Andriu Yanovski, and drummer Trenton O’Neal. Their music is deeply rooted in the rich cultural traditions of New Orleans, blending the electrifying spirit of Black Masking Indian carnival with modern funk, brass, and soul influences[2][3][4][6][8].

Joseph Boudreaux Jr., a third-generation New Orleanian and Black Masking Indian Chief, grew up surrounded by legendary musicians such as The Neville Brothers and The Meters, who frequently visited his father, Monk Boudreaux, Big Chief of the Golden Eagles and a pioneer of bringing Black Masking Indian music to the world. Joseph began performing with the Wild Magnolias band at age ten and later became the frontman for Cha Wa, earning Grammy nominations for his work. In 2019, he and several other young New Orleans musicians formed The Rumble, aiming to create original music that carries the spirit and visual splendor of New Orleans while pushing its traditions into the future[2][3][4][5][8].

The Rumble's debut album, recorded live at the iconic Maple Leaf Bar, captures the vibrant energy and immersive experience of their performances. Their sound is described as a modern evolution of New Orleans funk, reminiscent of The Meters and The Neville Brothers, but with a contemporary edge and the unique visual spectacle of the Black Masking Indian tradition. The band is celebrated for writing and performing original songs that honor the legacy of New Orleans while remaining relevant to today's audiences[2][3][5][9].
