## Biography
George Bernard Worrell, Jr. was born on April 19, 1944, in Long Branch, New Jersey, and began playing classical music as a small child, developing a lifelong passion for music.[1][3] After studying at a conservatory and serving as musical director for singer Maxine Brown, Worrell met George Clinton, leader of the doo-wop group The Parliaments, and joined the collective that would become Parliament-Funkadelic.[1][2][5] Moving to Detroit, Michigan, Worrell officially joined the band after appearing on their 1970 debut album Funkadelic, where he served as keyboardist, arranger, and bandleader.[2]

Worrell became the primary architect of Parliament-Funkadelic's revolutionary sound during the 1970s, earning recognition as the second recipient of the Moog synthesizer and pioneering the use of the Minimoog bass synthesizer in funk music.[1][2] His work on landmark tracks like "Mothership Connection (Star Child)" (1975), "Give Up the Funk (Tear the Roof off the Sucker)" (1975), "Flash Light" (1978), and "Aqua Boogie" (1978) established him as a foundational figure in bridging American R&B with new wave, new age, and techno music.[1][2] His synthesizer lines became so widely sampled throughout the 1990s—particularly by Dr. Dre—that they became bedrock elements of hip-hop and the West Coast G-funk sound.[2]

After Parliament-Funkadelic's early 1980s hiatus, Worrell joined Talking Heads as a de facto member, appearing on their 1982 live album The Name of This Band Is Talking Heads and their 1983 breakthrough album Speaking in Tongues.[2] From the late 1980s onward, he became a prolific studio musician and visible member of the jam band scene, collaborating extensively with producer Bill Laswell, performing at major summer music festivals as "Bernie Worrell and the Woo Warriors," and appearing on albums by Jack Bruce, Keith Richards, the Pretenders, and Bootsy Collins.[2][5] Worrell passed away on June 24, 2016, leaving behind an unparalleled legacy as one of the most sampled and influential keyboardists in modern music history.[2]

## Fun Facts
- Worrell was the second recipient of the Moog synthesizer, created by Bob Moog, making him one of the earliest pioneers of synthesizer use in funk music.[1]
- He was a founding member of the CBS Orchestra when The Late Show with David Letterman launched in August 1993, playing lead synthesizer, though he departed that November once the orchestra added a horn section.[2]
- Worrell's synthesizer work became so widely sampled in hip-hop that he is among the most sampled musicians ever, with artists like Dr. Dre, Digital Underground, De La Soul, and DMX building entire tracks around his signature riffs.[2][5]
- He appeared in Talking Heads' concert film Stop Making Sense and was invited to perform with the band as part of their 2002 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction, despite never officially joining the group.[1][2]
