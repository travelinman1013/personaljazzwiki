## Biography
Linda Ronstadt, born on July 15, 1946, in Tucson, Arizona, emerged as a pivotal figure in the American music scene during the 1960s and 1970s. Growing up in a musically inclined family, Ronstadt was exposed to a diverse range of musical styles from an early age, including folk, country, bluegrass, and Mexican music. Her early musical endeavors included performing with her brother and sister as a trio, which laid the foundation for her future career. At the age of 18, Ronstadt moved to Los Angeles to pursue her music career, where she formed the Stone Poneys with Bobby Kimmel and Kenny Edwards. The group achieved moderate success with their hit single "Different Drum," written by Michael Nesmith of the Monkees, which reached number 13 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. This early success set the stage for Ronstadt's transition to a solo career in 1968, where she continued to build on her folk-rock roots while exploring new musical territories.

Ronstadt's solo career took off with the release of her album *Heart Like a Wheel* in 1974, which sold more than a million copies and established her as a leading figure in the music industry. Throughout the 1970s, she became known as the "Queen of Country-Rock" and the "First Lady of Rock," earning numerous accolades including 12 Grammy Awards. Her ability to adapt to various musical styles, from country and rock to jazz and Spanish-language classics, made her one of the most versatile and successful artists of her time. Ronstadt's collaborations with other artists, such as Dolly Parton and Emmylou Harris in the group Trio, further solidified her status as a musical icon. In addition to her musical achievements, Ronstadt also ventured into acting, starring in Broadway productions and films, and published her memoir *Simple Dreams* in 2013. Despite facing health challenges, including Parkinson's disease, which forced her to retire from singing in 2013, Ronstadt's legacy as a pioneering artist continues to inspire new generations of musicians.
