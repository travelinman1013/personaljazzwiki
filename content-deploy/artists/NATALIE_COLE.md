## Biography
Natalie Maria Cole (February 6, 1950 – December 31, 2015) was an American singer, songwriter, and actress, born in Los Angeles, California, to legendary jazz pianist and vocalist Nat King Cole and jazz singer Maria Hawkins Ellington. Immersed in music from an early age, Natalie initially pursued a degree in child psychology before ultimately following in her parents' footsteps. Her breakthrough came in 1975 with the release of her debut album 'Inseparable,' which featured the Grammy-winning hit 'This Will Be (An Everlasting Love).' She quickly established herself as a leading voice in R&B, becoming the first African-American recipient of the Grammy Award for Best New Artist.

Throughout the late 1970s and 1980s, Cole enjoyed a string of R&B and pop successes, including 'I've Got Love on My Mind,' 'Our Love,' and her cover of Bruce Springsteen's 'Pink Cadillac.' After overcoming personal struggles, she achieved her greatest commercial and critical triumph with the 1991 album 'Unforgettable... with Love,' a tribute to her father featuring a virtual duet on the classic 'Unforgettable.' The album spent five weeks at No. 1 on the pop charts, won six Grammy Awards, and sold over 14 million copies worldwide. Cole continued to record jazz and pop standards, earning further accolades and maintaining a respected presence in the music industry until her passing in 2015.

Natalie Cole's musical style blended R&B, soul, jazz, and pop, marked by her rich vocal timbre and emotional expressiveness. Her legacy is defined by her ability to bridge genres, honor her family's musical heritage, and inspire future generations of artists. Over her four-decade career, she released 23 studio albums, won nine Grammy Awards, and sold more than 30 million records worldwide.
