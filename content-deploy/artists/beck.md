## Biography
Beck Hansen, born Bek David Campbell on July 8, 1970, in Los Angeles, California, grew up immersed in music, discovering hip hop and folk in his teens. He began performing locally at coffeehouses and clubs, covering artists like Mississippi John Hurt with improvised lyrics, and even busked on city buses. In 1989, he moved to New York City with little money, joining the vibrant anti-folk scene in the East Village, which honed his surrealist, hyper-mundane lyrical style.[1][3][4]

Returning to Los Angeles in the early 1990s, Beck released independent albums like Golden Feelings (1993) and Stereopathetic Soulmanure (1994) before his breakthrough single 'Loser' became a global hit in 1994, peaking at number 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 and leading to his major-label debut Mellow Gold. His style evolved through genre-blending collages incorporating folk, funk, soul, hip hop, alternative rock, country, and psychedelia. Key albums include the award-winning Odelay (1996), the introspective Sea Change (2002) following a breakup, funk-driven Midnite Vultures (1999), and later works like Modern Guilt (2008) with Danger Mouse and Morning Phase (2014).[1][2][3][4]

Beck's legacy endures as a versatile innovator who bridged indie lo-fi with mainstream success, earning Grammy nominations and respect from peers like Tom Petty and Johnny Cash. He has released 14 studio albums, produced for others, and pursued eclectic projects like Record Club covers, maintaining a career marked by experimentation and critical acclaim.[3]
