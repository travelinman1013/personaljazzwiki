## Biography
Susanna Lee Hoffs, born January 17, 1959, in Los Angeles, California, is an American singer, songwriter, guitarist, and actress best known as a founding member of the Bangles. Raised in a creative household with a love for 1960s music, she studied art at UC Berkeley, where she was influenced by punk and new wave and formed her first band with David Roback. Returning to Los Angeles, Hoffs placed a want ad that led to meeting sisters Vicki and Debbi Peterson, and together they formed the Bangles in 1981. The group became a defining force in 1980s pop, blending jangly guitars, lush harmonies, and power pop sensibilities, and scored international hits with songs like 'Manic Monday,' 'Walk Like an Egyptian,' and 'Eternal Flame.'

After the Bangles' initial split in 1989, Hoffs embarked on a solo career, releasing several albums including 'When You're a Boy' (1991) and 'Susanna Hoffs' (1996), and collaborating with artists such as Matthew Sweet on the acclaimed 'Under the Covers' series. She also formed the faux-1960s band Ming Tea for the 'Austin Powers' films and contributed to numerous soundtracks. The Bangles reunited in 1999, continuing to tour and record, while Hoffs pursued solo projects and collaborations with notable musicians across genres. In 2023, she published her debut novel, 'This Bird Has Flown,' which received critical acclaim and was optioned for a film adaptation.

Hoffs' musical style is characterized by melodic power pop and jangle pop, drawing heavily from 1960s rock and pop influences. Her clear, expressive voice and knack for catchy songwriting have made her both a pop icon and a respected figure among peers, with a career spanning over four decades and a lasting impact on female-fronted rock bands.
