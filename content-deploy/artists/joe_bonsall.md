## Biography
Joseph Sloan Bonsall Jr. was born on May 18, 1948, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where he began singing at age four in church, influenced by his mother. As a teenager, he formed the Faith Four Quartet and befriended fellow gospel enthusiast Richard Sterban, later joining Sterban in the Keystones, a Northeastern gospel group. A born-again Christian in his early teens, Bonsall fell in love with Southern gospel quartet music after attending concerts by groups like the Blackwood Brothers and early Oak Ridge Boys, deciding at 15 to pursue a career in gospel singing while promoting shows in Buffalo, New York.[1][2][3][4][9]

In 1973, Bonsall joined The Oak Ridge Boys as tenor vocalist just before their transition from Southern gospel to country music, reuniting with Sterban who had joined in 1972. With Bonsall on high harmonies and leads for hits like 'Elvira,' 'Bobbie Sue,' and 'American Made,' alongside Duane Allen, William Lee Golden, and Sterban, the group achieved massive success, charting 34 Top 10 country singles from 1977-1991, including 17 No. 1s. They won ACM Awards in 1978, joined the Grand Ole Opry in 2011, and were inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2015.[1][3][4][8]

Beyond music, Bonsall was a prolific author, penning books like the 1997 children's series *The Molly Books*, 2003's *G.I. Joe and Lillie* (inspiring an Oak Ridge Boys song with millions of YouTube views), *An American Journey* (2004), *From My Perspective* (2010), and posthumous memoir *I See Myself* (2024). He retired from the Oaks in 2023 due to health issues and passed away on July 9, 2024, at age 76, leaving a legacy as the group's energetic sparkplug in gospel and country.[2][3][4]
