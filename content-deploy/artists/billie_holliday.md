## Biography
Billie Holiday, born Eleanora Fagan on April 7, 1915, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, endured a turbulent childhood marked by poverty and hardship, including time spent in reform schools and working in brothels. Dropping out of school early, she moved to New York City and began singing in Harlem nightclubs without formal musical training, adopting her stage name from actress Billie Dove. Discovered by producer John Hammond, she made her first recordings in 1933 with Benny Goodman and gained prominence through 1935 sessions with Teddy Wilson, producing hits like 'What a Little Moonlight Can Do,' which established her as a leading jazz vocalist.[1][3][5]

Holiday's career peaked in the 1930s and 1940s as she toured with Count Basie in 1937 and Artie Shaw in 1938, becoming the first Black woman to work with an all-white orchestra, though racial barriers forced her departure. Her signature song 'Strange Fruit' (1939), a haunting protest against lynching, became a civil rights milestone recorded with Commodore Records after label refusals. She recorded extensively with Wilson (95 sides), transitioned to Decca in 1944 for duets with Louis Armstrong, and later produced intimate albums like 'Lady in Satin' (1958) amid personal struggles with addiction. Her style—syncopated phrasing, improvisational tempo manipulation influenced by jazz instrumentalists, and emotional depth—redefined jazz and pop singing.[1][3][5][6]

Holiday's legacy endures through posthumous honors: four Grammy Awards, inductions into the Grammy Hall of Fame, National Rhythm & Blues Hall of Fame, and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (2000), where she is credited with changing jazz forever. Despite dying on July 17, 1959, in New York City from heart and liver failure linked to addiction, her influence on vocal improvisation and protest music remains profound.[1][2][4]
