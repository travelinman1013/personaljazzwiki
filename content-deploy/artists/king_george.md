## Biography
King George is a contemporary Southern soul and R&B singer-songwriter, celebrated for his smooth, nostalgic vocals and modern take on classic blues and soul. Born in Mississippi and raised in Hopkins, South Carolina, George was immersed in music from an early age—his father was a gospel singer and his mother a choir director. He began singing in church choirs at age five and picked up the guitar by eight, laying the foundation for his lifelong musical journey. 

Launching his career independently, King George gained early traction through grassroots touring and streaming platforms, quickly becoming a prominent figure in the Southern soul scene. His breakout single, "Keep On Rollin," released in 2022, exemplifies his blend of old-school blues, R&B, and funk, characterized by emotionally resonant storytelling and a party-centric, feel-good vibe. As president of Ace Visionz Productions, he maintains creative control over his work, connecting deeply with fans and amassing millions of streams. His music celebrates love, life, and Southern culture, and he has become a headliner on major tours such as The Blues Is Alright Tour, solidifying his legacy as a bridge between classic and contemporary soul music.
