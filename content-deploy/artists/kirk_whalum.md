## Biography
Kirk Whalum, born July 11, 1958 in Memphis, Tennessee, grew up in a musical family deeply rooted in the Baptist church. Initially drawn to drums, Whalum switched to saxophone during high school, quickly finding his passion for jazz after joining the school’s jazz program. He continued his musical education at Texas Southern University in Houston, where he absorbed the 'Texas Tenor' sound and began performing in local clubs, eventually forming his own band and developing his distinctive, soulful style[1][2][6].

Whalum’s career accelerated in the early 1980s when jazz pianist Bob James discovered him in Houston and invited him to record and tour, leading to a contract with Columbia Records. His debut album, 'Floppy Disk,' was released in 1985, followed by several successful albums and collaborations with major artists such as Larry Carlton, Al Jarreau, Luther Vandross, Barbra Streisand, Quincy Jones, and George Benson. Whalum’s saxophone solo on Whitney Houston’s 'I Will Always Love You' from 'The Bodyguard' soundtrack became iconic, propelling him to international fame[1][2][3][4].

Throughout his career, Whalum has released over 25 solo albums, including the chart-topping 'Cache' and the acclaimed 'Gospel According to Jazz' series. His music blends smooth jazz, gospel, and soul, reflecting his Memphis roots and commitment to cultural diversity. Whalum has earned 12 Grammy nominations and won a Grammy for Best Gospel Song in 2011, cementing his legacy as a leading figure in contemporary jazz and gospel music[2][4].
