## Biography
After extensive research across music databases, streaming platforms, news archives, social media, and general web search, there is currently no verifiable biographical information available about a musical artist named "Alice Antunes." No credible sources document her early life, place of origin, or career trajectory as a recording or performing musician.

The only consistent data point is the bare Spotify entry referenced in your prompt, which lists "Alice Antunes" with no genre, no known releases tied to press coverage, and a popularity score of 0, and there are no corroborating mentions in music press, label rosters, performance listings, or catalogues of emerging artists. In the absence of independent confirmation from reliable sources (such as music journalism, official artist pages, interviews, or reputable databases), it is not possible to construct an accurate narrative of her career, musical style, or legacy without speculation. To remain factual, she must be treated as an undocumented or extremely obscure artist whose public biography has not yet entered the documented record.
