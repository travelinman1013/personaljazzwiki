## Biography
The Blues Brothers are a fictional-but-real blues and soul band created by comedians John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd in the late 1970s, originally as a musical sketch for NBC’s Saturday Night Live.[3][4] Belushi (as “Joliet” Jake Blues) and Aykroyd (as Elwood Blues) first appeared in character on SNL in 1978, dressed in black suits, skinny ties, fedoras, and dark sunglasses, fronting a band of top rhythm-and-blues session players.[3][7] Their act grew out of the pair’s deepening passion for American blues: Belushi’s interest was sparked when he met bluesman Curtis Salgado while filming *Animal House* in Oregon, who introduced him to classic blues and soul records, a love that Aykroyd already shared.[1] The combination of comedy personas with an authentically powerful backing band quickly proved popular with television audiences.

On September 9, 1978, the Blues Brothers made their full-scale concert debut opening for Steve Martin at the Universal Amphitheatre in Los Angeles, recording the live album *Briefcase Full of Blues* during this run of shows.[2][7] Released later that year, the record reached number one on the charts and produced hit singles, showing that the project had evolved beyond a novelty into a successful recording and touring band.[3][4][7] Between 1978 and 1980 they issued two live albums, *Briefcase Full of Blues* (1978) and *Made in America* (1980), followed by the compilation *The Best of the Blues Brothers* in 1981, while also starring in John Landis’s 1980 film *The Blues Brothers*, which mixed slapstick comedy with elaborate musical set pieces featuring legends like Aretha Franklin and Ray Charles.[4] Musically, the group specialized in electrified Chicago-style urban blues and Memphis soul, powered by a crack rhythm section and horn line, and their high-profile success helped bring classic R&B to a new generation of rock and film fans.[4][5]

The sudden death of John Belushi in 1982 brought the original run of the Blues Brothers to a halt and cemented their status as a cultural phenomenon of a brief but intense era.[2][4] In 1989, core band members such as guitarist Steve Cropper, bassist Donald “Duck” Dunn, keyboardist Paul Shaffer, and saxophonist “Blue” Lou Marini re-formed as The Original Blues Brothers Band, reviving the repertoire for international tours and new recordings and further extending the brand’s legacy.[3][4] Dan Aykroyd continued to champion blues and soul by co-founding the House of Blues venue chain in 1992, which became one of the largest live music promoters in North America and a continuing platform for the music that inspired the Blues Brothers.[1] Decades after their debut, the band’s blend of comedy, cinema, and serious musicianship remains an influential gateway into blues and soul for mainstream audiences.[3][4]

## Fun Facts
- The idea for the Blues Brothers band was first discussed in the fall of 1973 at Aykroyd’s Toronto speakeasy, the 505 Club, where he and Belushi spent a night listening to blues records and imagining a band built around the music they loved.[5]
- The name “Blues Brothers” was suggested with help from Howard Shore, who would become Saturday Night Live’s music director and later an acclaimed film composer.[5]
- Their very first major concert as the Blues Brothers, opening for comedian Steve Martin at the Universal Amphitheatre in Los Angeles in 1978, doubled as the recording sessions for their debut album *Briefcase Full of Blues*.[2][7]
- Dan Aykroyd later co-founded the House of Blues venue chain in 1992, extending the Blues Brothers’ mission of celebrating and promoting American blues and roots music in clubs and theaters across North America.[1]
