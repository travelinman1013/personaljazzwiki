## Biography
McKinney’s Cotton Pickers were an influential American jazz band founded in Detroit, Michigan, in 1926 by drummer William McKinney, who expanded his earlier group, the Synco Septet, into a ten-piece ensemble[1]. Originally formed as the Synco Trio in Springfield, Ohio, in 1921, the band quickly gained regional popularity before relocating to Detroit and adopting the name McKinney’s Cotton Pickers after a memorable performance at a Detroit ballroom[2][3]. The band’s breakthrough came in 1927 when arranger and saxophonist Don Redman joined as musical director, bringing sophisticated arrangements and a polished ensemble sound that propelled them to national prominence[1][2]. Between 1928 and 1931, they recorded extensively for Victor Records, producing best-selling sides that blended hot jazz, swing, and popular dance music, appealing to both Black and white audiences[1][4]. Their style was marked by tight section work, inventive solos, and a repertoire that included both original compositions and creative treatments of contemporary hits[4]. Despite their commercial success, the band faced challenges from grueling touring schedules, management issues, and the onset of the Great Depression, leading to their gradual dissolution by 1934[3]. McKinney’s Cotton Pickers left a lasting legacy as one of the few Black regional bands to achieve national fame in the 1920s, influencing the development of swing and big band jazz[3].
