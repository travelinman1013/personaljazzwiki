## Biography
Kava Kon is a neo-exotica duo formed in 2004 in Detroit, Michigan by Nels Truesdell and Bob Kress. The project emerged as a creative escape from Detroit’s urban decay, with both members seeking to blend the vintage allure of mid-century exotica with modern electronic sensibilities. Bob Kress brought a background in jazz and classical music, incorporating a wide range of global instruments, while Nels Truesdell contributed a passion for electronic production and crate-digging for obscure vinyl.

Kava Kon’s debut album, 'Departure Exotica' (2005), introduced a sound that was both nostalgic and forward-looking, combining synthesizer-driven textures, field recordings, and live percussion to evoke cinematic, mysterious atmospheres. Their follow-up, 'Tiki for the Atomic Age' (2009), further developed their signature style, fusing elements of electronica, dub, and classic exotica. The duo’s music is characterized by lush soundscapes, vintage organs, and a seamless flow between tracks, often referencing Hollywood B-movie soundtracks, BBC Radiophonic Workshop audio, and the space-age pop of the 1950s and 60s.

Kava Kon’s innovative approach has helped revitalize the exotica genre for a new generation, extending its frontiers into the digital age while honoring its roots. Their work is celebrated for its moody, immersive qualities and for bridging the gap between retro lounge music and contemporary electronic experimentation.

## Fun Facts
