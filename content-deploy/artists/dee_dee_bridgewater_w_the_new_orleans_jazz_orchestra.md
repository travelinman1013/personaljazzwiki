## Biography
Dee Dee Bridgewater, born Denise Eileen Garrett on May 27, 1950, in Memphis, Tennessee, and raised in Flint, Michigan, is a renowned American jazz singer and actress. Her early exposure to jazz was influenced by her father, a jazz trumpeter, and her mother, who introduced her to Ella Fitzgerald's music. Bridgewater's career took off after joining the University of Illinois jazz band for a U.S. State Department tour of the Soviet Union in 1969. She then moved to New York City with her husband, trumpeter Cecil Bridgewater, and gained her first professional experience with the Thad Jones/Mel Lewis Jazz Orchestra from 1971 to 1974. This period was pivotal, as Thad Jones became a mentor, teaching her about music and encouraging her to develop her own style. Bridgewater's versatility extends beyond jazz; she has explored soul, show tunes, gospel, and Uptown R&B, and has had a successful acting career, including a Tony Award for her role in 'The Wiz' in 1975. In the 1980s, she relocated to Paris, where she re-committed to jazz and became a major draw in Europe. Bridgewater is a three-time Grammy Award winner and was named an NEA Jazz Master in 2017. Her musical style is characterized by her unique interpretations of jazz standards and her fearless approach to re-envisioning classics. Her legacy is marked by her contributions to jazz and her role as a pioneering female artist in a male-dominated field. Bridgewater has also been involved in various musical theater productions, including 'Lady Day' and 'Sophisticated Ladies,' and hosted the NPR radio show 'JazzSet with Dee Dee Bridgewater' from 2001 to 2014. Her collaboration with the New Orleans Jazz Orchestra, as seen in projects like 'Dee Dee's Feathers,' showcases her ability to blend jazz with other genres, creating a distinctive sound that resonates with audiences worldwide.
