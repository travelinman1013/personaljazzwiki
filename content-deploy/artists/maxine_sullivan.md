## Biography
Maxine Sullivan, born Marietta Williams on May 13, 1911, in Homestead, Pennsylvania, began her musical journey in her family's informal 'front porch orchestra,' where she sang and learned to play trumpet, valve trombone, and flugelhorn. She started professionally singing with her uncle's band, The Red Hot Peppers, and was discovered in the mid-1930s by Gladys Mosier, leading to introductions with pianist Claude Thornhill and her first recordings in 1937. Her breakthrough hit was a swinging version of the Scottish folk song 'Loch Lomond,' which defined her light, swinging style of jazz-infused folk tunes and propelled her to stardom, including appearances in films like *Going Places* (1938) with Louis Armstrong and stage roles such as *Swingin’ the Dream* (1939).[1][2][4]

Throughout the 1940s, Sullivan performed with bands led by her second husband John Kirby, Teddy Wilson, Benny Carter, and Jimmie Lunceford, and co-headlined the pioneering CBS radio show *Flow Gently, Sweet Rhythm* (1940-1941), one of the first nationally syndicated programs starring African American jazz artists. After pauses to work as a nurse and focus on family and community in the Bronx, she resumed performing in 1966 with her fourth husband Cliff Jackson and groups like the World's Greatest Jazz Band, continuing into the 1980s with albums such as *Maxine* (1982) and *Sings the Music of Burton Lane* (1985), earning Grammy nominations and a Tony nomination for *My Old Friends* (1979).[1][2][3]

Known for her gentle swing style and longevity spanning over 50 years, Sullivan influenced vocalists like Peggy Lee and preceded Ella Fitzgerald and Sarah Vaughan as a top 1930s jazz singer. She blended jazz with folk arrangements, performed at iconic venues like the Village Vanguard, and remained active until her death on April 7, 1987, leaving a legacy as 'The Queen' of jazz vocals.[1][2][4]
