## Biography
Janis Darlene Martin (March 27, 1940 – September 3, 2007) was an American rockabilly and rock and roll singer celebrated in the 1950s as **“The Female Elvis.”** Born in Sutherlin, Virginia, and raised in a musical family with a show-business–minded mother and a father and uncle who were amateur musicians, she began singing and playing guitar as a small child.[1][2] By age six she was performing publicly, and before ten she was winning talent contests and appearing on local radio in Danville and Martinsville, Virginia.[1][2] As a pre‑teen she moved into higher-profile country venues, becoming a regular on Richmond station WRVA’s Old Dominion Barn Dance, one of the largest country music radio shows in the United States, sharing bills with established country figures such as Ernest Tubb, the Carter Family, Sonny James, and Jean Shepard.[1][2] Although she was then marketed as a country and bluegrass act, her first love was rhythm and blues, and as early as age 13 she was already blending country with R&B material, including songs popularized by Ruth Brown, effectively creating an early form of rockabilly.[3][4]

In 1956 a demo she made for country singer Glen Thompson led to an audition with Steve Sholes at RCA Victor; at just fifteen she was signed to the label and recorded “Will You, Willyum,” backed with her self‑penned “Drugstore Rock and Roll.”[1][2] The record sold hundreds of thousands of copies and made the U.S. pop Top 40, propelling her onto national tours, TV appearances, and a regular role on Jim Reeves’s show for RCA.[1][2][5] RCA, eager to capitalize on Elvis Presley’s explosion, promoted her heavily as “The Female Elvis,” highlighting her energetic stage presence and driving rockabilly sound.[1][3] Despite the momentum, her career was abruptly curtailed when it emerged that she had secretly married a U.S. serviceman and become pregnant; amid 1950s industry conservatism RCA dropped her, and by the early 1960s she largely withdrew from professional music to focus on family life, making only a brief recording return on Palette Records.[1][3][5] In the 1970s she re‑emerged on the rockabilly revival circuit with her band the Variations, touring especially in Europe, where her 1950s sides had become cult classics and where she was embraced as a pioneering woman in a male‑dominated style.[1][3] Her legacy today places her alongside Wanda Jackson and Brenda Lee as one of the key female architects of rockabilly, known for fusing country roots with R&B drive and for demonstrating that a teenage girl from rural Virginia could rock as hard as any of her male contemporaries.[3][5]

Musically, Martin’s style was a hybrid of the country and bluegrass she grew up performing and the rhythm and blues recordings she loved, particularly those of Ruth Brown.[2][3][4] On WRVA’s Old Dominion Barn Dance she pushed boundaries by using electric instruments and covering R&B repertoire such as Brown’s “Mama, He Treats Your Daughter Mean,” at a time when such material was unusual on conservative country programs.[3][4] In the studio, especially on her Nashville sessions with top RCA producer Chet Atkins, she developed a hard‑driving rockabilly sound heard on key sides like “Drugstore Rock and Roll,” “Bang Bang,” “Barefoot Baby,” “Love Me to Pieces,” and “Blues Keep Calling,” records that later critics have praised as some of the most exciting hillbilly‑rock fusion to come out of 1950s Nashville.[1][3] Although commercial obstacles, gender bias, and personal circumstances kept her from sustained chart success, the reissue and rediscovery of her recordings from the 1970s onward cemented her reputation as a trailblazer who opened space for later generations of female rock, country, and rockabilly performers.[3][5]

## Fun Facts
- RCA Victor marketed Janis Martin as **“The Female Elvis Presley,”** a nickname reportedly approved by Elvis’s manager Colonel Tom Parker, to highlight her energetic rockabilly style alongside their new male star.[1][3]
- She wrote “Drugstore Rock and Roll” herself as a teenager; issued as the B‑side to “Will You, Willyum,” it became an enduring rockabilly classic and her signature song.[1][2]
- As a young teen on WRVA’s Old Dominion Barn Dance, Martin defied the show’s conservative norms by performing R&B songs associated with Black artists, backed by electric instruments, at a time when such material was unusual on country radio.[3][4]
- Her promising RCA career was abruptly halted after the label discovered she had secretly married a U.S. serviceman and become pregnant while still being promoted as a teenage star, leading to her being quietly dropped despite strong sales.[1][3]

(Shared bills and live radio appearances on WRVA’s Old Dominion Barn Dance and other barn‑dance style programs.) [Early 1950s]
- [[chet_atkins|Chet Atkins]] - RCA’s top Nashville producer and guitarist who supervised and shaped many of her most acclaimed rockabilly recordings. (Nashville sessions for RCA Victor, including tracks like “Love Me to Pieces,” “Bang Bang,” and “Blues Keep Calling.”) [Mid–late 1950s]
