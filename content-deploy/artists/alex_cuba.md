## Biography
Alex Cuba, born Alexis Puentes in Artemisa, Cuba, grew up deeply immersed in Cuban music, guided by his father Valentin Puentes, a well-known musician and educator. From an early age, Alex was encouraged to focus on instruments, particularly the guitar and bass, developing formidable skills and a profound understanding of traditional Cuban sounds. As a teenager, he began to absorb American genres such as blues, jazz, rock, and funk, which would later inform his eclectic musical voice.

In 1999, after marrying Canadian Sarah Goodacre, Alex relocated to Smithers, British Columbia, Canada. There, he forged a path as an independent artist, blending Latin folk, trova, pop, and global influences into a style that is both rooted and innovative. His career has been marked by critical acclaim, including multiple Latin Grammy Awards, a Grammy Award for Best Latin Pop Album (for 'Mendó' in 2022), and Juno Awards. Alex is celebrated for his emotive melodies, bilingual lyrics, and his ability to connect with audiences regardless of language. He has collaborated with a wide range of artists, from Nelly Furtado to Pablo Milanés, and remains a respected figure in both Latin and Canadian music scenes.

Alex Cuba's legacy is defined by his commitment to artistic freedom and cross-cultural creativity. He has played a pivotal role in bringing Latin music to new audiences in Canada and beyond, all while maintaining his independence from major labels. His work continues to inspire musicians with its fusion of tradition and innovation, and his story exemplifies the possibilities of global musical dialogue.
