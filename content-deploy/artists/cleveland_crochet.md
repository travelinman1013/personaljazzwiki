## Biography
Cleveland Crochet was a pioneering Cajun fiddler and bandleader, born on January 30, 1919, in Jennings, Louisiana, and raised in Lake Charles from 1927 onward. One of nine children, he was introduced to music early by his industrious mother, who organized her children into a family band for local dances. Crochet famously built his first fiddle from a cigar box and tree branch at age twelve, using horsehair for strings, reflecting both his resourcefulness and deep connection to traditional Cajun music.[1][6]

In the 1950s, Crochet formed the Hillbilly Ramblers, later known as the Sugar Bees, performing throughout Louisiana and East Texas. His blend of dancehall Cajun with a rock & roll backbeat culminated in the 1960 single "Sugar Bee," which became the first Cajun song to enter the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at #80 and reportedly selling over a million copies. Despite this success, Crochet continued to work as an ironworker to support himself, as he did not receive royalties for his hit due to label practices of the era. His recordings from 1954 to 1963 for labels like Folk-Star, Khoury's, Goldband, Lyric, and Swallow are considered foundational in the evolution of Cajun and swamp pop music.[1][2][3]

Crochet's legacy is cemented by his induction into the Cajun Music Hall of Fame and his influence on the national recognition of Cajun music. He passed away on November 28, 2011, at the age of 92, remembered for his role in bringing the vibrant sounds of southwest Louisiana to a broader audience and inspiring generations of Cajun musicians.[1][4][9]
