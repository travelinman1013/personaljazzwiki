## Biography
Eva Correia José Maria, professionally known as Evinha, was born on September 17, 1951, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. She began her musical journey as a child, joining her siblings in the acclaimed vocal group Trio Esperança in 1961. The group became a prominent act during the Jovem Guarda era, blending Brazilian pop with influences from American doo-wop and rock, and enjoyed significant success throughout the 1960s.

In 1968, Evinha launched her solo career after a standout performance of 'Cantiga por Luciana' at the 4th International Song Festival. Her solo work throughout the 1970s and beyond showcased her versatility, with hits like 'Teletema' and 'Como Vai Você' that drew on MPB (Música Popular Brasileira), bossa nova, samba, soul, and jazz. Evinha's music is characterized by her emotive vocals and her ability to bridge traditional Brazilian styles with contemporary pop. She toured internationally, collaborated with family and prominent musicians, and celebrated 50 years of solo work in 2019 with an album dedicated to Guilherme Arantes' songs. Despite being less internationally recognized than some contemporaries, Evinha is regarded as a foundational figure in modern Brazilian pop and MPB, with a legacy of innovation and heartfelt performance.
