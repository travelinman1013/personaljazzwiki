## Biography
Tiny Tim, born Herbert Butros (later Buckingham) Khaury on April 12, 1932, in New York City, was an American singer, ukulele player, songwriter, and self-described musical archivist best known for his 1968 hit cover of “Tiptoe Through the Tulips.”[4][3] The son of a Lebanese father and Polish-Jewish mother, he became fascinated early with popular songs from the 1890s through the 1930s and largely taught himself guitar, violin, mandolin, and eventually ukulele, the instrument that became his trademark.[4][3][2] After struggling in school and repeating his sophomore year twice, he dropped out to pursue music full-time, working odd jobs—including as a messenger at MGM’s New York office—while honing a distinctive stage persona built around vintage repertoire, a high falsetto, and eccentric appearance.[4][3][1]

Through the 1950s and early 1960s, Tiny Tim performed around New York under various aliases such as Vernon Castle, Texarkana Tex, Emmett Swink, and “Larry Love, the Singing Canary,” often at Times Square’s Hubert’s Museum and in Greenwich Village clubs, including the lesbian-run Page 3.[4][1][3] It was his manager George King who began billing him as “Tiny Tim,” an ironic nod to his tall stature, and he gradually built a cult following with a repertoire mixing obscure Tin Pan Alley songs, 1930s–40s torch songs sung in a surprisingly strong baritone, and novelty “duets” where he alternated between baritone and falsetto.[4][5] Discovered by Reprise Records executive Mo Ostin at New York club The Scene, Tiny Tim was signed and paired with producer Richard Perry; his debut album *God Bless Tiny Tim* (1968) and its single “Tiptoe Through the Tulips” reached the U.S. Top 20 and sold over 200,000 copies, propelling him to national fame, frequent TV appearances (including *The Tonight Show*), and large concert audiences.[4][2][5]

Although his chart success was brief, Tiny Tim remained active for decades, releasing follow-up albums such as *Tiny Tim’s 2nd Album* (1968) and *For All My Little Friends* (1969), the latter earning a Grammy nomination, and continuing to record for smaller labels through the 1970s and 1980s.[4][2] His television visibility waned after the late 1960s, but he worked consistently in clubs, casinos, and even circuses, with highlights including a widely praised 1970 performance at the Isle of Wight Festival before an estimated 600,000 people—remarkable for being done without electric instruments.[4][2] In later years he cultivated a modest comeback through radio appearances (notably on *The Howard Stern Show*) and niche recordings, maintaining a devoted fan base attracted to his encyclopedic knowledge of early popular song and unapologetically idiosyncratic style, until he died on November 30, 1996, after suffering a heart attack onstage in Minneapolis, Minnesota.[4][3]

## Fun Facts
- The stage name “Tiny Tim” was chosen by his manager George King after Tiny Tim followed a little person (“midget”) act on a bill; the name was meant to be humorously ironic because he was over six feet tall.[4]
- His falsetto breakthrough came when he sang “You Are My Sunshine” in a local talent show using the high voice he had recently discovered, a moment that helped define his later signature sound.[4][1]
- Tiny Tim’s 1968 wedding to his first wife, Vicki Budinger (“Miss Vicki”), was broadcast live on *The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson* and reportedly drew around 35 million viewers, making it one of the most-watched TV events of its time.[2]
- He performed at the massive 1970 Isle of Wight Festival to an estimated 600,000 people and was noted in the British press for ‘stealing the show’ despite using no electric instruments.[4]

## Musical Connections

### Mentors/Influences
- [[rudy_vallée|Rudy Vallée]] - Major stylistic influence on Tiny Tim’s crooned baritone delivery and his affinity for early 20th‑century popular song. (General influence on Tiny Tim’s interpretations of 1920s–30s torch songs and Tin Pan Alley repertoire rather than a specific collaborative project.) [Influence developed from Tiny Tim’s youth through his professional career (1950s–1990s).]

### Key Collaborators
- [[mo_ostin|Mo Ostin]] - Record executive at Reprise Records who signed Tiny Tim after seeing him perform at New York club The Scene, effectively launching his major-label career. (Oversaw signing and release of the album *God Bless Tiny Tim* (1968) and related singles including “Tiptoe Through the Tulips.”) [Late 1960s (particularly 1967–1968).]
- [[richard_perry|Richard Perry]] - Record producer who worked closely with Tiny Tim on his major-label debut for Reprise Records. (Produced *God Bless Tiny Tim* (1968), which contained Tiny Tim’s hit version of “Tiptoe Through the Tulips.”) [Circa 1967–1968.]
- [[george_king|George King]] - Manager who helped shape Tiny Tim’s professional identity and branding, including the adoption of the “Tiny Tim” stage name and extensive auditioning around Greenwich Village. (Guided early 1960s club work and auditions, including performances at Hubert’s Museum and Page 3; instrumental in rebranding him from earlier stage names to “Tiny Tim.”) [Early to mid‑1960s.]

### Artists Influenced
- [[contemporary_ukulele_revivalists_and_noveltyoutsider_musicians_representative_influence|Contemporary ukulele revivalists and novelty/outsider musicians (representative influence)]] - Tiny Tim’s blend of ukulele, falsetto, and deep knowledge of pre‑war popular music has been cited in retrospectives as a touchstone for later generations of ukulele players and performers who embrace eccentric, ‘outsider’ personas, even though specific named protégés are not well documented in primary sources. (Influence is most associated with his hit “Tiptoe Through the Tulips” and the album *God Bless Tiny Tim*, which reintroduced obscure Tin Pan Alley material to later audiences.) [Influence extends post‑1968 through the late 20th century and into the 21st‑century ukulele and retro‑cabaret scenes.]
