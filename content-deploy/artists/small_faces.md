## Biography
The Small Faces formed in East London in 1965 when Steve Marriott, a former child actor working at the J60 Music Bar, met bassist Ronnie Lane. Together with drummer Kenney Jones and keyboardist Jimmy Winston (soon replaced by Ian McLagan), they became one of the most influential British mod bands of the 1960s. The band's name reflected both their physical stature—all members were shorter than average—and their status as respected figures in the mod subculture. Drawing inspiration from American R&B and soul music, they quickly achieved commercial success with eight UK Top 10 singles, including their 1966 No. 1 hit "All Or Nothing," and reached the pinnacle of their creative output with the 1968 psychedelic rock masterpiece album "Ogdens' Nut Gone Flake," which spent six weeks at No. 1 on the UK charts.

Despite their artistic achievements, Steve Marriott felt the band had run its course by late 1968 and walked off stage on New Year's Eve at The Alexandra Palace, frustrated that they weren't being taken seriously as musicians and unable to properly reproduce their sophisticated material live. He departed to form Humble Pie with Peter Frampton. The remaining members—Ronnie Lane, Kenney Jones, and Ian McLagan—were joined by Rod Stewart (vocals) and Ron Wood (guitar), formerly of the Jeff Beck Group, transforming into "The Faces" (dropping "Small" as the new members were taller). The Faces became known for their rowdy, ramshackle pub-rock style throughout the early 1970s, though the band eventually fractured when Rod Stewart's solo career overshadowed the group, leading to their breakup in 1975.

The Small Faces' legacy encompasses their pioneering fusion of mod culture with psychedelic rock and their influence on subsequent generations of British rock musicians. Their catalog—ranging from stomping R&B to whimsical pop to psychedelia—demonstrated remarkable versatility and creativity. Band members went on to significant careers: Kenney Jones became drummer for The Who following Keith Moon's death in 1978, Ron Wood joined the Rolling Stones, and Ian McLagan performed with Bob Dylan and the Rolling Stones. The band's impact on proto-punk, psychedelic rock, and northern soul remains substantial, with their music continuing to influence artists across multiple genres.

## Fun Facts
- The band's name 'Small Faces' had dual meaning: all four original members were shorter than average height, and 'Face' was a mod subculture term for the most highly regarded members of the mod community.
- Steve Marriott walked off stage mid-performance on New Year's Eve 1968 at The Alexandra Palace in London, yelling 'I quit' because he felt the band wasn't being taken seriously as musicians and couldn't properly reproduce their sophisticated material in live performances.
- When Rod Stewart and Ron Wood joined the remaining Small Faces members to form The Faces, they dropped 'Small' from the band name because both new members were significantly taller than the original lineup, making the name no longer accurate.
- The band members' post-Small Faces careers were remarkably successful: Kenney Jones became The Who's drummer, Ron Wood joined the Rolling Stones, and Ian McLagan performed with Bob Dylan and the Rolling Stones, demonstrating the caliber of musicianship within the original group.
