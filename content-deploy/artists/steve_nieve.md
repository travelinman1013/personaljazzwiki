## Biography
Steve Nieve, born Steven Nason on February 19, 1958, in Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire, England, studied composition and piano at the Royal College of Music. At age 19 in 1977, he successfully auditioned as keyboardist for Elvis Costello and the Attractions, rising to fame in the late 1970s with his distinctive keyboard styling that defined the band's sound on albums like This Year's Model (1978), Armed Forces (1979), Imperial Bedroom (1982, featuring his orchestrations), Blood and Chocolate (1986), and All This Useless Beauty (1996).[1][4][7] The Attractions were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2003, and Nieve continued with Costello in the Imposters, earning Grammy nominations in 2002 and 2004 for Cruel Smile, Delivery Man, and Monkey to a Man, plus a win in 2019 for Look Now.[1]

Nieve's musical style blends classical training with rock, pop, and opera, evident in his solo works such as Keyboard Jungle (1983), the opera Welcome to the Voice (2000, recorded 2007 with libretto by Muriel Teodori), Mumu (2000), Raining Somewhere (2003), Windows (2004), Lazy Point (2010), ToGetHer (2014, a song cycle with various vocalists), and Fuji~Rama (2019).[1][3] He has collaborated extensively across genres, including with the Brodsky Quartet, Paul McCartney, Anne-Sofie von Otter, Chet Baker, Robert Wyatt, Allen Toussaint, and Burt Bacharach, while residing in France with his wife and collaborator Muriel Teodori.[1][3]

Nieve's legacy endures through his integral role in Costello's career over four decades, his own compositions bridging classical and popular music, and performances with his Steve Nieve Band featuring Ajuq and guests like Glen Tilbrook at events such as Fuji Rock Festival (2009, 2014). He also tours a piano-and-stories show, Steve Nieve Plays Elvis Costello.[1]
