## Biography
Louie Gonnie is a Diné (Navajo) and Zuni descendant, born at Antelope Springs in the Navajo Nation. Raised in a family deeply connected to the traditions and spiritual practices of the Native American Church, Gonnie began singing at the age of five under the guidance of his father and uncles. His maternal clan is Todích’íi’nii (Bitter Water People), and his paternal clan is Nát’oh Dine’é Táchii’nii (Tobacco People/Red Streak running in the Water Clan), reflecting a rich heritage that grounds his artistic identity. A major influence in his life was his grandfather, Haastíín Gonnie, a respected medicine man whose teachings on humanity and healing continue to guide Louie’s spiritual and musical journey.[1][2][5][6]

Gonnie’s career developed organically from private recordings shared among family and friends to widely distributed albums, after he discovered bootleg copies of his music circulating at powwows and gatherings. This prompted him to record and release music professionally, collaborating with Canyon Records and producer Stephen Butler. Gonnie’s work is characterized by spiraling melodies and harmonies, all composed in his native Diné language, and is noted for its meditative, contemplative quality. His albums, such as 'Songs of the Sacred Circle' and 'Black Cedar Hills,' blend traditional peyote songs with his own artistic vision, honoring both ancestral legacy and personal creativity. Gonnie’s music is now recognized for its spiritual depth and its role in preserving and evolving Native American Church music traditions.[2][3][5]

As a third-generation singer, Louie Gonnie’s legacy lies in his dedication to maintaining traditional values while innovating within the genre. His music is used in ceremonies and has become a staple within the Native American Church community, inspiring both listeners and fellow musicians. Gonnie’s approach to composition—bending melodies and integrating poetic elements—distinguishes him as a gentle advocate for his culture and a bridge between generations.[1][2][5]
