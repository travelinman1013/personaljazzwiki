## Biography
Elizabeth Clark Phair, known professionally as Liz Phair, was born on April 17, 1967, in New Haven, Connecticut, and raised primarily in the Chicago area[1][2][3]. After graduating from Oberlin College in 1990, Phair briefly attempted to launch her music career in San Francisco before returning to Chicago, where she began recording lo-fi demo tapes under the name Girly-Sound[1][3][5]. These tapes garnered attention in the local alternative scene and led to a contract with Matador Records.

Phair's debut album, 'Exile in Guyville' (1993), was a critical sensation, celebrated for its raw, emotionally honest, and often sexually explicit lyrics, unconventional guitar work, and unique song structures[1][2]. The album is widely regarded as a landmark in 1990s indie rock and has been ranked among Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time[1][2]. She continued to evolve her sound with subsequent albums such as 'Whip-Smart' (1994) and 'Whitechocolatespaceegg' (1998), earning Grammy nominations and expanding her audience. In the 2000s, Phair shifted toward a more pop-oriented style with her self-titled 2003 album, which brought mainstream success but polarized critics[1][2][3].

Throughout her career, Phair has remained a prominent voice in alternative and indie rock, noted for challenging gender norms and exploring themes of female autonomy and sexuality. She has sold over three million records worldwide and has also contributed to television as a composer, earning an ASCAP award for her work[1]. Her legacy endures as a pioneering figure who inspired a generation of women in rock music.
