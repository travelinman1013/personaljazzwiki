## Biography
Hazmat Modine is a genre-defying band founded in 1998 by Wade Schuman in New York City. Schuman, the group’s primary songwriter, vocalist, and harmonica player, shaped the band’s creative direction, drawing deeply from the American roots tradition while infusing it with global influences. The band’s sound is a vibrant blend of early blues, Hokum jug band, swing, New Orleans R&B, and even Jamaican rocksteady, layered with elements from Central Asian, Caribbean, West African, jazz, rock, folk, and country music. Their instrumentation is as eclectic as their influences, featuring tuba, accordion, trumpet, flugelhorn, trombone, saxophones, piccolo, duduk, banjo, mandocello, steel guitar, and more, creating a rich and textured sonic palette.

Hazmat Modine’s career has been marked by relentless exploration and international touring, performing at major festivals across Europe, the Americas, Australia, and Asia. Their debut album, 'Bahamut' (2007), established them as innovators in the world music scene, and subsequent releases such as 'Box of Breath' have continued to push boundaries. The band’s performances are known for their energy, inclusiveness, and the seamless integration of diverse musical traditions. Schuman describes their mission as getting to the core of what makes American music work, emphasizing its roots in the immigrant experience and its organic evolution through cultural exchange.

The legacy of Hazmat Modine lies in their ability to bridge the gap between American roots music and global sounds, creating a musical dialogue that is both timeless and forward-looking. Their work has been praised for its originality and its capacity to condense human experience into compelling, Tin Pan Alley-inspired song formats, making them a unique fixture in the contemporary music landscape.
