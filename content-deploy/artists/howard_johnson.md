## Biography
Howard Williams Johnson, born November 28, 1956, in Miami, Florida, is an American soul and disco singer best known as the founder of the group Niteflyte. Johnson began his musical journey performing in local Miami bars and clubs, where his talent soon attracted the attention of Sandy Torano, a guitarist and producer with connections to the Commodores and Phyllis Hyman. This pivotal meeting led to the formation of Niteflyte in 1977 under Ariola Records, launching Johnson's recording career and establishing his presence in the post-disco and funk scenes.[1][2][3][4]

After two albums with Niteflyte, Johnson signed a solo contract with A&M Records. His debut solo album, 'Keepin' Love New' (1982), produced by Kashif, Paul Laurence Jones, and Morris Brown, featured the hit single 'So Fine,' which reached No. 1 on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart. Johnson continued to build his reputation with subsequent albums 'Doin' It My Way' (1983), produced by The System, and 'The Vision' (1985), with contributions from Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. His smooth vocal style, blending soul, disco, urban, and boogie influences, resonated strongly in both the U.S. and UK markets.[1][2]

Johnson's career extended through collaborations with artists such as Donna Allen and Regis Branson, notably forming the duo Johnson & Branson in 1989. While the 1990s saw a slowdown in his recording activity, Johnson returned in the 2000s with new releases and reissues, maintaining a legacy as a respected figure in post-disco and funk. His work continues to be celebrated for its melodic richness and dancefloor appeal.[1][2]
