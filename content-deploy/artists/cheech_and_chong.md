## Biography
Cheech & Chong, the comedy duo of Richard 'Cheech' Marin and Tommy Chong, formed in the late 1960s in Vancouver, British Columbia, where Chong owned a nightclub called the Shanghai Junk and ran an improvisational troupe named City Works. Marin, born in South Central Los Angeles and in Vancouver as a political refugee, joined Chong after tiring of manual labor jobs, and the pair honed a musical comedy act that evolved into spacy pothead raps after audiences favored their stoner humor over music.[1][2][3][4] They debuted with their self-titled 1971 LP, featuring sketches like 'Waiting for Dave' and 'Trippin' in Court,' which went gold, followed by the massive hit Big Bambu in 1972, packaged in giant rolling paper, and the Grammy-winning Los Cochinos in 1973 with 'Basketball Jones.'[1][2]

Transitioning to film, their 1978 breakout Up in Smoke grossed over $100 million, cementing their status as counterculture icons lampooning the drug culture, with subsequent hits like Nice Dreams and Still Smokin'.[1][2][4] As 1970s hedonism faded into Reagan-era conservatism, their act lost steam; after 1984's The Corsican Brothers, they split, releasing a final album Get Out of My Room in 1985. Marin found success in films like Desperado and TV's Nash Bridges, while Chong became a cannabis activist; they reunited briefly in 1997 on Nash Bridges and for a 2008 tour.[1][2]

Their legacy endures as voices of the hippie generation, with six gold albums, four Grammy nominations, and one win, influencing comedy by blending improvisation, music, and marijuana-themed satire, while individually thriving in entertainment.[1][2][3]
