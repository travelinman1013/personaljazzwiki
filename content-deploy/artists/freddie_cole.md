## Biography
Freddie Cole, born Lionel Frederick Cole on October 15, 1931, in Chicago, Illinois, emerged from a family deeply rooted in music—his elder brother was the legendary Nat 'King' Cole. Freddie began his professional recording career in 1952 with the single 'The Joke’s on Me' and gradually built a reputation performing in Manhattan clubs while supplementing his income with commercial jingle work. A classically trained pianist who studied at Juilliard, Cole developed a distinctive style that, while reminiscent of his brother’s, was marked by a raspier, jazzier vocal timbre and phrasing more akin to Frank Sinatra or Billie Holiday.

Cole’s career flourished internationally in the 1970s, especially in Europe, where he recorded several albums and expanded his repertoire to include songs in multiple languages. Settling in Atlanta in 1972, he led a touring quartet and became a fixture on the jazz circuit, admired for his suave, elegant vocals and sophisticated piano work. Despite not achieving the same level of mainstream fame as his brother, Freddie Cole was widely respected among jazz musicians and fans, earning Grammy nominations and induction into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame. His discography includes notable albums such as 'I’m Not My Brother, I’m Me' (1991), 'Merry Go Round' (2000), and 'Rio de Janeiro Blue' (2001), each showcasing his unique blend of jazz, blues, and vocal artistry.

Cole’s legacy is defined by his consistency, professionalism, and ability to connect with audiences worldwide. He mentored younger musicians in his bands and inspired countless vocalists with his understated yet deeply expressive approach. Freddie Cole passed away on June 27, 2020, in Atlanta, leaving behind a rich legacy as one of the most maturely expressive male jazz singers of his generation.
