## Biography
Georgie Auld (born John Altwerger on May 19, 1919, in Toronto, Canada) was a self-taught jazz tenor saxophonist, clarinetist, and bandleader whose career spanned the swing, bebop, and big band eras. After moving with his family to Brooklyn, New York, in 1929, Auld received his first saxophone and quickly became a prodigy, performing in his family's saloon and forming his own band by age 13. Inspired by the legendary Coleman Hawkins, he switched from alto to tenor saxophone in 1935, a pivotal decision that shaped his expressive style.[1][3][4]

Auld's professional breakthrough came as a teenager when he joined Bunny Berigan's orchestra, followed by a prominent stint with Artie Shaw's band, where he even led the group during Shaw's absences. Throughout the 1940s and 1950s, Auld collaborated with top jazz figures including Benny Goodman, Erroll Garner, Dizzy Gillespie, and Billy Eckstine, and led his own successful big bands such as Georgie Auld and His Orchestra. His playing was marked by a bold, swinging approach that bridged the gap between the big band tradition and the emerging bebop style. Auld also ventured into acting, appearing on Broadway and in films, most notably as a bandleader and technical consultant in Martin Scorsese's 'New York, New York' (1977).[2][3][5]

Auld's legacy rests on his adaptability and influence across jazz genres, his leadership in both swing and early bebop ensembles, and his role as a connector between generations of jazz musicians. He remained active in music and entertainment until his death in Palm Springs, California, on January 8, 1990.[3][4]
