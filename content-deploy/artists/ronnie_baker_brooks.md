## Biography
Ronnie Baker Brooks, born Rodney Dion Baker on January 23, 1967, in Chicago, Illinois, is a prominent figure in modern blues and soul blues. The eldest son of legendary bluesman Lonnie Brooks, Ronnie was immersed in the Chicago blues tradition from an early age, making his stage debut at age nine alongside his father.
