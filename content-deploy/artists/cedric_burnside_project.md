## Biography
Cedric Burnside, born August 26, 1978, in Memphis, Tennessee, was raised in North Mississippi's Marshall and Benton Counties, immersing himself in the multigenerational Hill Country blues tradition as the grandson of legendary bluesman R.L. Burnside and son of blues drummer Calvin Jackson. By age 13, he was touring on drums with his grandfather's band, quickly establishing himself as a drummer, guitarist, singer, and songwriter in the distinctive North Mississippi sound, characterized by extended riffs akin to talking drums fused with raw vocals that blend ancestral stories with contemporary Black American experiences.[1][2][3]

Burnside's career took off in the early 2000s with contributions to albums like Richard Johnston's *Foot Hill Stomp* (2002) and *Official Bootleg #1* (2004), followed by collaborations including *The Record* (2006) with uncle Garry Burnside as Burnside Exploration, and the *Juke Joint Duo* and *Two Man Wrecking Crew* (2007-2008) with Lightnin' Malcolm. He formed the Cedric Burnside Project around 2008-2011, releasing key albums like *The Way I Am* (2011), *Hear Me When I Say* (2013), and the Grammy-nominated *Descendants of Hill Country* (2015) with guitarist Trenton Ayers. Solo breakthroughs came with *Benton County Relic* (2018, Grammy-nominated), *I Be Trying* (2021), and *Hill Country Love* (2024), produced by Luther Dickinson in a makeshift wooden juke joint, earning him multiple Blues Music Awards, a 2021 National Heritage Fellowship, and the 2024 Mississippi Governor's Art Award.[1][2][3][4]

Burnside's style evolves the Hill Country blues into its electric second generation, incorporating funk, rock, soul, and hip-hop influences while preserving raw authenticity. Despite personal losses—brother Cody in 2012 and father in 2015—he continues as a torchbearer, touring globally, acting in films like *Black Snake Moan* (2006), and mentoring the next generation through nine albums and collaborations that ensure the genre's future.[1][2][5][6]
