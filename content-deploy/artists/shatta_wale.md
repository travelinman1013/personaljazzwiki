## Biography
Charles Nii Armah Mensah Jr., known professionally as Shatta Wale, was born on October 17, 1984, in Accra, Ghana. He initially adopted the stage name Bandana after completing senior high school, releasing his debut single "Bandana from Ghana" in 2004, which gained significant airtime in the Ghanaian music industry. However, his breakthrough came in 2009 when he changed his stage name to Shatta Wale, and his career reached new heights in 2013 with the release of "Dancehall King," a song that became a massive hit and earned him the Artist of the Year award at the 2014 Ghana Music Awards.

Shatta Wale is a reggae-dancehall artist known for his street-wise appeal and controversial public persona, often employing hip-hop culture's tradition of lyrical battles and social media stunts to drive publicity. His musical style spans multiple genres including hiplife, azonto, afrobeats, and afropop, demonstrating versatility beyond his primary dancehall identity. He owns his own record label, SM 4 (For) Lyf Records, and has expanded into acting, appearing in films such as "Never Say Never," "The Trial of Shatta Wale," and "Shattered Lives." His best-known singles include "Dancehall King," "My Level," and "Taking Over," and he gained international recognition through collaborations such as "Already" from Beyoncé's *The Lion King: The Gift* featuring Major Lazer.

Throughout his career, Shatta Wale has accumulated numerous accolades and recognition, including being ranked number 38 on E.tv's "Top 100 Most Influential Ghanaians" in 2014 and appearing on the chart annually thereafter. He was recognized as the "Most Influential Musician" on social media in 2017 and won 11 awards at the 2019 3Music Awards ceremony. Beyond music, he made history as the first Ghanaian to organize a digital concert on YouTube, the Faith Concert, during the COVID-19 pandemic. His influence extends to politics, with Ghana's two major political parties using his hits "Mahama Paper" and "Kakai" in their 2016 campaign strategies.
