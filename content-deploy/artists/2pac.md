## Biography
Tupac Amaru Shakur, born Lesane Parish Crooks on June 16, 1971, in East Harlem, Manhattan, emerged as one of hip-hop's most influential and controversial figures. Born to Black Panther Party members Afeni Shakur and Billy Garland, Tupac was renamed after Túpac Amaru II, an 18th-century Peruvian revolutionary, reflecting his parents' activist legacy. His early life was marked by instability—his mother struggled with crack cocaine addiction in the 1980s, forcing the family to relocate multiple times from New York to Baltimore in 1984, and finally to Marin City, California in 1988. Despite these hardships, Tupac discovered creative outlets through the Baltimore School for the Arts, where he studied acting, poetry, jazz, and ballet, performing in Shakespeare productions and developing the artistic sensibility that would define his later work.

Tupac's music career began in earnest in 1988 when he joined Digital Underground as a roadie and background dancer before becoming a rapper. Under the mentorship of poetry teacher Leila Steinberg, who became his manager, he honed his craft and was signed by Atron Gregory. His debut solo album, 2Pacalypse Now (1991), immediately established him as a central figure in West Coast hip-hop, distinguished by his politically conscious lyrics that addressed systemic inequality, police brutality, and social injustice. His musical style synthesized old school hip-hop, gangster rap, and g-funk, creating a distinctive sound that resonated with audiences seeking authentic narratives of street life and social commentary. Throughout the early 1990s, Tupac became known for his prolific output, powerful delivery, and willingness to tackle controversial subjects, earning him a Spotify popularity rating of 80 and cementing his status as the King of Hip-Hop.
 n
Despite his meteoric rise, Tupac's life was cut short when he was killed in a drive-by shooting in 1996 at age 25. His legacy, however, remains immense—he fundamentally shaped West Coast hip-hop's trajectory, influenced generations of rappers, and demonstrated that rap could serve as a vehicle for social activism and artistic expression. His work continues to be studied, sampled, and celebrated, making him one of the most commercially successful and culturally significant rappers of all time.

## Fun Facts
- Tupac was born exactly one month after his mother, Afeni Shakur, was acquitted of over 150 charges of conspiracy against the United States government in the New York Panther 21 trial, making his birth a symbolic moment of freedom for his activist mother.
- While living in Baltimore, Tupac's first rap performance was inspired by a tragic incident when one of his friends was shot while playing with a gun—this accident motivated him to write and perform his first rap about gun control.
- Tupac wrote an English class paper titled 'Conquering All Obstacles' in which he expressed his artistic vision, stating 'our raps, not the sorry story raps everyone is so tired of,' demonstrating his early commitment to authentic, meaningful hip-hop.
- The block where Tupac lived in Baltimore (3955 Greenmount Ave) was renamed Tupac Shakur Way after his death, honoring his connection to the community that shaped his artistic development.
