## Biography
Victoria Spivey, born October 15, 1906, in Houston, Texas, emerged from a musically gifted family—her father led a string band and her sisters were also professional singers. Spivey began performing as a child, playing piano at local parties and later accompanying silent films in Dallas. By her teens, she was active in Houston and Galveston’s vibrant club scene, sometimes working with blues luminaries like Blind Lemon Jefferson. Her breakthrough came in 1926 with the hit 'Black Snake Blues,' launching a prolific recording career that spanned four decades and included collaborations with jazz and blues greats such as Louis Armstrong, King Oliver, and Lonnie Johnson[1][2][3].

Spivey’s style was marked by a hard, nasal vocal delivery and a penchant for 'mean' blues, often exploring somber or risqué themes. She was also a talented songwriter, penning classics like 'Dope Head Blues' and 'Organ Grinder Blues.' Beyond recording, Spivey was a versatile performer—appearing in vaudeville, on stage, and in the landmark 1929 film 'Hallelujah!' She weathered the Great Depression by adapting her performances and later became a key figure in the 1960s blues revival, co-founding Spivey Records in New York with Len Kunstadt. Through her label, she championed both established and emerging artists, including a young Bob Dylan, and maintained her influence on the blues scene until her death in 1976[1][2][4].

The 'Chicago Four' refers to a studio ensemble that accompanied Spivey on certain recordings, notably for Vocalion Records in the mid-1930s. While the individual members varied, these sessions exemplified the fusion of classic blues with the evolving Chicago sound, further cementing Spivey’s legacy as a bridge between early country blues and urban blues traditions[5].
