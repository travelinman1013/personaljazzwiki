## Biography
J.Views and Rhye are two distinct musical artists who have collaborated together, most notably on the single 'Love Affair.' J.Views is the stage name of Jonathan Dagan, born February 16, 1982, in Israel. He is a two-time Grammy-nominated musician, producer, and art director based in New York. Dagan began his career in the early 2000s, releasing his debut album 'Muse Breaks' in 2005 after initial demos with vocalist Noa Lembersky. His music is characterized by multilayered production, blending electronic, indie, and pop elements with nostalgic samples and analog synths. J.Views is known for innovative fan engagement, such as the 'Work In Progress' and 'DNA Project,' which allowed fans to participate in the album creation process, resulting in works like 'rivers and homes' and '401 Days.'[1][6]

Rhye is the R&B musical project led by Canadian singer and multi-instrumentalist Mike Milosh, originally formed as a duo with Danish producer Robin Hannibal. Milosh, a classically trained cellist from Toronto, began his solo career under the name Milosh before forming Rhye in 2010. Rhye gained international attention with the release of sensual singles 'Open' and 'The Fall,' followed by the critically acclaimed debut album 'Woman' in 2013. The project is noted for its sophisticated, emotive blend of R&B, soul, and pop, with Milosh's androgynous vocals drawing comparisons to Sade and The xx. After Hannibal's departure, Rhye evolved into a collective centered around Milosh and a live band, releasing subsequent albums 'Blood,' 'Spirit,' and 'Home.'[2][3][4][5]

The collaboration between J.Views and Rhye, such as on 'Love Affair,' showcases their shared affinity for lush, detailed production and emotionally resonant songwriting. Both artists have left a legacy of pushing genre boundaries and fostering intimate connections with their audiences through innovative creative processes.
