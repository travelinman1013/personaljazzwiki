## Biography
American Aquarium is an alternative country band formed in 2006 in Raleigh, North Carolina by BJ Barham, who emerged as the band's primary songwriter and frontman. Originally from Reidsville, North Carolina, Barham founded the group while studying political science and history at NC State University, deriving the band's name from the Wilco song "I Am Trying to Break Your Heart." For their first seven years, American Aquarium toured relentlessly—playing around 250 shows annually across 13 countries and 46 states—while building a modest but devoted fanbase, though achieving little commercial recognition or critical acclaim during this period.

The band's breakthrough came in 2012 with the album "Burn. Flicker. Die.," produced by Jason Isbell (formerly of Drive By Truckers), which was originally intended to be their final release. The album garnered considerable critical praise and marked a turning point after years of touring without significant industry attention. Barham described it as "the equivalent of flicking the light switch" for the band's career trajectory. However, the increased demands of touring and recording, combined with typical rock and roll pressures, led to a breaking point in 2017 when all band members departed, leaving Barham as the sole remaining member.

Despite this setback, Barham rebuilt American Aquarium with a new lineup featuring Shane Boeker on electric guitar, Rhett Huffman on organ and piano, Neil Jones on pedal steel guitar, Ryan Van Fleet on drums and percussion, and Alden Hedges on bass guitar. The reconstituted band released "Things Change" in 2018 on New West Records, followed by "Lamentations" in 2020. For nearly two decades, American Aquarium has pursued what Barham describes as "that rare form of rock-and-roll that's revelatory in every sense," becoming known for consistently sold-out shows and a candid, emotionally resonant songwriting style that explores themes of struggle, perseverance, and Southern heritage.
