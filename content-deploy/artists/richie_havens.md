## Biography
Richard Pierce Havens, known as Richie Havens, was born on January 21, 1941, in Brooklyn, New York, to a Black family. He began his musical journey in the 1950s as a teenager singing doo-wop with a group called the Last Men and later formed his own group by age 16. At 20, he moved to Greenwich Village in 1961, initially drawing portraits for tourists by day and immersing himself in the folk scene by night, where he taught himself guitar to accompany his poetry performances at clubs like Café Wha?[1][4][5][6].

Havens's career took off after signing with Bob Dylan's manager Albert Grossman and releasing his debut album *Mixed Bag* in 1966 on Verve Forecast, featuring tracks like 'Handsome Johnny' (co-written with Louis Gossett Jr.) and a cover of Dylan's 'Just Like a Woman.' His breakthrough came at Woodstock in 1969, where as the opening act he performed for nearly three hours due to delays, delivering an iconic set that included an improvised 'Freedom' and catapulted him to stardom[1][2][3]. He founded his own label Stormy Forest, releasing hits like his cover of George Harrison's 'Here Comes the Sun' from *Alarm Clock* (1970), which reached Billboard's Top 30, and continued with albums like *Stonehenge* and *The Great Blind Degree*. His style blended folk, soul, and gospel with rhythmic open tunings and passionate vocals[1][2][3][5].

In later decades, Havens branched into acting, voiceovers for commercials (e.g., Amtrak, Coca-Cola), TV appearances on *Sesame Street* and *The Tonight Show*, and his 2000 autobiography *They Can't Hide Us Anymore*. He remained a touring folk icon until his death from a heart attack on April 22, 2013, at age 72, leaving a legacy as a Woodstock symbol and enduring voice for peace and folk music[1][2][3][8].

## Fun Facts
- Havens improvised the song 'Freedom'—his best-known track—on stage at Woodstock when he ran out of material and had to extend his set due to performer delays[1][2][3].
- He drew portraits of tourists in Greenwich Village, earning up to $300 a night in 1959 (when rent was $50/month), before focusing on music[1][4].
- His Woodstock set lasted nearly three hours in his memory, but recordings show about 50 minutes; he was the only act ready when the festival started late[1][3].
- Havens sang doo-wop as a 13-year-old in 1954 with 'The Last Men,' inspired by Cold War-era doom, marking his earliest musical foray[4][6].
