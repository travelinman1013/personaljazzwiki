## Biography
Eddie Floyd, born June 25, 1937, in Montgomery, Alabama, is a seminal figure in American soul and R&B, best known for his enduring association with Stax Records and the classic hit "Knock on Wood." Raised between Alabama and Detroit, Floyd's early exposure to both Southern gospel and Detroit's burgeoning R&B scene shaped his unique musical sensibility. His formative years included a transformative stint at the Alabama Industrial School for Negro Children, where he received his first formal music training and sang in the choir, experiences that would deeply influence his later artistry.

Floyd's professional career began in Detroit in the 1950s, where he co-founded The Falcons, one of the first soul groups, alongside future stars like Wilson Pickett and Mack Rice. The Falcons achieved national success with hits such as "You're So Fine" and "I Found a Love." After moving to Memphis, Floyd became a key songwriter and solo artist at Stax Records, collaborating with Steve Cropper and Booker T. & the MG's to create a string of hits that defined the Southern soul sound of the 1960s and 1970s. Beyond his own recordings, Floyd penned songs for other major artists and continued to perform with ensembles like the Blues Brothers Band and Bill Wyman’s Rhythm Kings, solidifying his legacy as a versatile and influential soul man.
