- The band performed at the Krewe du Vieux Doo festival on February 4, 2012, following Walter 'Wolfman' Washington's Afunkalypse performance, demonstrating their integration into New Orleans' festival and cultural scene.[1]
- Ryan Scully, the band's singer/guitarist, has maintained a 15+ year collaboration with drummer Mike Andrepont, who also plays with R. Scully's Rough Seven, showing the deep musical bonds formed within the New Orleans music community.[3]
