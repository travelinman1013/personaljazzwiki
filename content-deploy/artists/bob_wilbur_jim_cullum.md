## Biography
“Bob Wilbur, Jim Cullum” refers to a documented collaboration between American clarinetist and saxophonist **Bob Wilber** and American cornetist and bandleader **Jim Cullum Jr.**, rather than to a single artist. Bob Wilber (1928–2019) was a prominent traditional jazz musician and arranger known for his work in the idioms of early jazz and swing, while Jim Cullum Jr. (1941–2019), born in Dallas and raised in San Antonio, was a leading cornetist and preservationist of classic Dixieland and 1920s–30s hot jazz.[1][2][3] Their paths converged in projects devoted to historically rooted jazz, including recorded tributes to pioneers such as Jelly Roll Morton, where Wilber’s historically informed arranging and reed work met Cullum’s robust, Bix- and Armstrong-inspired cornet style.[1][2][5]

Jim Cullum Jr. bought his first cornet from a pawn shop at age fourteen and began playing in small jazz ensembles in high school in San Antonio, often joined by his father, reedman Jim Cullum Sr.[1][2] Immersed in his father’s 78‑rpm records, he absorbed the music of Louis Armstrong and Bix Beiderbecke and developed a lifelong commitment to pre‑bop jazz.[2] In 1962 he co‑founded the Happy Jazz Band with his father, drawing heavily on 1920s and 1930s hot jazz, and in 1963 they opened The Landing, one of the first businesses and the first nightclub on San Antonio’s River Walk.[1][2][3] After his father’s death in 1973, he renamed the group the Jim Cullum Jazz Band and led it as an all‑acoustic, seven‑piece traditional ensemble. Under his leadership, the band recorded extensively, performed at major venues such as Carnegie Hall, Preservation Hall, the White House, and the Kennedy Center, and became internationally known through the long‑running public‑radio series *Riverwalk Jazz* (1989–2012).[1][2][3]

Within this traditional jazz world, Bob Wilber and Jim Cullum intersected through recordings and concert appearances that focused on classic repertoire, including collaborations documented on releases such as *The Music of Jelly Roll Morton* that pair Wilber with Cullum’s circle of traditionalists.[5] Cullum’s musical style remained rooted in early jazz—lyrical, melodic cornet lines, clear articulation, and historically grounded repertoire—while Wilber was celebrated for his meticulous re‑creation and extension of early jazz reed styles. Together and separately, they influenced a generation of musicians who pursued historically oriented jazz performance, taught at jazz workshops and festivals (Cullum and his band served on the faculty of the Stanford Jazz Workshop from 1993 to 2005), and helped keep classic jazz in the public ear through concerts, club residencies, and radio broadcasts.[1][2]
