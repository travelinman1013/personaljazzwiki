## Biography
Bixiga 70 is a Brazilian instrumental collective formed in October 2010 in the Bixiga neighborhood of São Paulo, named after both their recording studio at 70 Rua 13 de Maio (Traquitana studio, founded by guitarist Cris Cabello) and Fela Kuti's Africa 70 band. Emerging from the vibrant Paulista scene of the 2000s, the original 10 members—coming from punk, reggae, rock, and electronic backgrounds—united around a democratic manifesto emphasizing equal creative input, no vocals to highlight individual instrumental talents, and a fusion of African and Brazilian sounds, deeply rooted in the historical African influences on Brazilian music via slavery.[1][2] Their early albums, including the self-titled debut, *Ocupa!* (2013, released amid political unrest), and others, were recorded live at Traquitana without overdubs, capturing their raw, groove-driven energy.[1][2]

The band's music blends **afrobeat**, samba, funk, Zamrock psychedelia, and traditional Brazilian rhythms, prioritizing percussion-heavy grooves and horn sections, with influences filtered through Brazilian artists like Gilberto Gil before direct Afrobeat exposure. They gained international recognition for festive live shows and political activism, participating in the 2013 Music for Democracy movement alongside Tom Zé and others, and resisting Bolsonaro's rise and COVID disruptions, which led to lineup changes around 2020.[1][2][6] Albums like *Quebra Cabeça* (2018) and *Vapor* (2023) showcase evolving sounds with new recruits, maintaining their collective ethos amid Brazil's turbulent politics.[1][2]

Bixiga 70's legacy lies in spearheading Brazil's afrobeat scene, sharing stages with Tony Allen and Seun Kuti, and embodying communal resistance and musical hybridity, rebuilding post-pandemic with fresh members like drummer Simone Sou and percussionist Valentina Facury to sustain their vibrant, politically charged performances.[1][2][6]

## Fun Facts
- The band's studio at Rua 13 de Maio 70 was once a famous '60s-'70s bar and live venue called Teleco-teco da Paróquia.[4]
- They recorded an Afro-Brazilian chant 'Deixa Gira Girá' (homage to storm goddess Iansã) just before a flood nearly destroyed the studio, attributing it to mystical protection.[4]
- Participated in the 2013 'Music for Democracy' occupation of São Paulo's Largo da Batata park for eight days with street performances and citizenship debates.[1]
- During COVID and Bolsonaro era, the band nearly disbanded with member departures, but Lula's 2022 victory spurred a rebuild with new recruits.[1]
