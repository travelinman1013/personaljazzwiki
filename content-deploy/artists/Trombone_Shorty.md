## Biography
Troy Andrews, known as Trombone Shorty, was born on January 2, 1986, in New Orleans, Louisiana, into a family steeped in the city’s musical traditions[1]. He began playing trombone at age four, inspired by his brother James, and quickly became a local sensation, leading his own band by age six and performing at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival as a child[1]. Growing up in the Tremé neighborhood, Andrews was immersed in brass band culture, participating in second line parades and absorbing a wide range of influences—jazz, funk, rock, hip-hop, and soul—that would later define his genre-blending style[1][3]. He attended the New Orleans Center for Creative Arts (NOCCA), a prestigious arts high school, and graduated from Warren Easton High School in 2004[1].

Andrews’ career took off in his teens as a member of the Stooges Brass Band, and he gained wider recognition after joining Lenny Kravitz’s horn section for a world tour in 2005[1]. He formed Trombone Shorty & Orleans Avenue, a band known for its high-energy fusion of brass band rhythms, rock dynamics, and improvisational jazz[3]. Andrews has released multiple acclaimed albums, including Grammy-nominated Backatown (2010) and Blue Note Records’ Parking Lot Symphony (2017)[1][3]. Beyond performing, he is a dedicated music educator, founding the Trombone Shorty Foundation to nurture young musicians and preserve New Orleans’ brass band heritage[3][4]. His legacy lies in revitalizing traditional New Orleans sounds for contemporary audiences and inspiring a new generation of musicians.
