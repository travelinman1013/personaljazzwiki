## Biography
Native New Yorker Sam Dillon is a highly regarded jazz saxophonist, composer, and educator who has emerged as one of the most in-demand musicians of his generation. His early introduction to jazz came at age 9, inspired by the theme from the Pink Panther, and he began studying saxophone shortly thereafter. Dillon played his first professional gig at just 14 years old with legendary trombonist Al Grey, setting the stage for a prolific career. He earned his Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in Jazz Performance from SUNY Purchase College in 2009, followed by an Artist Diploma from The Juilliard School in 2016, making him one of the few musicians to hold three degrees in music performance.

Dillon’s career is marked by extensive work as both a bandleader and sideman, with over 40 studio recordings and performances at major venues worldwide, including Carnegie Hall, Lincoln Center, and the Blue Note. He is recognized for his powerful tenor saxophone voice and has released several acclaimed albums, such as 'Out In The Open' (2018), 'Force Field' (2019), and 'It Takes One To Know One' (2022, co-led with Andrew Gould). Dillon’s musical style blends bebop, hard bop, and contemporary jazz, reflecting his deep roots in the New York jazz tradition. He is also a dedicated educator, serving as Jazz Director at USDAN Summer Camp for the Arts and teaching at Juilliard’s MAP program.
