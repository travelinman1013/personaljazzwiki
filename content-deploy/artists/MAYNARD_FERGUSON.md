## Biography
Maynard Ferguson was born on May 4, 1928, in Verdun, Quebec, Canada, into a musical family and began playing piano and violin at an early age. He discovered the trumpet at age nine and quickly demonstrated prodigious talent, soloing with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation Orchestra by age eleven and leading warm-up bands for jazz greats like Count Basie and Duke Ellington by his teens. After studying at the French Conservatory of Music in Montreal, Ferguson moved to the United States in the late 1940s, joining the Boyd Raeburn and Jimmy Dorsey orchestras before gaining national attention as a featured soloist with Stan Kenton's big band, renowned for his remarkable high-register trumpet playing.

In 1956, Ferguson moved to New York to lead the Birdland Dream Band, assembling an all-star ensemble with arrangements by top jazz writers such as Quincy Jones and Johnny Mandel. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, he led several innovative big bands, often serving as a launching pad for young jazz talent. Ferguson's musical style evolved over the decades, blending jazz, bebop, rock, funk, and even Indian influences, most famously achieving mainstream success with his hit recording of "Gonna Fly Now" (the theme from Rocky), which earned him a Grammy nomination and brought jazz to new audiences. He was also a dedicated educator, inspiring countless young musicians through clinics, performances, and his own bands.

Ferguson's legacy is defined by his technical virtuosity, especially his ability to play in the trumpet's extreme upper register, his role as a bandleader and mentor to generations of jazz musicians, and his willingness to embrace new musical styles. He remained active as a performer and recording artist until his death in 2006, leaving an indelible mark on the jazz world and continuing to influence brass players and big band leaders worldwide.
