## Biography
Laura Elizabeth Arabosa Izibor was born on 13 May 1987 in Dublin, Ireland, to an Irish mother, Trish, and a Nigerian father, Saul, as the fourth of five children. Her passion for music ignited after performing 'When You Believe' by Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston in drama class; she began songwriting at age 13 and self-taught piano at 14. At 15, she won the RTÉ 2FM Song Contest with 'Compatible', gaining airplay, meeting manager Edison Waters, and featuring in an RTÉ documentary, which propelled her early career.[1][2]

At 17, Izibor signed with Jive Records, dropped out of school, and later moved to Atlantic Records after a label dispute, following mentor Steve Lunt to New York. Her debut album *Let the Truth Be Told* (2009) debuted at #2 on the Irish Albums Chart, #100 in the UK, and #27 on the US Billboard 200. Lead single 'From My Heart to Yours' peaked at #25 on US Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs, while 'Shine' reached #21 in Ireland and appeared in films like *The Nanny Diaries*. She opened for artists including Aretha Franklin, India.Arie, Estelle, Maxwell, and John Legend, earned a 2006 Meteor Music Award as the first unsigned nominee, and received further nominations at MOBO, BET, and Choice Awards. Her style blends R&B, soul, and pop, showcasing her skills as a singer-songwriter, pianist, producer, and arranger.[1][2][3]

Post-2009, Izibor released the EP *The Brooklyn Sessions Vol. 1* (2012) with tracks like 'Gracefully' and planned a second album *Love, Learn, Live* that remained unreleased by 2012. She contributed soundtracks to TV shows like *One Tree Hill* and films including *P.S. I Love You*, *When in Rome*, and *A Little Bit of Heaven*, cementing her multifaceted legacy in music and media despite a quieter period after 2012.[1][2][4]
