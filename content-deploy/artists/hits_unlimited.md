## Biography
Hits Unlimited is not a distinct musical artist or band but the title of a 1995 greatest hits compilation album by the Belgian-Dutch Eurodance act 2 Unlimited, marking the final release featuring original front members Ray Slijngaard and Anita Doth before their departure in 1996[1][2]. Founded in 1991 in Antwerp, Belgium, by producers Jean-Paul De Coster and Phil Wilde, 2 Unlimited initially operated as a studio project without live performers until Slijngaard, a Dutch rapper, and Doth, a Dutch vocalist from Amsterdam, were brought on board following their contributions to early tracks[1][3]. The group achieved massive worldwide success from 1991 to 1996 with high-energy Eurodance hits like 'No Limit,' 'Get Ready for This,' and 'Twilight Zone,' selling 18 million records globally and becoming staples in sports events, particularly in the US NBA and NHL[1][3][4].

The *Hits Unlimited* album compiled 13 prior singles plus three new tracks, including 'Do What's Good for Me' and 'Jump for Joy,' and was certified gold in the Netherlands while charting internationally, though it fueled rumors of the group's split[1][2]. Post-1996, 2 Unlimited continued with new vocalists and producers De Coster and Wilde, releasing further material like the 1998 album *II*, but never recapturing early peak success; reunions occurred in 2009 and later, with ongoing activity as of 2022 featuring Slijngaard and new vocalist Michèle Karamat Ali[1]. The *Hits Unlimited* era encapsulated 2 Unlimited's classic Eurodance style—characterized by rapid beats, rap verses, and soaring female vocals—leaving a legacy as a defining act of 1990s dance music[2][3].
