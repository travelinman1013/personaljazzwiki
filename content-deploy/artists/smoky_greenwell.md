## Biography
Smoky Greenwell, born on July 4, 1951, in Michigan and raised in Delaware, is a renowned American blues harmonica player, saxophonist, singer, and songwriter. He was educated in Spain and Tennessee, and began his musical journey in earnest in the mid-1970s, learning harmonica by sitting in with legendary blues musicians such as Furry Lewis, Piano Red, and Mose Vincent. Greenwell's early career included session work at the iconic Sun Studios in Memphis and a move to Nashville in the 1980s, where he gained national attention as a member of the Blues Co-Op alongside Allman Brothers guitarist Warren Haynes. His long-standing collaboration with Allman Brothers keyboardist Johnny Neel also began during this period.[1][3][6]

In 1981, Greenwell relocated to New Orleans after a performance at the Old Absinthe Bar, immersing himself in the city's vibrant music scene. Over the next three decades, he became a fixture in New Orleans blues, fronting his own band and performing with numerous local legends such as Snooks Eaglin, Marc Adams, and Eddie Bo. Greenwell is perhaps best known for his role as Lee Oskar's replacement in the seminal band WAR, where he performed with Harold Brown, BB Dickerson, and Howard Scott. His musical style blends traditional blues with elements of jazz, rock, and Louisiana roots music, reflecting the diverse influences of his adopted home.[1][2][4][7]

Greenwell's legacy includes a prolific recording career, with over a dozen solo albums and a reputation as a first-call session player. He is also recognized as an educator, having produced a widely used harmonica course and mentored countless musicians. His contributions to blues harmonica and the New Orleans music community have made him a respected figure among peers and fans alike.[1][2][3]
