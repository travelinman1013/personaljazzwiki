## Biography
Stan Freberg (born Stanley Friberg on August 7, 1926, in Pasadena, California) was an American satirist, voice actor, singer, comedian, radio personality, and pioneering advertising creative director.[1][5][7] The son of a Baptist minister of Swedish descent, he grew up in the Los Angeles area during the golden age of network radio, absorbing shows and music that would later fuel his sophisticated, often absurdist style of parody.[4][5] After graduating high school, he went straight to Hollywood, quickly landing work at Warner Bros. Cartoons, where he voiced characters such as Pete Puma and one of the Goofy Gophers, and then joined the U.S. Army Special Services during World War II, serving in the Medical Corps from 1945 to 1947.[1][2][3]

In the late 1940s and early 1950s, Freberg became a central figure in American audio satire. He first gained wide attention on television as a performer on the influential puppet show "Time for Beany," produced by Bob Clampett, and soon began recording for Capitol Records’ spoken‑word division.[1][3][5] His breakthrough single "John and Marsha" (1951), a deadpan soap‑opera parody performed entirely with two names, became an unexpected hit and was followed by a string of best‑selling comedy records, including "St. George and the Dragonet," "Sh‑Boom," "Green Christmas," and the concept album "Stan Freberg Presents the United States of America."[1][5][6] In 1957 he hosted "The Stan Freberg Show" on CBS Radio, a lavishly produced sketch‑and‑music series that used many of his Capitol collaborators and helped solidify him as the leading satirical voice on the airwaves, even as network radio comedy was declining.[1][5]

From the 1960s onward, Freberg extended his influence beyond records and radio into television and advertising. As the head of his own agency, Freberg Limited, he introduced sharp, self‑aware humor and satire into national campaigns for clients such as General Motors and Mellon Bank, with several of his commercials later archived by major cultural institutions and honored at festivals.[1][2] Musically, his work blended big‑band and pop orchestrations with densely written verbal humor, parodying contemporary pop, rock ’n’ roll, and Americana with a mix of affection and biting wit.[1][4][5] Freberg’s legacy is felt in modern musical and media satire: he demonstrated that comedy records could be conceptually ambitious, helped shape the tone of humorous advertising in the television era, and inspired generations of satirists and musical parodists before his death on April 7, 2015, in Santa Monica, California.[1][2]

## Fun Facts
- Freberg refused to accept advertising sponsorships from alcohol and tobacco companies on principle, a stance that limited opportunities for his CBS radio show but reflected his strong ethical views.[1]
- "John and Marsha," his 1951 hit parody of soap operas, uses only two spoken words—the characters’ names—but became a chart success and a classic of minimalistic audio comedy.[1][5][6]
- His album "Stan Freberg Presents the United States of America, Volume 1" is widely regarded as one of the most ambitious comedy concept albums ever made and was later recognized by the U.S. Library of Congress’s National Recording Preservation Board.[1][5]
- Beyond comedy records, Freberg became so influential in advertising that some of his radio and TV commercials were preserved in major museums, and he even won top prizes at international festivals for his ad work.[2]
