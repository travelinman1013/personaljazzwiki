## Biography
Jack Teagarden (born Weldon Leo Teagarden on August 20, 1905, in Vernon, Texas) was an American jazz trombonist, singer, and bandleader whose career spanned from the 1920s until his death in 1964. Raised in a musical family—his mother was a pianist for silent films and his siblings all became professional musicians—Teagarden began playing trombone at age eight and performed with his mother in local theaters. His early exposure to ragtime and jazz in Texas and Nebraska shaped his musical sensibility and technical innovation.

Teagarden moved to New York in the late 1920s, quickly establishing himself as a leading trombonist with Ben Pollack's band, and later collaborating with jazz luminaries such as Louis Armstrong, Benny Goodman, Bix Beiderbecke, and Paul Whiteman. He was known for his unique, supple trombone style—eschewing the traditional 'tailgate' approach in favor of trumpet-like phrasing and inventive techniques, such as using a glass as a mute. His blues-inflected vocals and relaxed, swinging phrasing set him apart as both an instrumentalist and a singer. Teagarden led his own bands, played with Paul Whiteman's orchestra (1933–1938), and was a key member of Louis Armstrong's All-Stars (1946–1951), touring internationally and recording extensively.

Widely regarded as one of the greatest jazz trombonists, Teagarden's innovations helped elevate the trombone from a supporting to a solo instrument in jazz. His soulful playing and distinctive voice influenced generations of musicians, and he remained an active performer until his death from bronchial pneumonia in New Orleans on January 15, 1964. Teagarden is remembered as a creative force in early jazz and a beloved figure in American music history.
