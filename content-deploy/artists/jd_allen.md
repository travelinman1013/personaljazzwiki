## Biography
JD Allen (born John Daniel Allen III on December 11, 1972, in Detroit, Michigan) is an acclaimed American jazz tenor saxophonist and composer. Raised in Detroit, Allen was immersed in the city’s rich musical culture from an early age and initially pursued classical clarinet before switching to saxophone. By age twenty, he secured his first major professional opportunity with legendary jazz vocalist Betty Carter, a formative experience that propelled him to New York City and into the heart of the jazz world.[1][2][7]

Allen’s career has been marked by both versatility and a distinctive, hard-driving style. He has performed and recorded with jazz luminaries such as George Cables, Ron Carter, Jack DeJohnette, Frank Foster, Butch Morris, and Wallace Roney, as well as with contemporary peers like Cindy Blackman, Meshell Ndegeocello, and Dave Douglas.[1][4] In 2008, Allen formed a celebrated trio with bassist Gregg August and drummer Rudy Royston, releasing a series of critically acclaimed albums that showcased his penchant for concise, blues-infused compositions and stream-of-consciousness improvisation.[2][6] His work often explores themes of the African-American experience, as evidenced in albums like 'Americana Vol. 2.'[5]

Allen is recognized for his enigmatic, elegant, and emotionally resonant approach to the tenor saxophone, earning accolades from DownBeat, JazzTimes, and NPR, and being hailed by The New York Times as a leading voice in contemporary jazz.[3][4] His legacy is defined by a relentless commitment to artistic growth, a prolific recording output, and a profound influence on the modern jazz saxophone tradition.
