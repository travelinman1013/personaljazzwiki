## Biography
Milton Cardona (1944–2014) was a renowned Puerto Rican percussionist, vocalist, and high priest of the Santería religion, celebrated for his profound influence on Latin jazz and Afro-Cuban music. Born in Mayagüez, Puerto Rico, and raised in New York City, Cardona began his musical journey studying violin for seven years before shifting his focus to bass and eventually percussion, inspired by the vibrant street jams of New York and the music of Mongo Santamaría. His deep connection to both Puerto Rican and Afro-Cuban traditions shaped his unique style, blending Yoruba rhythms, Santería chants, and jazz with elements of doo-wop and salsa.

Cardona rose to prominence in the 1970s, performing and recording with salsa legends such as Willie Colón and Héctor Lavoe, and later collaborated with a wide array of artists including Paul Simon, David Byrne, Herbie Hancock, and Rubén Blades. He was a master of the batá drums, sacred to the Santería religion, and was instrumental in introducing these rhythms to secular and popular music contexts. His 1986 album 'Bembé' is considered a landmark in Afro-Cuban folkloric music, authentically capturing the spirit of Santería ceremonies. Over his prolific career, Cardona appeared on more than 700 recordings, spanning salsa, Latin jazz, world music, and experimental genres.

A revered figure in both musical and spiritual communities, Cardona was known for his versatility, technical mastery, and deep respect for tradition. His legacy endures through his recordings, his role in popularizing Afro-Caribbean percussion in the United States, and his influence on generations of musicians who continue to draw inspiration from his artistry and dedication.
