## Biography
Richard Slaid Cleaves, born June 9, 1964, in Washington, D.C., and raised in South Berwick, Maine, began his musical journey playing keyboards in high school garage bands, including The Magic Rats with childhood friend Rod Picott in 1980, and later singing covers with The Classifieds behind a Hammond Porta-B organ in local venues.[1][2][4] After studying abroad in Cork, Ireland, during college where he learned guitar and debuted as a busker, he released early cassettes like *The Promise* (1990) and fronted the alt-country band The Moxie Men with *Looks Good from the Road* (1991) in Portland, Maine.[4][1] In late 1991, Cleaves moved to Austin, Texas, with his wife Karen, immersing himself in the vibrant scene amid artists like Lucinda Williams and Joe Ely, winning the Kerrville Folk Festival New Folk award in 1992, and persisting through open mics and side jobs.[1][3][4][5]

Cleaves's career breakthrough came in 1997 with *No Angel Knows*, produced by Gurf Morlix for Rounder-Philo, blending folk, early rock and roll, traditional country, and Americana influences from Woody Guthrie, Johnny Cash, Hank Williams, Bruce Springsteen, and others.[1][2][4] Key albums followed, including the chart-topping *Broke Down* (2000, co-written with Picott), *Wishbones* (2004, #1 on Americana charts), *Unsung* (2006, covers of friends' songs), *Everything You Love Will Be Taken Away* (2009), and *Still Fighting the War* (2013), with recent work like *Together Through the Dark* (2022) produced by Scrappy Jud Newcomb.[1][2][4][5] He toured extensively across North America, the UK, and Netherlands, performing at festivals like Newport, Cambridge, and Kerrville.[1]

Cleaves's style—storytelling with a novelist's eye and poet's heart—has earned critical acclaim, fan loyalty including Stephen King, and a lasting legacy in Americana, alt-country, red dirt, Texas country, and outlaw country, with 25+ years of heartfelt, chart-successful records.[1][2][4][6]
