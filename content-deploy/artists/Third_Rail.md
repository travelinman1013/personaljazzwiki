## Biography
Third Rail is a name shared by several musical acts, but the most prominent is The Third Rail, an American pop/rock group active in the 1960s. Formed by studio musicians Arthur Resnick, his wife Kris Resnick, and Joey Levine, the group emerged from New York's vibrant Brill Building songwriting scene. Arthur Resnick was already an established songwriter, having penned classics like 'Under the Boardwalk' for The Drifters and 'Good Lovin'' for The Rascals, while Levine was a teenage musician gaining experience in local bands. The trio's collaboration resulted in a blend of catchy pop melodies and sophisticated songwriting, culminating in their 1967 single 'Run Run Run,' which reached No. 53 on the Billboard Hot 100, and the release of their only album, 'Id Music,' on Epic Records.

Despite their studio prowess, The Third Rail performed live only once, in Cincinnati, focusing instead on recording and songwriting. After releasing a handful of singles, the group disbanded in 1968. Joey Levine went on to achieve further fame as the voice behind the Ohio Express hit 'Yummy Yummy Yummy,' while all three members continued to write songs for the Kasenetz & Katz production team, contributing to the bubblegum pop movement of the late 1960s. The Third Rail's legacy lies in their seamless fusion of pop sensibility and studio craftsmanship, as well as their influence on the sound of late-60s American pop.
