## Biography
Archie Shepp, born May 24, 1937, in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and raised in Philadelphia, is a pioneering American tenor saxophonist, composer, dramatist, and educator, best known for his influential role in the free jazz and avant-garde movements. After studying drama at Goddard College, Shepp turned to music, initially playing piano and clarinet before settling on the tenor saxophone. He began his professional career in New York City, notably joining Cecil Taylor’s groundbreaking quartet from 1960 to 1962, and soon after formed the New York Contemporary Five, collaborating with figures like Don Cherry and John Tchicai. 

Throughout the 1960s, Shepp developed a distinctive style characterized by a gruff tone, wide vibrato, and expressive techniques such as multiphonics and harsh screams, drawing inspiration from saxophonists John Coltrane and Ben Webster. His work often incorporated Afrocentric themes and political consciousness, as heard in albums like 'Fire Music' (1965) and 'Attica Blues' (1972). Shepp’s music blended free-form improvisation with African rhythms, blues, and spoken word, making him a leading voice in jazz’s engagement with social issues. 

Beyond performance, Shepp had a significant academic career, teaching African American studies and ethnomusicology at SUNY Buffalo and later at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, where he remained until 2002. His legacy endures through his innovative recordings, collaborations with jazz greats, and his influence on subsequent generations of musicians, as well as his recognition as a Jazz Master by the National Endowment for the Arts in 2016.
