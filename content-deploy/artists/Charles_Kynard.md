## Biography
Charles Elliot Kynard (February 20, 1933 – July 8, 1979) was a highly respected American jazz organist, celebrated for his soulful, groove-driven style that bridged jazz, funk, and gospel traditions. Born in Kansas City, Missouri, to a family of professional musicians, Kynard began his musical journey on piano at age nine before switching to the organ. He pursued extensive formal education, earning undergraduate and graduate degrees from the University of Kansas and completing postgraduate studies at institutions including UCLA and the Hock-Schule for Music in Berlin. Early in his career, Kynard led his own jazz trio in Kansas City and gained national exposure through performances with the U.S. Army show and appearances on the Ed Sullivan Show.

In 1963, Kynard relocated to Los Angeles, where he became active in Hollywood studio orchestras and began recording with Pacific Jazz Records. He soon established himself as a leading figure in the soul-jazz and acid jazz scenes, particularly through his work with Prestige Records from 1968 to 1971. Albums such as 'Afro-Disiac' and 'Wa-Tu-Wa-Zui' showcased his dynamic left-hand technique, blues-based improvisation, and ability to create infectious grooves. Kynard collaborated with notable musicians like Grant Green, Houston Person, and Bernard "Pretty" Purdie, and was recognized for his contributions to both the jazz and gospel communities, serving as a church organist and music educator throughout his life.

Though he never achieved the mainstream fame of some contemporaries, Kynard's recordings remain influential within jazz funk and soul jazz circles. His legacy endures through his innovative approach to the Hammond organ, his mentorship of younger musicians, and his dedication to music education and community service.
