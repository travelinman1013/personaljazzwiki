## Biography
Bill Summers was born on June 27, 1948, in Detroit, Michigan, where his mother introduced him to music at an early age.[1][2] He studied piano, composition, and theory at the Detroit Conservatory of Music starting in 1953 for ten years, and later attended the Michigan Conservatory of Music from 1970 to 1974 for classical training.[2] He also pursued ethnomusicology at the University of California, Berkeley.[2] Summers emerged as a prominent Afro-Cuban jazz and Latin jazz percussionist, specializing primarily on conga drums while developing mastery across multiple percussion instruments and even unconventional sound sources like pop bottles.[4]

Summers' professional career gained significant momentum in the 1970s when Herbie Hancock hired him for the legendary fusion group the Headhunters, where he played alongside drummer Mike Clark.[3][6] He remained with the Headhunters during their most innovative period, contributing to their groundbreaking work that fused jazz with funk and rock.[3] Beyond his work with the Headhunters, Summers founded Bill Summers & Summers Heat in the 1970s, which produced seven albums between 1977 and 1983, achieving commercial success with singles like "Call It What You Want" (1981), which reached No. 16 on the U.S. Black Singles chart.[1] He also worked extensively behind the scenes on film and television scores, including Quincy Jones' acclaimed miniseries Roots and the film The Color Purple.[1][2]

In the 1990s, Summers relocated to New Orleans and became a cultural institution in the city's music scene.[4] He co-founded Los Hombres Calientes in 1998 with trumpeter Irvin Mayfield and Jason Marsalis, creating an overnight sensation that blended Latin rhythms with jazz fusion.[4] Throughout his career, Summers has been recognized as a Grammy Award nominee and Billboard Music Award winner.[3] Beyond performance, he established the Summers Multi-Ethnic Institute of Art with his musician wife Yvette Bostic-Summers, taking students to Cuba to study Afro-Cuban music and earning initiation into the prestigious Yoruba order of sacred drummers in 1999.[4] His late-night musical sessions at his New Orleans home became legendary incubators for creative collaboration and artistic development.[4]
