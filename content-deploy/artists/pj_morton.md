## Biography
PJ Morton, born Paul Sylvester Morton Jr. on March 29, 1981, in New Orleans, Louisiana, is a Grammy-winning musician, singer, songwriter, and producer celebrated for his distinctive blend of neo soul, R&B, gospel, and funk. Raised in a deeply musical household—his father is a renowned pastor and gospel singer—Morton learned to play instruments by ear from a young age, starting with drums before gravitating to the piano, which became his primary instrument. The vibrant musical culture of New Orleans, with its gospel roots and second line parades, profoundly shaped his artistic sensibilities.

Morton's career began to flourish with the release of his debut solo EP, 'Following My First Mind,' in 2012, followed by his major-label debut album 'New Orleans' in 2013. He gained widespread recognition as the keyboardist for Maroon 5, initially joining as a touring member in 2010 and becoming an official member in 2012. His solo work, particularly the critically acclaimed albums 'Gumbo' (2017) and 'Watch The Sun' (2022), has earned him multiple Grammy Awards and nominations, cementing his reputation as a leading voice in contemporary soul and R&B. Morton is also known for his collaborations with artists across genres and his efforts to preserve New Orleans' musical heritage, such as his project to restore jazz pioneer Buddy Bolden's home.

Morton's music is characterized by its soulful authenticity, genre-blurring arrangements, and deeply personal lyricism. He draws inspiration from the spiritual and communal aspects of soul music, often weaving themes of hope, resilience, and love into his work. As both a solo artist and a member of Maroon 5, Morton has left a lasting legacy, influencing a new generation of musicians while honoring the traditions of his hometown.
