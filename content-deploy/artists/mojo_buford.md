## Biography
George 'Mojo' Buford (November 10, 1929 – October 11, 2011) was an influential American blues harmonica player, best known for his long association with Muddy Waters. Born in Hernando, Mississippi, Buford moved to Memphis as a youth, where he was inspired by blues legends such as B.B. King and Little Walter. He began playing harmonica at age twelve and, after a brief stay in Cleveland, relocated to Chicago in the early 1950s. There, he formed The Savage Boys, which soon gained the attention of Muddy Waters and became known as the Muddy Waters Jr. Band, substituting for Waters at local clubs when he was on tour.

Buford's big break came in 1959 when he joined Muddy Waters's band, initially replacing Little Walter. He played with Waters for several years, establishing himself as a dynamic harmonica player with a robust, expressive style rooted in the Chicago blues tradition. In 1962, Buford moved to Minneapolis, where he fronted his own band and recorded several albums, earning the nickname 'Mojo' from fans who frequently requested his version of 'Got My Mojo Working.' Throughout his career, Buford had multiple stints with Muddy Waters, touring internationally and recording extensively. He also collaborated with many Twin Cities musicians and continued to perform and record into the 1990s, helping to spread the blues to new audiences in the U.S. and Europe.

Buford's legacy lies in his powerful harmonica technique, his role in keeping the Chicago blues sound alive, and his mentorship of younger musicians. He was inducted into the Minnesota Rock Country Hall in 2004 and is remembered as a vital link between the Mississippi Delta and the urban blues scenes of Chicago and Minneapolis.
