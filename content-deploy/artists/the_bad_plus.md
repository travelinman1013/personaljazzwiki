## Biography
The Bad Plus is an American jazz group known for its genre-defying approach and innovative reinterpretations of popular music. Originally formed in the late 1990s in Minnesota by pianist Ethan Iverson, bassist Reid Anderson, and drummer Dave King, the band officially debuted in 2000 and quickly gained acclaim for their energetic blend of jazz, rock, and avant-garde influences. Their early years were marked by a unique piano trio format, which brought a rock sensibility and a sense of humor to the jazz world, as well as a willingness to cover songs from artists as diverse as Nirvana, ABBA, and Aphex Twin, alongside their own original compositions.[3][5][8]

Over the years, The Bad Plus became known for their democratic ethos and refusal to conform to jazz conventions, earning a reputation as one of the most adventurous and unpredictable bands in modern jazz. After Iverson’s departure in 2017, the group welcomed pianist Orrin Evans, recording two albums before reinventing themselves again in 2021 as a quartet with guitarist Ben Monder and saxophonist Chris Speed, abandoning the piano entirely. This new lineup marked a bold new chapter, expanding their sonic palette while maintaining the band’s core spirit of innovation and collective improvisation.[1][4][6][7]

The Bad Plus has left a lasting legacy on contemporary jazz, redefining the possibilities of the piano trio and, later, the jazz quartet. Their fearless integration of rock, pop, and experimental elements has inspired a new generation of musicians to challenge genre boundaries and embrace creative risk-taking.
