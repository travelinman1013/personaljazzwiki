## Biography
Roger Wolfe Kahn (October 19, 1907 – July 12, 1962) was an American jazz and popular music bandleader, composer, and multi-instrumentalist, renowned for leading 'Roger Wolfe Kahn and His Orchestra' during the 1920s and early 1930s. Born into immense wealth as the son of financier Otto Kahn in New York City, Roger was exposed to the arts from an early age and began studying violin at six. By his teens, he had taught himself to play eighteen instruments and demonstrated a precocious talent for both performance and leadership. At just sixteen, Kahn purchased the Arthur Lange Orchestra, using his family's resources to assemble a group of top-tier musicians, and debuted his own band at the Bohemian Cabaret in 1924. 

Kahn's orchestra quickly became a fixture in New York's vibrant jazz scene, performing at prestigious venues such as the Biltmore Hotel and recording for major labels including Victor, Brunswick, and Columbia. His musical style blended the sophisticated arrangements of dance orchestras with the rhythmic vitality of jazz, and he was known for hiring and collaborating with some of the era's best musicians. Kahn also composed for Broadway, co-writing the jazz standard 'Crazy Rhythm' and contributing to several revues. Despite his early success, Kahn's career as a bandleader waned by the 1930s, after which he shifted focus to aviation, another of his passions. 

Though not as widely remembered as some contemporaries, Kahn's legacy endures through his recordings and compositions, as well as his influence on the professionalization of jazz orchestras. His innovative approach to band management, generous treatment of musicians, and early embrace of jazz as a serious art form contributed to the genre's development during its formative years.
