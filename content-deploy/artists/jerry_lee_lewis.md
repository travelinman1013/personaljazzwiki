## Biography
Jerry Lee Lewis (September 29, 1935 – October 28, 2022) was an American pianist, singer, and songwriter born in Ferriday, Louisiana, to Elmo Kidd Lewis Sr. and Mary “Mamie” Herron Lewis.[1][5] Raised in a poor but deeply religious family, he began playing piano as a child, often with his cousins Mickey Gilley and Jimmy Swaggart, and his parents mortgaged their farm to buy him his own instrument.[1][4] He absorbed gospel, country, and blues heard in church, on the radio, and outside Haney’s Big House, a local Black juke joint, blending these styles into a fiery boogie‑woogie‑based approach that rejected the divide between sacred and secular music.[1][2][5]

After early attempts to break into the music business in New Orleans, Shreveport, and Nashville, Lewis moved to Memphis and auditioned for Sun Records, initially working as a studio musician before cutting his own records.[2][3][4] In 1956–57 he burst onto the national scene with “Whole Lotta Shakin’ Goin’ On” and “Great Balls of Fire,” showcasing a wild, percussive piano style and uninhibited stage presence that helped define early rock and roll.[1][3] His career nearly collapsed in 1958 after public scandal over his marriage to his 13‑year‑old cousin Myra Gale Brown, but he rebuilt his reputation over the 1960s and 1970s, especially as a country artist with numerous hits on the country charts and a reputation as one of popular music’s most intense live performers.[1][3][9]

Lewis’s musical style fused pounding left‑hand boogie‑woogie bass figures, glissandos, and gospel shouts with country storytelling and R&B swing, delivered with showman’s bravado—kicking back the piano bench, playing with his feet, and exuding rebellious charisma.[1][3] Nicknamed “The Killer,” he became a founding figure of rock and roll and rockabilly, later recognized by induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame’s inaugural class in 1986 and the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2022.[1][3][9] His influence can be heard in generations of rock, country, and piano‑driven performers, securing his legacy as one of the music’s original and most volatile architects.[1][2][3]

## Fun Facts
- Lewis was expelled from a Bible college in Waxahachie, Texas, after playing a boogie‑woogie version of the hymn “My God Is Real” at a church event, which school authorities deemed too worldly.[1][4][7]
- His parents were so convinced of his talent that they mortgaged their farm to buy him a piano when he was a child, despite the family’s poverty.[1][2][4]
- In 1956 he took part—largely by accident—in the legendary Sun Studio jam session later known as the “Million Dollar Quartet,” alongside Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, and Carl Perkins.[1][3]
- Lewis was nicknamed “The Killer,” a moniker that came to symbolize both his ferocious performance style and his reputation as one of rock and roll’s most intense personalities.[1]
