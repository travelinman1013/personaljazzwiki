## Biography
Hank Jones, born Henry Jones Jr. on July 31, 1918, in Vicksburg, Mississippi, was a towering figure in jazz piano whose career spanned more than seven decades. Raised in Pontiac, Michigan, in a musically gifted family that included his brothers Thad and Elvin Jones, Hank began performing professionally as a teenager. Influenced early on by pianists such as Earl Hines, Fats Waller, and especially Art Tatum, Jones quickly developed a reputation for his refined touch and versatility, blending classical, gospel, and jazz idioms with effortless grace.

After moving to New York City in 1944, Jones became a sought-after accompanist and session musician, performing with jazz luminaries including Ella Fitzgerald, Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, and Coleman Hawkins. He was a key participant in the bebop movement and later formed the acclaimed Great Jazz Trio in the 1970s. Jones’s elegant, lyrical style and inventive left-hand voicings made him a favorite among both peers and critics, and he appeared on thousands of recordings, both as a leader and sideman. His contributions were recognized with honors such as the NEA Jazz Masters Award and the National Medal of Arts.

Throughout his life, Jones remained a consummate professional, known for his humility and adaptability. His legacy endures not only in his extensive discography but also in the generations of pianists he influenced through his subtle artistry and unwavering musical integrity.
