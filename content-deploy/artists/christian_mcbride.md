## Biography
Christian McBride, born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, grew up immersed in music through his family: his father, bassist Lee Smith, who played with Mongo Santamaria; his great-uncle, bassist Howard Cooper; his mother, an audiophile and educator; and his uncle, a radio promotions figure. This Philly Soul and jazz foundation shaped his early development, leading him to master electric bass as a youth before pursuing classical upright bass studies at the Juilliard School in New York City in 1989 at age 17.[1][2][3][8] Quickly recruited by alto saxophonist Bobby Watson, McBride launched a prolific career as a sideman with jazz legends including Freddie Hubbard, Sonny Rollins, J.J. Johnson, Joe Henderson, McCoy Tyner, Herbie Hancock, Pat Metheny, Chick Corea, Wynton Marsalis, and Ray Brown.[1][2][4][7]

McBride's career evolved into leadership with groups like the Christian McBride Band (formed 2000, featuring Ron Blake, Geoffrey Keezer, Terreon Gully), Inside Straight quintet (2009), Christian McBride Big Band (GRAMMY for *The Good Feeling*, 2012), Trio with Christian Sands and Ulysses Owens Jr., Ursa Major, New Jawn, and A Christian McBride Situation. A composer and arranger since 1995 (e.g., *Bluesin’ in Alphabet City* for Jazz at Lincoln Center), he has crossed genres with The Roots, Sting, James Brown, and others, earning nine GRAMMYs as a six-to-nine-time winner.[3][4][5][7] His style blends swing, virtuosity, Philly Soul roots, and forward-thinking fusion, emphasizing rising stars.[3][4]

As an educator, curator, and administrator, McBride serves as Artistic Director of the Newport Jazz Festival, NJPAC, TD James Moody Jazz Festival, National Jazz Museum in Harlem, Jazz House Kids (co-founded by wife Melissa Walker), and Jazz Aspen Snowmass. His legacy bridges generations, mentoring youth while maintaining a dynamic presence in jazz.[3][5][6][7]
