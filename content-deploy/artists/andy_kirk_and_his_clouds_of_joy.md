## Biography
Andy Kirk (Andrew Dewey Kirk, 1898–1992) was an influential American jazz bandleader and saxophonist best known for leading the Twelve Clouds of Joy, a prominent big band during the swing era. Born in Newport, Kentucky, Kirk grew up in Denver, Colorado, where he received musical instruction from Wilberforce Whiteman, the father of famed bandleader Paul Whiteman. Kirk began his professional career in 1919 with George Morrison's band, playing alto saxophone and tuba, and later joined Terrence Holder's Dark Clouds of Joy in Dallas.

In 1929, Kirk was elected leader of the band after Holder's departure, renaming it the Clouds of Joy and relocating the group to Kansas City, Missouri. The band quickly became a fixture at venues like the Pla-Mor Ballroom and gained national attention after recording for Brunswick Records. Under Kirk's direction, the Clouds of Joy epitomized the Kansas City jazz sound, blending sophisticated arrangements with energetic swing. The group featured several future jazz luminaries, most notably pianist and arranger Mary Lou Williams, whose innovative style helped define the band's musical identity. Kirk's band enjoyed significant success throughout the 1930s and 1940s, producing hits such as "I Won't Tell a Soul (I Love You)" and "Take It and Git," which topped the Harlem Hit Parade in 1942.

Kirk was not a flamboyant showman but excelled at organizing and arranging, making his band one of the leading purveyors of the Kansas City swing style alongside Count Basie and Bennie Moten. After dissolving the band in 1948, Kirk pursued careers in real estate and served as an administrator for musicians' unions in New York. His legacy endures through his contributions to big band jazz and the careers he helped launch.
