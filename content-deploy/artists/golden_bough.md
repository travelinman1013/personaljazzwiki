## Biography
Golden Bough is a Celtic music band formed in January 1980 by Margie Butler and Paul Espinoza, who initially performed together as a duo before expanding their vision into a full ensemble. The band's founding concept was to blend traditional Celtic music from Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Cornwall, the Isle of Man, French Brittany, and Spanish Galicia with contemporary acoustic arrangements and original compositions. They were joined early on by folk artist Lief Sørbye, and their first recording in 1981 featured a five-piece lineup including violinist Margot Duxler and multi-instrumentalist Simon Spaulding. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Golden Bough established themselves as a significant force in the folk music scene, touring extensively across the United States and Europe while recording multiple albums that showcased their distinctive approach to traditional material.

Over their 45-year career, Golden Bough has released over 30 recordings and become known for their pristine vocal harmonies and mastery of diverse acoustic instruments including Celtic harp, penny whistle, violin, octave-mandolin, accordion, guitar, bodhran, and recorder. The band's lineup has evolved over the decades, with notable members including Florie Brown (violin), Richard Ferry (flute), Alison Bailey (fiddle), Sue Draheim (violin), and Kathy Sierra (violin and vocals), who joined in 2001 and brought renewed energy to the group. Their musical repertoire spans traditional ballads, lively jigs and reels, and sing-alongs, drawing from sources such as Eric Bogle, Archie Fisher, and Brendan Graham, while also featuring Paul Espinoza's original compositions. Golden Bough has gained critical acclaim and enthusiastic support from folk music enthusiasts on both sides of the Atlantic, becoming a popular and in-demand group for performances at music festivals, concert halls, and educational events.

Beyond their musical performances, Golden Bough has been actively involved in social and humanitarian causes, including peace marches protesting the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina and musical presentations for elementary school children. The band's commitment to capturing the essence and joy of traditional folk music while maintaining their unique artistic identity has solidified their legacy as one of the most respected Celtic music ensembles of their generation.

## Fun Facts
- The band's formation was inspired by a series of concerts at the Cannery at Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco, where founders Margie Butler and Paul Espinoza attended performances before deciding to create their own ensemble.
- Golden Bough has released over 30 recordings across 45 years, demonstrating remarkable longevity and productivity in the folk music genre, with albums ranging from traditional Celtic music to children's songs and Christmas recordings.
- The band has been involved in significant social activism, including organizing and participating in peace marches across European cities protesting the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, demonstrating their commitment to using music as a vehicle for social change.
- Paul Espinoza's composition 'Black Jack Davy' reimagines the traditional folk song by shifting perspective—instead of a man pursuing his unfaithful wife, Espinoza's version presents Black Jack Davy as a ghostly lover unable to abandon his search after three years of separation.
