## Biography
Olívia Hime (born June 25, 1943 in Rio de Janeiro) is a Brazilian singer, songwriter, lyricist, producer, and label executive closely associated with the post-bossa nova wave of Música Popular Brasileira (MPB).[2][5][6] Early in her career she sang in a vocal group with Miúcha and Telma Costa, placing her within the same Rio artistic circles that nurtured many major MPB figures.[5] She later married pianist and composer Francis Hime, becoming not only a key interpreter of his songs but also an important creative partner, producer, and promoter of Brazilian music through performance and record production.[4][6] In 1977 she co-produced Francis Hime’s album "Passaredo," helping shape its sound and demonstrating her studio acumen before releasing her own debut LP, "Olívia Hime," in 1981.[1][4][6]

From the mid‑1980s onward, Hime deepened her ties to Brazilian literature and poetry, building a distinctive repertoire that often set verse by celebrated poets to music.[1][6] Critics note that her work favors refined arrangements, clear diction, and an intimate vocal delivery aligned with the MPB tradition rather than pop trends.[6] Beyond her work as a performer, she became co‑owner and musical director of the influential independent label **Biscoito Fino**, through which she has helped document and disseminate both classic and contemporary Brazilian artists, including multiple albums by Francis Hime and other MPB heavyweights.[2][4] This dual role as artist and curator has given her a quiet but lasting legacy: she is regarded as a guardian of Brazilian songcraft and a bridge between generations of Rio’s musical and literary communities.[2][4][6]
