## Biography
David Porter, born November 21, 1941 in Memphis, Tennessee, is a seminal figure in American soul music, renowned as a songwriter, producer, singer, and entrepreneur. Growing up on Virginia Avenue, Porter formed a gospel group at age six with Maurice White, who would later found Earth, Wind & Fire. By age 11, Porter was leading his own band and writing songs, and as a teenager, he performed in Memphis clubs under the name 'Little David.' After a brief stint at LeMoyne College, he began working at Stax Records, initially as a background vocalist and later as a songwriter and producer[2][3][5].

Porter's partnership with Isaac Hayes at Stax Records became legendary, producing classics such as "Hold On, I'm Coming," "Soul Man," and "I Thank You" for Sam & Dave, among many others. Their songwriting prowess helped define the Memphis soul sound of the 1960s and 1970s, and Porter’s catalog now exceeds 1,700 songwriting and composer credits for artists ranging from Aretha Franklin and Otis Redding to Drake and Wu-Tang Clan[1][4]. His work has been widely sampled and covered, influencing generations of musicians across genres. Porter was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2005 and named one of Rolling Stone’s 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time in 2015[4].

Beyond his creative output, Porter has been a key figure in nurturing Memphis’s musical legacy, founding the Consortium MMT to develop local talent and serving as Vice President of A&R/Talent at Stax. His influence extends through his mentorship, philanthropy, and tireless advocacy for the music industry in Memphis, cementing his legacy as one of soul music’s most important architects[4][2].
