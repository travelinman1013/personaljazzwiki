## Biography
Solomon Hicks, often billed as **King Solomon Hicks**, is an American blues guitarist, vocalist, songwriter, and composer from Harlem, New York. Born and raised in Harlem, he was surrounded by music at home and in local clubs; his parents constantly played records, and his mother took him as a child to legendary uptown venues like Lennox Lounge, Saint Nick’s and the Cotton Club, experiences that shaped his ambitions and ear for jazz and blues.[2][3][4][7] He began playing guitar at about six years old and quickly developed a reputation as “the kid in school that had a guitar on his back,” practicing relentlessly and soaking up knowledge from older musicians at open jams and late‑night sessions.[2][3][4][7]

By his early teens, Hicks had already stepped onto one of New York’s most storied stages: at 13 he became the lead guitarist in a large band at the Cotton Club in Harlem, performing there multiple nights a week and eventually recording his first album, *Embryonic*, with the Cotton Club All‑Star Band at just 14.[1][2] An eclectic player fluent in jazz, blues, gospel, R&B, funk, classic rock and even some classical guitar, he built his craft as both a rhythm and lead guitarist before his own soloing voice came to the fore.[1][2] After high school, he began touring more widely, playing clubs such as the Iridium and Terra Blues in New York and then extending to Europe and Japan, where he opened for artists like Jeff Beck and Ringo Starr, and appeared on cruises including KISS Kruise V and Joe Bonamassa’s Blues Alive at Sea.[2][3][4]

Hicks’ breakthrough on record came with *Harlem*, his first major‑label album, released on Provogue Records in 2020 and produced by Grammy‑winner Kirk Yano.[3][4] On *Harlem* he presents a modern take on the blues—rooted in traditional forms but filtered through soul, rock, and jazz—with a sound he has described as what the blues should feel like “in 2019,” maintaining “a foot in the blues” while avoiding strict traditionalism.[3][5] The album helped establish him as a leading young voice in contemporary blues, earning him the 2021 Blues Music Award for Best Emerging Artist and spotlight recognition such as WXPN’s “Artist To Watch.”[4] Alongside his performance career, Hicks has become an ambassador for the music that raised him, judging at the International Blues Challenge in Memphis, teaching for organizations like the Children’s Aid Society, and supporting programs through groups such as the Harlem Arts Alliance and New York City Jazzmobile, thereby extending his legacy to the next generation of blues and jazz musicians.[2][4]
