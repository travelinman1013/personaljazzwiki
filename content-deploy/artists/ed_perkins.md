## Biography
Publicly available information identifies more than one musician named Ed Perkins, and current sources do not provide enough detail to reliably match any of them to the low-profile Spotify artist you referenced. Because of this ambiguity, it is not possible to write a single, accurate, and comprehensive biography for “Ed Perkins” the recording artist without risking conflating the lives and careers of different individuals.

One Ed Perkins appears in the British Music Collection as a UK-based composer with a BSc in Music from City University London and a master’s degree in composition from Goldsmiths, who is active as a teacher and contemporary composer, but that profile does not clearly connect to a commercial recording identity on Spotify.[4] Another Ed Perkins profile on BandMix describes a 71‑year‑old rock musician in Maitland, Florida, active as a keyboardist and rhythm guitarist in classic rock, pop, and cover/tribute contexts, again with no verifiable link to the Spotify artist in question.[3] A New Orleans jazz vocalist named Ed Perkins also appears in an interview/performance context on YouTube, performing standards and discussing an extensive live career, but no discography or formal biography is provided that would allow confident identification as the same Spotify artist.[1] In the absence of clear, corroborated connections between these individuals and the Spotify profile, any synthesized “biography” would be speculative and therefore not reliable.

## Fun Facts
- Multiple active musicians named Ed Perkins appear in public sources, including a British contemporary composer, a Florida-based classic rock keyboardist/guitarist, and a New Orleans jazz vocalist, but none can be definitively linked to the specific Spotify artist profile you provided.[1][3][4]
- The UK-based composer Ed Perkins holds a BSc in Music from City University London and a Master’s degree in composition from Goldsmiths, University of London, and is active in teaching and composing contemporary music, though no mainstream streaming discography is clearly attached to this profile.[4]
- The BandMix profile for Ed Perkins in Maitland, Florida, lists him as a 71‑year‑old multi‑instrumentalist (keyboards and rhythm guitar) focused on classic rock, pop, and tribute/cover work, suggesting a long local or regional performance history rather than a widely documented recording career.[3]
