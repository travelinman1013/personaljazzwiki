## Biography
Choupique is a Louisiana-based Cajun band that has been active for over 19 years, known for their authentic performances of classic Cajun and zydeco music[3][2][4]. The group draws its name from a local fish, reflecting their deep roots in Louisiana culture and the bayou country[4]. Their music is characterized by a blend of heartfelt traditional Cajun tunes and energetic, danceable zydeco rhythms, appealing to both local audiences and fans of roots music. The band has recorded three CDs and multiple singles, performing regularly at local dances, festivals, weddings, and fais do dos[3].

The band was formed by Jesse Brown, who grew up on a rice farm outside Eunice, Louisiana, immersed in the sounds of Cajun and zydeco music from an early age[1]. Jesse's grandfather, Eddie Brown, was a significant musical influence, playing accordion for the family and passing down the tradition. After working in Alaska and returning home, Jesse apprenticed with Larry Miller of Bon Cajun Accordions, learning the craft of building and tuning Cajun accordions by hand[1][5]. This dedication to craftsmanship and tradition is reflected in both the band's sound and Jesse's business, Choupique Accordions LLC, which produces custom 10-button Cajun accordions[5].

Choupique's legacy lies in their commitment to preserving and revitalizing Cajun musical traditions, blending classic influences with their own eclectic style. Their performances and recordings have contributed to the ongoing popularity of Cajun and zydeco music in Louisiana and beyond, making them a respected name in the regional music scene[3][4].
