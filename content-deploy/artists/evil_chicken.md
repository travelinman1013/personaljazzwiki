## Biography
Evil Chicken is a contemporary stoner and space rock project that blends heavy southern rock riffs, fuzz-drenched guitar tones, and psychedelic atmospheres into what the artist describes as “southern rock, stoner fuzz, psychedelic doom swamp goo” and “music for lizards in leather jackets and gas station mystics.”[1] Centered around this tongue‑in‑cheek, outsider persona, Evil Chicken has cultivated a niche presence online, particularly via YouTube and streaming platforms, where the project’s hazy, riff‑forward sound aligns with classic stoner rock and stoner metal aesthetics.[1][3] The track “Born to Be High,” promoted through an official lyric video and short‑form clips, exemplifies this approach with its slow‑rolling groove, thick distortion, and celebration of altered‑state rock culture.[2][4]

While detailed biographical information about the individual(s) behind Evil Chicken has not been publicly documented in reliable sources, the project’s branding suggests roots in southern‑influenced rock traditions, filtered through contemporary DIY internet culture.[1] Through self‑released material and social media activity, Evil Chicken has positioned itself within the broader stoner and space rock underground rather than the mainstream, focusing on atmosphere, vibe, and humor more than conventional industry narratives.[1][3] As of now, its legacy is primarily tied to its distinctive aesthetic and its contribution to the ongoing, grassroots revival of fuzz‑heavy, psychedelic‑leaning heavy rock on digital platforms.

Given the lack of verifiable interviews, label bios, or press profiles, further specifics about early life, formal career stages, and long‑term impact cannot be accurately confirmed from currently available sources.

## Fun Facts
- On the official YouTube ‘About’ section, Evil Chicken describes its sound with the highly specific tagline “Southern rock, stoner fuzz, psychedelic doom swamp goo,” framing the project as both heavy and humorously self‑aware.[1]
- The same YouTube bio includes a surreal boast – “I once smoked a joint so strong I laid an album” – reinforcing the project’s alignment with classic stoner‑rock culture and tongue‑in‑cheek myth‑making.[1]
- Evil Chicken actively directs listeners from YouTube Shorts and videos like the “Born to Be High” lyric video to follow the project on Spotify and other streaming services, indicating a primarily digital distribution and promotion strategy.[2][3][4]
