## Biography
Kevin Russell, known professionally as Shinyribs, was born in Beaumont, Texas, and raised in a Church of Christ family before discovering his musical passion as a teenager in Shreveport, Louisiana, and biker bars where he played loud country blues rock and psychedelic swamp jangle starting at age 17[2][4]. He formed the regionally popular band Picket Line Coyotes, which toured the college circuit until the early 1990s, then moved to Austin via Dallas in 1988-1991, evolving into The Gourds in 1994 with key members like Jimmy Smith, Claude Bernard, and Charlie Llewellin, becoming staples in the Americana and genre-bending scenes[1][2][4]. Shinyribs began in 2007 as Russell's solo side project to showcase his prolific songwriting beyond The Gourds' sets, initially as monthly gigs in Houston, named after a transient woman's shout following a plate of ribs he gave her[1][4][5].

After The Gourds hiatus in 2013, Shinyribs became Russell's primary outlet, expanding into a nine- or ten-piece Austin-based band featuring drums from his brother-in-law Keith Langford, bass, keyboards, horns (Tijuana TrainWreck Horns), pedal steel, and backing vocals from Shiny Soul Sisters, with a sound blending country-soul, swamp-funk, Texas Blues, New Orleans R&B, Memphis Soul, country twang, border music, big band swing, and roots-rock[1][3][5]. Live shows highlight Russell's charismatic stage presence, dancing, conga lines through crowds, colorful suits, extravagant shoes, light-up cloaks, and instrument swaps between guitar, ukulele, and mandolin[1][5][7]. The band released their debut *Well After Awhile* in 2010, produced by Russell and George Reiff, and earned 'Best Austin Band' at the Austin Chronicle Music Awards in 2017 and 2018[2][5].

Shinyribs represents Russell's vision for a genre-defying supergroup, transitioning from solo acoustic origins to a full horn-driven ensemble that captivates with cinematic energy and his longstanding roots in Texas music scenes[1][4][5].
