## Biography
Kenny Dorham, born McKinley Howard Dorham on August 30, 1924, in Fairfield, Texas, emerged as one of the most influential trumpeters in the development of bebop and hard bop jazz. Raised in a musically inclined family, Dorham first learned piano before switching to saxophone and then trumpet during high school in Austin. He attended Wiley College, studying chemistry and physics, but his passion for music led him to pursue a career as a professional musician after serving in the U.S. Army during World War II[2][5].

Dorham's career accelerated in the mid-1940s when he played with the big bands of Dizzy Gillespie, Billy Eckstine, Lionel Hampton, and Mercer Ellington. In 1948, he replaced Miles Davis in Charlie Parker's quintet, helping to define the emerging bebop style characterized by fast tempos, complex arrangements, and inventive solos[1][2][3][4]. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, Dorham became a fixture of the New York jazz scene, collaborating with Thelonious Monk, Charles Mingus, Art Blakey, and Max Roach, among others. He co-founded the original Jazz Messengers and later led his own groups, including the Jazz Prophets and combos featuring future stars like Joe Henderson and Cannonball Adderley[2][3][4].

Dorham's musical style was marked by a warm, lyrical tone and long, flowing melodic lines. He was a prolific composer, with works such as "Blue Bossa," "Lotus Blossom," and "Una Mas" becoming jazz standards[4]. Despite being overshadowed by contemporaries like Dizzy Gillespie and Miles Davis, Dorham's artistry and versatility made him a transitional figure between bebop and hard bop. His legacy endures through his influential recordings for Blue Note and Prestige, including "Quiet Kenny," "Whistle Stop," and "Una Mas." Dorham continued performing and composing until declining health curtailed his career; he died of kidney disease in New York City on December 5, 1972, at age 48[1][3].
