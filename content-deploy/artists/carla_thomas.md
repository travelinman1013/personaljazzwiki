## Biography
Carla Venita Thomas, born December 21, 1942, in Memphis, Tennessee, grew up immersed in music as the daughter of entertainer Rufus Thomas. Her professional career launched at age 17 while attending Hamilton High School, with the 1960 duet 'Cause I Love You' alongside her father, recorded for Satellite Records (later Stax) with brother Marvell on keyboards. This success attracted Atlantic Records, leading to her solo hit 'Gee Whiz (Look at His Eyes),' which she wrote at 16 and which peaked at No. 5 on the R&B charts and No. 10 on pop, propelling Stax to prominence.[1][2][3][5]

Thomas became the undisputed Queen of Memphis Soul through her 1960s Stax recordings, including 'B-A-B-Y' (1966) and the duet 'Tramp' (1967) with Otis Redding from their album *King & Queen*, which also featured 'Knock on Wood' and 'Lovey Dovey.' She was the only Stax female artist to release full-length albums, charting over 20 times, touring Europe with the Stax/Volt Revue, and performing at the 1972 Wattstax concert. Her style blended plaintive soul vocals with Memphis' gritty Southern sound. She stayed with Stax until 1975, later releasing *Love Means...* in 1971.[1][2][4][5]

Post-Stax, Thomas contributed to community programs like 'Artists in the Schools' in the 1980s, earned the 1993 Rhythm & Blues Foundation Pioneer Award alongside James Brown and Solomon Burke, appeared in the 2003 documentary *Only the Strong Survive*, and featured on Valerie June's 2021 GRAMMY-nominated 'Call Me a Fool.' She received 1967 GRAMMY nominations and a 2021 Americana Music Association Lifetime Achievement Award, cementing her legacy as a soul icon residing in Memphis.[1][2][5]
