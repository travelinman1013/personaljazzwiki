## Biography
Butcher Brown is a genre-defying band formed in Richmond, Virginia in 2009, emerging from the city’s vibrant music scene and the jazz program at Virginia Commonwealth University. The founding members—DJ Harrison (Devonne Harris, keys), Corey Fonville (drums), Andrew Randazzo (bass), Marcus 'Tennishu' Tenney (trumpet, saxophone, vocals), and later Morgan Burrs (guitar)—bonded over a shared love of jazz, funk, soul, and hip-hop, often gathering for jam sessions at Harrison’s home studio, Jellowstone. Their early years were marked by a DIY ethos, recording and producing their own music while collaborating with a wide range of local artists and ensembles.

The group’s sound is rooted in jazz fusion but seamlessly incorporates elements of neo-soul, P-funk, boom-bap hip-hop, and psychedelic rock, resulting in a 'musical melting pot' that defies strict categorization. Their discography includes the ambitious debut 'All Purpose Music' (2014), the jazz-funk 'Camden Session' (2018), and the genre-blurring '#KingButch' (2020), among others. Butcher Brown’s live performances, including a celebrated NPR Tiny Desk Concert and tours with artists like Kamasi Washington, have solidified their reputation for energetic improvisation and stylistic versatility. Their legacy is that of a forward-thinking collective that honors tradition while continually pushing boundaries, inspiring a new generation of musicians in and beyond Richmond.
