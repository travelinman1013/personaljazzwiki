## Biography
Tom Grant (born February 22, 1946) is an American smooth jazz and jazz fusion pianist, vocalist, and composer from Portland, Oregon, widely regarded as one of the pioneers of contemporary smooth jazz on the U.S. West Coast.[1][2][9] Raised in a show-business family, he was introduced to music early: his father, a tap dancer and record store owner in Portland, taught him piano and drums, while his older brother—avant‑garde jazz pianist Michael Grant, later known as Mukunda Goswami—exposed him to modern jazz and broader stylistic possibilities.[1][2] Grant studied at the University of Oregon, and after graduating briefly worked as a high‑school teacher before committing fully to music.[2][4] In 1970 he went to New York with Native American saxophonist Jim Pepper, recording on Pepper’s influential track “Witchi‑Tai‑To,” and soon afterward toured and recorded with major jazz figures including Woody Shaw, Joe Henderson, Charles Lloyd, and Tony Williams, gaining a reputation as a versatile and sophisticated pianist.[1][2][4]

In 1976 Grant released his first solo album, *Mystified*, and by 1979 he had formed his own band, transitioning from being a sideman to a bandleader and recording artist.[1][4] Beginning in the early 1980s he increasingly fused jazz harmony and improvisation with pop, R&B grooves, and melodic hooks, creating a series of accessible, radio‑friendly albums—such as *Tom Grant* (1983), *Heart of the City* (1984), *Just the Right Moment* (1985), *Night Charade* (1987), and *Mango Tango* (1988)—that became staples of the emerging smooth jazz and “new adult contemporary” format.[1][2] His recordings frequently reached the top of smooth jazz charts, and he became popular not only across the United States but also in Japan and Indonesia, where he toured extensively.[2] Over a career spanning five decades, Grant has recorded dozens of albums for labels including Timeless, Verve, Shanachie, Windham Hill and his own Nu‑Wrinkle Records, appeared on CNN and *The Tonight Show with Jay Leno*, and remained a central figure in the Portland jazz scene, known for his lyrical touch, swing‑infused phrasing, and ability to bridge straight‑ahead jazz, fusion, pop, and romantic balladry.[1][2][3]

Grant’s musical style is rooted in jazz piano tradition—marked by harmonic sophistication, rhythmic drive, and a strong sense of swing—yet he consistently incorporates contemporary production, R&B‑tinged grooves, and memorable melodies that appeal to broader audiences.[2][9] Often described as walking the line between jazz tradition and modern pop, he helped define the sonic template of mid‑1980s smooth jazz while maintaining improvisational depth drawn from his work with hard‑bop and post‑bop masters.[2][4][9] In addition to his recording output, he has composed music for television and radio, led various small ensembles, and continued to perform regularly in the Pacific Northwest, contributing to the region’s musical identity and mentoring younger players by example.[1][3]
