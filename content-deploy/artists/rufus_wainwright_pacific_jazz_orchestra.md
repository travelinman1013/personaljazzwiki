## Biography
Rufus Wainwright, born in 1973 in Rhinebeck, New York, is an acclaimed singer-songwriter, composer, and pianist, raised in a musical family as the son of folk legends Loudon Wainwright III and Kate McGarrigle. He began playing piano at a young age and gained international attention with his self-titled debut album in 1998, followed by the critically lauded 'Want One' (2003) and 'Want Two' (2004), which showcased his unique blend of pop, classical, and cabaret influences. Wainwright's career has spanned genres and formats, including composing two operas ('Prima Donna' and 'Hadrian'), recreating Judy Garland’s iconic Carnegie Hall concert, and contributing music to film and theatre projects.[5][7]

In 2024, Wainwright collaborated with the Pacific Jazz Orchestra (PJO), a 40-piece Los Angeles-based ensemble led by conductor and arranger Chris Walden, for a project dedicated to the music of Kurt Weill. This collaboration, culminating in the album and concert series 'I'm a Stranger Here Myself – Wainwright Does Weill,' marked Wainwright's first full-length orchestral exploration of Weill’s repertoire, blending jazz, classical, and theatrical traditions. The PJO, known for its diverse and accomplished roster of LA studio musicians, provided a lush, genre-crossing backdrop for Wainwright’s interpretations, further cementing his reputation as a boundary-pushing artist.[1][3][4]

Wainwright’s musical style is characterized by his theatricality, lyrical wit, and ability to traverse genres, drawing from influences as varied as opera, folk, jazz, and European cabaret. His legacy includes not only his own celebrated recordings and compositions but also his role in reviving and reinterpreting the works of past masters, such as Judy Garland and Kurt Weill, for new generations of listeners.[1][5]
