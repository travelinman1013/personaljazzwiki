## Biography
Eva Marie Cassidy was born on February 2, 1963, in Washington, D.C., and became one of the most compelling figures in contemporary music despite remaining virtually unknown outside her native region during her lifetime. She began her professional career at eighteen, singing and playing guitar in a Washington, D.C.-area band called Easy Street, performing at weddings, corporate parties, and local venues. Throughout the 1980s, she worked various jobs including as a plant propagator at a nursery and furniture painter, while simultaneously developing her craft in local clubs. Her recording career began in 1986 when she met bassist and recording engineer Chris Biondo at Black Pond Studios, who recognized her exceptional talent and helped her secure work as a backup singer for various acts, from go-go rhythm and blues bands to rappers.

Cassidy's distinctive artistry lay in her powerful, emotive soprano voice and her ability to reinterpret jazz, folk, and blues standards with profound emotional depth. In 1990, she formed the Eva Cassidy Band with Biondo, Keith Grimes, Lenny Williams, and Raice McLeod, performing frequently throughout the Washington area and earning recognition including two Wammies awards. Her recording career included notable releases such as *The Other Side* (1992), a duet album with go-go musician Chuck Brown, and *Live at Blues Alley* (1996), recorded live in January 1996. Despite her artistic merit, Cassidy famously turned down a recording contract with Blue Note Records in the mid-1990s, refusing to limit herself to jazz exclusively.

Tragically, Cassidy died of melanoma on November 2, 1996, at age 33, just as her career was gaining momentum. Her posthumous legacy, however, became extraordinary—her compilation album *Songbird*, released in 2000, climbed to number one on the UK Albums Chart and sparked worldwide recognition. Her posthumously released recordings have sold more than ten million copies, with three number-one albums and one number-one single in the UK. Her 1996 live recording *Live at Blues Alley* and subsequent compilations introduced her interpretations of standards like "Over the Rainbow" to international audiences, establishing her as one of the most respected vocal interpreters of the late 20th century.

## Fun Facts
- Cassidy famously rejected a recording contract with Blue Note Records because she refused to limit herself to singing only jazz, telling the label's president: 'I don't want to limit myself to singing jazz only, thanks but no thanks.'
- She worked as a plant propagator at a nursery for over a decade (1981-1995) because she wanted to be close to nature, and later painted murals in elementary schools while pursuing her music career.
- During a promotional event for *Live at Blues Alley* in July 1996, Cassidy attributed hip pain to stiffness from painting murals while perched on a stepladder—this pain was actually the first symptom of melanoma that had spread to her bones.
- Her breakthrough came posthumously when BBC Radio 2 producer Paul Walters discovered her in 1997 and played 'Over the Rainbow' on Terry Wogan's show, leading to the release of *Songbird*, which eventually achieved platinum status and introduced her to millions worldwide.
