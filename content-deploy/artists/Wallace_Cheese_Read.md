## Biography
Wallace "Cheese" Read was born on August 12, 1924 (some sources list 1914) in Eunice, Louisiana, a region deeply rooted in Cajun musical traditions due to its cultural isolation during his youth[1][2][3][6]. Raised in Prairie Rhonde near Eunice, Read grew up surrounded by the sounds of Cajun fiddlers and accordionists, absorbing the music that defined southwestern Louisiana. He began playing fiddle at a young age, influenced by the vibrant local scene and the legacy of earlier masters.

Though Read was not a professional musician and rarely performed at dance halls, he became highly respected among his peers for his precise and authentic Cajun fiddling[7][8]. His style was marked by a deep reverence for traditional forms, blending the rhythmic drive of Cajun two-steps and waltzes with subtle melodic ornamentation. Read recorded several tracks for Smithsonian Folkways and Arhoolie, capturing the essence of house parties and informal gatherings that were central to Cajun musical life[8].

Despite a relatively brief career, Read's recordings and collaborations with other local musicians helped preserve and transmit Cajun musical heritage. His legacy endures in the continued appreciation of his work by folklorists and musicians, and his contributions are featured in documentaries and archival collections dedicated to Louisiana's musical history[5][8].
