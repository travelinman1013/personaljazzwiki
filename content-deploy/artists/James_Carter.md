## Biography
James Carter, born January 3, 1969, in Detroit, Michigan, is widely recognized as one of the most charismatic and technically gifted saxophonists of his generation[8]. Raised in a musically vibrant household with five siblings, Carter was exposed to a diverse array of sounds, from The Beatles to funk and Jimi Hendrix, which helped shape his eclectic musical sensibility[1]. By age 17, he was already sharing the stage with jazz luminaries such as Wynton Marsalis, signaling the arrival of a prodigious talent[1].

Carter's career took off with his debut album 'JC on the Set' at age 23, which was hailed as the emergence of a new jazz master[1]. Over the next four decades, he became known for his astonishing command of the saxophone family, as well as flute and clarinet, and for his ability to traverse jazz history in a single performance—from early jazz and jump blues to avant-garde and post-bop[3]. His collaborations span a wide spectrum, including work with Lester Bowie, Julius Hemphill, Dee Dee Bridgewater, Kathleen Battle, Frank Lowe, the World Saxophone Quartet, and Madeleine Peyroux[1]. Carter's technical virtuosity and versatility inspired composer Roberto Sierra to write the celebrated 'Concerto for Saxophones and Orchestra' specifically for him, blending jazz, Latin, and classical elements[2].

Carter's legacy is marked by his role in propelling jazz into the future while maintaining a deep respect for its traditions. He has performed as a soloist with major orchestras worldwide, led his own Organ Trio, Quartet, and Quintet, and appeared on more than 32 recordings[1]. His numerous accolades include multiple DownBeat awards and the prestigious Dr. Alaine Locke Award for exemplary service in promoting African American culture[7].
