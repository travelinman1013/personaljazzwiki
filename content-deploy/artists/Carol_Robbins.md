## Biography
Carol Robbins is a pioneering American jazz harpist, born in Chicago and raised in Los Angeles, whose early exposure to piano and jazz improvisation set the foundation for her unique musical path. By the age of eight, Robbins began studying harp and soon became one of the select few students of Dorothy Ashby, the legendary jazz harpist who revolutionized the instrument’s role in jazz. Robbins’s career has been dedicated to advancing the jazz harp, both as a solo and ensemble instrument, and she is recognized as one of the world’s few jazz harpists to have built a formidable catalog of recordings and performances.

Throughout her career, Robbins has collaborated with an eclectic array of artists, including Billy Childs, Manhattan Transfer, Brian Wilson, Björk, Dianne Reeves, Linda Ronstadt, Nina Simone, Ella Fitzgerald, and Frank Sinatra. She has been a member of Billy Childs’ Jazz Chamber Ensemble since 1999, contributing to Grammy-nominated albums such as 'Lyric' and 'Autumn in Moving Pictures.' Robbins’s discography as a leader includes five albums, notably 'Chords in Blue,' 'Jazz Play,' 'Three and Four,' 'Moraga,' and 'Taylor Street,' the latter of which reflects her compositional voice and the versatility of the jazz harp. Her work as a clinician and educator has further established her legacy, inspiring new generations of harpists and jazz musicians.
