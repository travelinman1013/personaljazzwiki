## Biography
Lonnie Brooks, born Lee Baker Jr. on December 18, 1933, in Dubuisson, Louisiana, was a highly influential American blues singer and guitarist.  His musical journey began with his banjo-playing grandfather, who instilled in him a love for blues music.  However, it wasn't until Brooks moved to Port Arthur, Texas, in the early 1950s, and witnessed live performances by blues legends like Clarence "Gatemouth" Brown, T-Bone Walker, B.B. King, and Long John Hunter, that he seriously considered a music career.  This exposure solidified his passion and inspired him to pursue music professionally.  A pivotal moment came when Clifton Chenier, upon hearing Brooks play on his porch, offered him a position in his touring band.

Initially performing under the name Guitar Jr., Brooks signed with the Goldband label, releasing regional hits like "Family Rules," a song that remains popular in swamp pop circles.  He later moved to Chicago in 1960, adopting the stage name Lonnie Brooks to avoid confusion with another musician using the "Guitar Junior" moniker.  There, he secured consistent gigs in Chicago clubs and surrounding areas, recording numerous singles for various labels including Chess, Chirrup, Mercury, Midas, and USA Records.  He also collaborated with other artists, notably playing guitar on Jimmy Reed's double album *Jimmy Reed at Carnegie Hall* in 1961.  His first album, *Broke and Hungry*, was released by Capitol Records in 1969, followed by *Sweet Home Chicago* for the French label Black & Blue in 1974 after a European tour.  His association with Alligator Records, beginning in 1978 with his inclusion in *Living Chicago Blues*, proved highly significant, leading to the release of several acclaimed albums including *Bayou Lightning*, which won the Grand Prix du Disque Award.  Further collaborations included appearances with Johnny Winter on *Wound Up Tight* and a national tour with B.B. King, Buddy Guy, Koko Taylor, Junior Wells, and Eric Johnson.  He also performed with Eric Clapton in an impromptu jam session.  Later albums included *Roadhouse Rules*, produced by Jim Gaines, and *Lone Star Shootout*, a collaboration with Long John Hunter and Phillip Walker.

Brooks' musical style, sometimes termed "voodoo blues," blended elements of Chicago blues, Louisiana blues, swamp pop, and rhythm and blues.  Critics lauded his "witty, soulful and ferociously energetic" music, praising his innovative harmonic turnarounds, powerful vocals, and astonishing guitar work. His performances were known for their intensity and energy, captivating audiences with his unique blend of styles.  His legacy extends beyond his own prolific career; his sons, Ronnie Baker Brooks and Wayne Baker Brooks, also became successful blues musicians, carrying on the family tradition.  Furthermore, Brooks' influence reached beyond the blues genre, impacting soul artist Reggie Sears.  His contributions to the blues world are further cemented by his co-authorship of *Blues for Dummies* (1998), a book that remains in print.  His appearances in films like *Blues Brothers 2000* and *The Express: The Ernie Davis Story*, and even UK television commercials, broadened his reach and cemented his status as a versatile and influential figure in music.
