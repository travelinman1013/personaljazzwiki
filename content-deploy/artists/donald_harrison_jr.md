## Biography
Donald Harrison Jr., born June 23, 1960, in New Orleans, Louisiana, grew up immersed in the city’s vibrant musical and cultural traditions. His father, Donald Harrison Sr., was a Big Chief in the Mardi Gras Indian community, and this heritage profoundly shaped Harrison’s artistic identity. Harrison studied at the New Orleans Center for the Creative Arts under Ellis Marsalis Jr. before attending Berklee College of Music, graduating in 1981. Early in his career, he played with jazz luminaries such as Roy Haynes, Jack McDuff, and notably, Art Blakey’s Jazz Messengers, alongside fellow New Orleanian Terence Blanchard.

Harrison is celebrated for pioneering 'Nouveau Swing,' a genre-blending style that fuses jazz with R&B, hip-hop, funk, soul, and elements of New Orleans second-line rhythms. His discography includes critically acclaimed albums like 'Indian Blues,' 'Nouveau Swing,' and 'Quantum Leap,' each reflecting his commitment to innovation and tradition. Beyond jazz, he has collaborated with artists across genres, including the Notorious B.I.G., and composed orchestral works such as 'Congo Square Nation.' As Big Chief of the Congo Square Nation Afro-New Orleans Cultural Group, Harrison is a cultural ambassador, educator, and mentor, dedicated to preserving and evolving New Orleans’ musical legacy. He was named an NEA Jazz Master in 2022, the nation’s highest jazz honor, and continues to inspire new generations through his music and educational initiatives.
