## Biography
Israel Vibration is a Jamaican roots reggae harmony group formed by Lascelle 'Wiss' Bulgin (born 1955), Albert 'Apple Gabriel' Craig (born 1955), and Cecil 'Skelly' Spence (born 1952), who all contracted polio during a 1950s epidemic in Jamaica and met as children at the Mona Rehabilitation Clinic in Kingston. As teenagers embracing Rastafarianism, they were expelled from the clinic, turned to street singing for survival, and formalized the group around 1970-1975, initially recording unreleased tracks like 'Bad Intention' at Channel One Studios. Their debut single 'Why Worry' (1976) on the Twelve Tribes label led to opening slots for Bob Marley, Dennis Brown, and Inner Circle, followed by the successful album 'The Same Song' (1978) and dub version with producer Tommy Cowan, establishing their distinctive vibrating harmonies, devotional lyrics, and roots reggae style.[1][2][3][4][5]
