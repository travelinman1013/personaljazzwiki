## Biography
Bessie Smith and Louis Armstrong represent two of the most influential figures in early jazz and blues history, though they were distinct artists with different specializations. Bessie Smith, born at the turn of the century, became known as the 'Empress of the Blues' and rose to prominence as a vaudeville performer who grew up in poverty in Chattanooga, Tennessee, busking on the streets to support her impoverished family. By age 24, she had her own solo acts and was performing throughout the South and East Coast. In 1923, she signed with Columbia Records, and her first recording, 'Down-hearted Blues,' became a major hit that launched her into the national spotlight, eventually making her the highest-paid Black entertainer of her time. Her genuine performances connected deeply with record buyers, and she devoted herself primarily to the blues repertoire, which often explored themes of sadness, abandonment, and loneliness.

Louis Armstrong, also born at the turn of the century, emerged as the first great soloist in jazz history and the primary protagonist of jazz's evolution from collective New Orleans music to a form emphasizing individual improvisation. Armstrong's genuine, conversational voice and innovative trumpet playing made trained, affected vocal styles seem wooden by comparison, and he became an international star and the first true ambassador of jazz to the world. While Armstrong and Smith came from similar generational backgrounds and both achieved remarkable success as Black entertainers during the Jazz Age, they followed different career trajectories—Smith remained rooted in vaudeville and blues traditions, while Armstrong became a global phenomenon.

Their most celebrated collaboration occurred on January 14, 1925, when they met in Columbia Record's New York recording studio with pianist Fred Longshaw to record five songs in a single session. This legendary session produced what many consider classics, including their definitive version of W.C. Handy's 'St. Louis Blues,' which became the standard recording of that composition. Despite Smith's initial reluctance to record with Armstrong (she reportedly preferred cornetist Joe Smith as an accompanist), the two musicians developed instant rapport. Armstrong's accompaniment was masterful and adaptive—he changed the sound of his horn for each performance, using a straight mute on 'St. Louis Blues,' a plunger on 'Reckless Blues,' open horn on 'Sobbin' Hearted Blues,' and wah-wah style on 'Cold In Hand Blues.' Their interplay on these recordings demonstrated a sophisticated musical understanding, with Armstrong never stepping on Smith's vocals and always knowing the perfect phrase for the spaces she left open, creating what was essentially a duet rather than a simple vocal with instrumental accompaniment.

## Fun Facts
- Bessie Smith's success was so remarkable that she had her own railway carriage dedicated entirely to her company, reflecting her status as the highest-paid Black entertainer of her time.
- Despite being reluctant to record with Louis Armstrong on January 14, 1925, Bessie Smith and Armstrong recorded five classics in a single session—a feat many artists never achieve in their entire lifetime, with not a single 'throwaway' or 'lesser' track among them.
- Armstrong demonstrated remarkable musical adaptability during the 1925 session with Smith, changing the sound of his trumpet for each of the five songs recorded that day, using different muting techniques to complement Smith's vocals without overshadowing her.
- The song 'Cold In Hand Blues' from the legendary 1925 session was credited to Smith's husband Jack Gee and pianist Fred Longshaw, though it's quite possible that Bessie Smith herself composed the lyrics, reflecting her creative contributions beyond her vocal performances.
