## Biography
New Orleans High Society is a jazz ensemble founded in New Orleans, Louisiana, the historic birthplace of jazz. The group began with a weekly residency, where its members developed a unique approach to the New Orleans jazz repertoire, blending traditional jazz foundations with elements of Afro-Cuban rhythms, gospel harmonies, and modern trip-hop textures. This fusion of styles, shaped by the diverse backgrounds and musical interests of the band members, quickly set them apart in the city's vibrant music scene.

After playing together for over 18 months, the band recorded their self-titled debut album, released in 2020. The core lineup featured Cleveland Donald (trumpet, lead vocals), David Bode (saxophones, clarinet), Peter Gustafson (trombone), Yacine Sebti (piano, lead vocals), Steven Bohnstengel (bass), and Trenton O’Neal (drums, percussion), with special guest vocalist Angie Z. The album showcases their reinterpretations of classic New Orleans standards, highlighting both their technical skill and creative chemistry. Following the recording, Angie Z became a full-time vocalist after Cleveland Donald relocated to Marseille, France. Despite challenges posed by the pandemic, the band continued to plan new recordings and performances, maintaining their commitment to revitalizing traditional jazz for contemporary audiences.

New Orleans High Society is celebrated for their energetic live shows and innovative arrangements, which honor the legacy of New Orleans jazz while pushing its boundaries. Their collaborative spirit and modern sensibility have earned them recognition as one of the most exciting young ensembles in the city’s jazz community.
