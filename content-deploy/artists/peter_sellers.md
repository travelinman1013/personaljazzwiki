## Biography
Peter Richard Henry Sellers, better known as Peter Sellers, was born on 8 September 1925 in Southsea, Portsmouth, England, into a touring vaudeville family.[1][8] His parents, Bill and Peg Sellers, were both variety and concert-hall performers, and his father in particular was a pianist and entertainer who hoped his son would become a professional piano player.[1][8] Instead, the young Sellers gravitated toward drums, ukulele, banjo, and general stage work, appearing in revue as a child and later working as a drummer in dance and jazz bands during his teens.[3][4][8] World War II took him into the Royal Air Force, where he joined ENSA and RAF entertainment units, developing his mimicry, comedy timing, and musical novelty routines while entertaining troops across India, Burma, the Middle East, and Europe.[2][3]

After demobilization in 1946, Sellers endured several lean years as an entertainment director at a holiday camp and as a club comic, often using ukulele and comic songs in variety acts such as the duo Altman and Sellers.[2][3][4][8] His breakthrough came with radio: by audaciously phoning a BBC producer while impersonating established radio stars to “recommend” himself, he secured his first major radio work, which soon led to his starring role on the influential BBC comedy series *The Goon Show* (1951–1960).[2][3][4][8] Parallel to his rising profile as a film actor, he built a distinct musical and spoken‑word recording career, cutting comedy singles and musical parodies produced by George Martin, who later became famous as the Beatles’ producer.[1][7] Sellers’ records, such as his hit versions of “Any Old Iron” (1957), “Goodness Gracious Me” (1960, with Sophia Loren), and a comic “A Hard Day’s Night” (1966), showcased his ability to fuse character acting, accents, and song into tightly crafted novelty performances that straddled comedy, music-hall, and pop pastiche.[1][7]

Sellers’ musical style was rooted in British music‑hall, vaudeville, and novelty song traditions, but he expanded these with sharp vocal mimicry and conceptual parody, sending up folk, jazz, popular standards, and contemporary rock.[1] He recorded Lennon–McCartney material in deliberately incongruous styles—reciting “A Hard Day’s Night” as if he were Laurence Olivier’s Richard III, or delivering “Help!” as a mock-sermon—turning familiar pop texts into showcases for vocal character work and satire.[1] Even when his international reputation became dominated by film roles such as Inspector Clouseau in *The Pink Panther* series and his multiple characters in Stanley Kubrick’s *Dr. Strangelove*, he continued to play drums and ukulele privately and to approach performance with a musician’s sense of rhythm and phrasing.[1][3][5] His comic records remained popular long after his death in 1980, frequently selected on BBC’s *Desert Island Discs* and cited by later British comedians and satirists as exemplars of character‑driven audio comedy that blurred the line between spoken word, song, and sketch.[1][6]

## Fun Facts
- Sellers’ father was born Bill Seller and later added an “s” to the family surname, so Peter Sellers grew up with a slightly modified stage name as his legal name.[1]
- Before becoming famous, Sellers once cold‑called a BBC producer while impersonating well‑known radio stars Richard Murdoch and Kenneth Horne, pretending they were recommending him; the stunt worked and helped secure his first significant BBC radio spot.[2][8]
- His novelty single “Any Old Iron” (1957) and later comedy songs like “Goodness Gracious Me” (1960) and a comic version of “A Hard Day’s Night” (1966) all reached the UK Top 20, giving a major film comedian an unusual parallel career as a charting recording artist.[1]
- While shooting the 1968 film *The Party*, Sellers took sitar lessons from Ravi Shankar, the virtuoso who was also a close friend of George Harrison, adding Indian classical technique to his eclectic musical experiences.[1]

(His work on *The Goon Show* and novelty recordings such as Beatles parodies and music-hall send‑ups cited in retrospectives as key influences.) [From the 1960s onward]
- [[comedy_and_novelty_recording_artists|Comedy and novelty recording artists]] - Sellers’ charting comedy singles and cross‑media profile (film, radio, records) helped legitimize novelty records as a creative field, influencing later musical satirists and comic recording artists in the UK.
