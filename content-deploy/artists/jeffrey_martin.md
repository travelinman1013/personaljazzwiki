## Biography
Jeffrey Martin is a Portland, Oregon-based singer-songwriter known for his introspective folk and americana music, growing up as the son of a preacher man in Oregon. He began playing guitar in college initially for fun, then backing open mic nights, before performing his own songs, inspired by a transformative Josh Ritter concert that ignited his passion for folk music and songwriting. After humble beginnings, he was discovered at his weekly gig at Lucky's in Eugene, Oregon, opening for David Wilcox, which jumpstarted his career with regular West Coast gigs; he released his debut album *Gold in the Water* in 2009.[3][7][8]

Martin initially pursued music hoping for fame but faced challenges with apathetic bar crowds and financial struggles, leading him to return to school for a teaching degree and work as a high school English teacher, which he grew to love for its energy and humility. He continued writing songs daily alongside teaching, eventually quitting to tour full-time, reflecting on the human condition through his insightful lyrics. His career has steadily built with albums and constant touring, culminating in announcements like his first live album *Alive July 25, 2025*, set for release in 2026.[5][7][8][9]

His musical style draws from working-class roots and folk traditions, delivering sensitive, narrative-driven songs that resonate in rust-belt and americana scenes, with a Spotify popularity of 38 in the americana genre.
