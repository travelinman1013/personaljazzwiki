## Biography
Randall Stuart Newman was born on November 28, 1943, in Los Angeles, California, into a prominent musical family known as one of America's most nominated Academy Award extended families in music categories. From an early age, he showed prodigious talent, writing songs professionally by age 17 and working as a staff writer for publishing companies like Metric Music and January Music. His early hits included 'Just One Mile,' 'I Don't Want to Hear it Anymore,' 'I Think It's Going to Rain Today,' and 'Simon Smith and His Dancing Bear.' Newman released his debut album in 1968 with Warner Bros., followed by critically acclaimed works like Sail Away (1972), Good Old Boys (1974), and Little Criminals (1977), which entered the top ten and went gold. His songwriting style is characterized by irony, satire, character-driven narratives, and social commentary, often delivered with a gravelly voice and piano accompaniment, earning him a cult following.[1][3][5]
