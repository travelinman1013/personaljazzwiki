## Biography
Organic Trio is a contemporary jazz group formed by guitarist Brian Seeger, French organist Jean-Yves Jung, and Luxembourgish drummer Paul Wiltgen. The trio originated from New Orleans, a city renowned for its vibrant jazz scene, and their music reflects a blend of American jazz roots with European influences. Seeger, a mainstay in New Orleans jazz, brings a deep understanding of the city's traditions and a penchant for melodic improvisation, while Jung and Wiltgen add international flair and technical prowess to the ensemble.

The group is celebrated for their intuitive interplay, creative arrangements, and a sound that is both modern and rooted in the classic organ trio tradition. Their debut album, 'Home Remembered,' was recorded at the University of New Orleans studio and features original compositions by Seeger that showcase the trio's dynamic range and melodic sensibility. Their follow-up, 'Saturn’s Spell,' further established their reputation, earning critical acclaim and chart success. Organic Trio's style is characterized by soulful grooves, uncluttered textures, and a willingness to explore unusual rhythms and free jazz moments, all while maintaining a natural, organic feel.

Each member brings a wealth of experience: Seeger is a respected educator and performer who has worked with jazz legends like Dr. Lonnie Smith and Big John Patton; Jung is known for his work with Bireli Lagrene and other European jazz greats; and Wiltgen is an accomplished drummer and composer who has collaborated with leading figures on the international jazz scene. Together, they have created a unique voice in contemporary jazz, blending tradition with innovation.
