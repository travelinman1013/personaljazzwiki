## Biography
Shirley Horn (May 1, 1934 – October 20, 2005) was an acclaimed American jazz singer and pianist renowned for her subtle, slow-tempo ballads and her unique ability to accompany her own vocals with sensitive, expressive piano playing. Born and raised in Washington, D.C., Horn began piano lessons at age four and studied classical music at Howard University’s Junior School of Music by age twelve. Though she won a scholarship to Juilliard, she remained in D.C. due to financial constraints, immersing herself in the local jazz scene and forming her own trio by age twenty.

Horn’s breakthrough came in 1960 when her debut album, 'Embers and Ashes,' caught the attention of Miles Davis, who invited her to open for him at the Village Vanguard. This led to recording opportunities with Mercury Records and collaborations with jazz luminaries such as Quincy Jones. Despite early success, Horn chose to prioritize her family, performing mainly in Washington, D.C., for over a decade. Her career resurged in the late 1970s and flourished in the 1980s and 1990s with a series of highly regarded albums for Verve Records, including 'You Won’t Forget Me' (1990) and the Grammy-winning 'I Remember Miles' (1998). Horn’s understated, intimate style and mastery of both voice and piano left a lasting mark on jazz, earning her critical acclaim and a devoted international following.
