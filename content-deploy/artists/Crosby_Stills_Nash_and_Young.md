## Biography
Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young (CSNY) is a legendary American folk rock supergroup formed in 1968, consisting of David Crosby (formerly of the Byrds), Stephen Stills (Buffalo Springfield), Graham Nash (the Hollies), and later Neil Young (Buffalo Springfield). The group emerged from the vibrant music scene of the late 1960s, with each member bringing a distinct background and songwriting prowess. Their debut as a trio, Crosby, Stills & Nash, was marked by intricate vocal harmonies and a blend of folk, rock, and pop influences, quickly earning them critical acclaim and commercial success with hits like "Suite: Judy Blue Eyes" and "Marrakesh Express".

The addition of Neil Young in 1969 transformed the group into CSNY, further expanding their musical palette and political voice. Their first album as a quartet, "Déjà Vu" (1970), became a landmark release, featuring enduring songs such as "Teach Your Children" and "Ohio," the latter addressing the Kent State shootings and cementing their reputation for socially conscious lyrics. Despite frequent internal conflicts and lineup changes, the group continued to release influential albums and perform at historic events like Woodstock, leaving a lasting impact on American music and culture.

CSNY's legacy is defined by their masterful harmonies, innovative songwriting, and outspoken activism. Their music not only captured the spirit of their era but also influenced generations of artists. The group experienced multiple reunions and separations, with each member pursuing successful solo careers alongside their collaborative work. The passing of David Crosby in 2023 marked the end of an era, but the band's influence endures in the realms of folk, rock, and protest music.
