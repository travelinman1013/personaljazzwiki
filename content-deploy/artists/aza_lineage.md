## Biography
Dana Bernard, known as Aza Lineage, is a self-taught lyricist born in 1989 in Kingston 7, Jamaica, to teenage parents. Raised in the challenging inner-city communities of Hermitage and August Town amid her extended family, including her grandmother, she was deeply influenced by reggae and dancehall music from an early age. Her passion for the genre led her to develop her skills as a singer, singjay, and writer, drawing from the rich history of Jamaican music culture, including singers, producers, soundsystem operators, and promoters.[1][3][6][7]

Aza Lineage's career gained momentum through grassroots performances on small soundsystems in Kingston, where she showcased original songs like 'Soundsystem,' written in 2016. A pivotal connection formed when her associate Smiles introduced her to legendary producer King Jammy, resulting in a rapid studio session and her feature on the album 'Tracks Of Life' alongside Dennis Brown. This mentorship has shaped her vocal and writing abilities, positioning her as a rising voice in roots reggae and the roots side of dancehall. She continues working with King Jammy on new projects, contributing fresh energy to the reggae landscape with tracks like 'Melody' and 'Sound System.'[2][4]

Her musical style blends reggae, dub, roots reggae, and ragga, rooted in Jamaica's foundational sounds while addressing shared experiences and emotions. As a female artist in a male-dominated field, Aza Lineage draws inspiration from trailblazers like the I-Threes, Marcia Griffiths, and modern figures such as Lila Ike and Koffee, advocating for greater confidence and visibility for women in the genre.[4]
