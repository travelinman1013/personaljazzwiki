## Biography
Wire are a British rock band formed in London in October 1976, emerging from the punk scene around the Roxy Club but quickly pushing beyond its boundaries.[1][3][4] The classic early lineup featured Colin Newman (vocals, guitar), Bruce Gilbert (guitar), Graham Lewis (bass, vocals) and Robert Grey, then known as Robert Gotobed (drums), with an earlier, short-lived role for guitarist George Gill.[1][2] Originating from Watford and North London art-school circles, they were signed to EMI soon after their first Roxy shows and released their debut album *Pink Flag* (1977), a stark, minimalist record whose short, fragmented songs became a touchstone for punk, post‑punk and later hardcore.[1][3][4] Rapid evolution followed with *Chairs Missing* (1978) and *154* (1979), where the band folded in art-rock, experimental electronics and a more atmospheric, song‑based approach that helped define post‑punk’s shift from raw energy to conceptual and textural exploration.[1][3][4]

After disbanding in 1980, the members pursued solo and avant‑garde projects before reconvening in 1985 with a more electronically driven sound that aligned them with the 1980s’ machine‑music landscape rather than their punk roots.[1][2][4] Drummer Robert Gotobed left in 1990, leading the remaining trio to briefly rename themselves Wir and further pursue studio experimentation before another hiatus in the early 1990s.[1][2][4] Wire re‑emerged as a full‑time band in 1999 with Grey back on drums, issuing the album *Send* (2003) and continuing into the 21st century with new guitarist Matt Simms joining in 2010.[1][2][4] Across decades, their music has retained a forward‑looking, concept‑driven ethos—eschewing nostalgia tours in favor of new material—and their influence can be heard in alternative rock, indie, hardcore, and experimental scenes, with their early work in particular widely cited as foundational for generations of art‑punk and post‑punk bands.[1][3][4][6]

Stylistically, Wire are noted for combining punk’s concision with conceptual rigor, abstract and often oblique lyrics, and an interest in texture and structure drawn from art-school and experimental traditions.[3][4][7] *Pink Flag* distilled rock to ultra‑short, riff‑based blasts; *Chairs Missing* introduced synths, studio effects and more developed song forms; and *154* pushed into atmospheric, fragmented art‑rock.[1][3][4][7] Their continued later work—spanning 1980s electronic experiments, 2000s guitar‑driven releases, and 2010s albums that balance melody and abrasion—has cemented their reputation as one of post‑punk’s most consistently innovative and self‑reinventing bands, frequently cited by critics as a group whose influence outstrips their commercial profile.[1][3][4][6][7]

## Fun Facts
- After drummer Robert Gotobed left in 1990, the remaining members dropped the final “e” from their name and released material as **Wir**, underlining how central his drumming was to their identity.[1][2][4]
- Wire’s debut album *Pink Flag* contains 21 tracks but runs for only about 35 minutes, with many songs lasting well under two minutes, making it an iconic example of radically concise song‑writing.[1][6][7]
- The band have repeatedly refused to become a nostalgia act: when they re‑formed in the 1980s and again in the 2000s, they deliberately avoided reproducing their 1970s sound and instead treated each phase as a conceptual “year zero.”[3][4]
- Colin Newman has described consciously trying to “reinvent rock ’n’ roll” in his Watford bedroom in 1977, deciding to strip out the “’n’ roll” and apply strict principles to songwriting, an attitude that shaped *Pink Flag*’s stark, rule‑driven construction.[3]

## Musical Connections

### Mentors/Influences
- [[sex_pistols|Sex Pistols]] - Part of the same mid‑1970s London punk explosion that provided the initial environment and catalyst for Wire’s formation and early sound, even as Wire quickly reacted against standard punk forms.[3][6] (Early London punk singles and gigs that defined the 1976–77 scene, against which *Pink Flag* was conceived.[3][6]) [1976–1978]
- [[buzzcocks|Buzzcocks]] - Their EP *Spiral Scratch* is cited by Colin Newman as a stark, minimalist punk record that pointed toward the kind of stripped‑down, concept‑driven approach Wire would pursue.[3] (The EP *Spiral Scratch* (1977) as a model of minimalist, independent punk.[3]) [Mid‑1970s–late 1970s]
- [[roxy_music|Roxy Music]] - An older art‑rock band with whom Wire toured, exposing Wire to a more avant‑garde, art‑school tradition that aligned with their own conceptual ambitions.[5] (Joint tours rather than specific studio collaborations; Roxy Music’s art‑rock catalog served as a broader aesthetic reference.[5]) [Late 1970s]

### Key Collaborators
- [[bruce_gilbert|Bruce Gilbert]] - Founding guitarist and key architect of the band’s early experimental textures and conceptual approach; later active in side projects such as Dome and Cupol with Graham Lewis.[1][2] (Wire albums *Pink Flag*, *Chairs Missing*, *154*, *The Ideal Copy*, *A Bell Is a Cup… Until It Is Struck*, plus side projects Dome and related releases.[1][2]) [1976–1980; 1985–1990; returned for 1999 shows and left again by 2004]
- [[graham_lewis|Graham Lewis]] - Bassist, vocalist and co‑lyricist whose abstract, often dark texts and interest in experimental music shaped Wire’s post‑punk identity; collaborator with Bruce Gilbert in Dome and other projects.[1][2][7] (Core member on virtually all Wire albums; co‑creator of Dome, Cupol and other early 1980s experimental releases.[1][2][7]) [1976–present (with hiatuses matching the band’s breaks)]
- [[robert_grey_robert_gotobed|Robert Grey (Robert Gotobed)]] - Drummer whose precise, economical style was central to Wire’s minimalist early sound; his departure led to the Wir phase and his return underpinned the band’s 2000s reactivation.[1][2][4] (Wire’s 1977–1990 albums including *Pink Flag*, *Chairs Missing*, *154*, *The Ideal Copy*, *Manscape*; post‑reunion albums like *Send*.[1][2][4]) [1976–1990; 1999–present]
- [[margaret_fiedler_mcginnis|Margaret Fiedler McGinnis]] - Laika guitarist who joined Wire as a touring guitarist during the 2000s, helping fill the gap after Bruce Gilbert’s departure.[2][4] (Live performances with Wire in the late 2000s; not generally credited as a core studio member.[2][4]) [Circa 2008–2010]
- [[matt_simms|Matt Simms]] - Guitarist from the band It Hugs Back who initially joined Wire as a touring member and became a full‑time member, contributing to 2010s recordings and tours.[2][4] (Wire albums and tours from around 2010 onward, including later‑period studio work.[2][4]) [2010–present]
- [[jake_and_dinos_chapman|Jake and Dinos Chapman]] - Visual artists who collaborated with Wire on cross‑disciplinary projects, extending the band’s longstanding engagement with contemporary art.[2] (Collaborative projects in the early 2000s linked to the *Send* era.[2]) [Early 2000s]
- [[es_devlin|Es Devlin]] - Stage designer who worked with Wire on live presentation, reflecting their interest in the visual and conceptual framing of performance.[2] (Stage and set collaborations around tours in the early 2000s.[2]) [Early 2000s]

### Artists Influenced
- [[minor_threat_and_early_hardcore_punk_bands|Minor Threat and early hardcore punk bands]] - Wire’s ultra‑short, high‑intensity songs on *Pink Flag* are frequently cited as a structural and aesthetic precedent for American hardcore’s brevity and directness.[1][6][7] (Wire’s *Pink Flag* (1977) as a template for hardcore song length and attack; reflected in early Minor Threat and related Dischord releases.[1][6][7]) [Early 1980s onward]
- [[elastica|Elastica]] - The Britpop band Elastica drew directly from Wire’s material, most notably echoing the riff and structure of Wire’s “Three Girl Rhumba” in their hit “Connection,” a case widely discussed as an example of Wire’s hidden but concrete impact.[1][7] (Wire’s “Three Girl Rhumba” from *Pink Flag* and Elastica’s single “Connection,” which closely mirrors its guitar figure.[1][7]) [Mid‑1990s]
- [[postpunk_and_indie_bands_e.g._sonic_youth_guided_by_voices_blur-era_artrock_acts|Post‑punk and indie bands (e.g., Sonic Youth, Guided by Voices, Blur-era art‑rock acts)]] - Critics and histories of alternative rock frequently place Wire as a foundational influence on art‑punk and post‑punk guitar bands that adopted dissonance, abstraction and conceptual rigor.[3][4][7] (Wire’s first three albums—*Pink Flag*, *Chairs Missing*, *154*—are often cited in interviews and criticism as reference points for later post‑punk and indie experimentation.[1][3][4][7]) [Mid‑1980s onward]
