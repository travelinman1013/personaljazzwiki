## Biography
Syl Johnson, born Sylvester Thompson on July 1, 1936, in Holly Springs, Mississippi, was a pioneering American blues and soul singer, musician, songwriter, and record producer. Raised in a musical family as the sixth child of a harmonica-playing farmer, Johnson moved to Chicago around 1950, where he was immersed in the city's vibrant blues scene. His early musical education came from playing alongside legends such as Magic Sam (his next-door neighbor), Billy Boy Arnold, [[01_Projects/PersonalArtistWiki/Artists/Junior_Wells]], and Howlin' Wolf during the 1950s. Johnson's recording career began in 1959 with the single "Teardrops" on Federal Records, backed by Freddie King, though early commercial success eluded him and he supported himself as a truck driver[1]. Johnson's breakthrough came in the mid-1960s when he signed with Chicago's Twilight/Twinight Records, scoring hits like "Come On Sock It to Me" and "Different Strokes," the latter becoming a foundational breakbeat sampled by countless hip-hop artists. His socially conscious 1969 single "Is It Because I'm Black" reached number 11 on the Billboard R&B chart and remains a poignant anthem of the civil rights era[1]. In the 1970s, Johnson moved to Memphis and recorded four acclaimed albums for Hi Records, working with producer Willie Mitchell, though he never achieved the crossover pop success of labelmate Al Green[3]. After a period of semi-retirement in the 1980s, during which he focused on business ventures, Johnson returned to music in the 1990s, spurred by the widespread sampling of his work by hip-hop artists. He released the album Back in the Game in 1994 and became an outspoken advocate for artists' rights, pursuing legal action over unauthorized samples of his music[1]. Johnson's musical style blended raw blues intensity with soulful grooves and funk rhythms, and his legacy endures as one of the most sampled artists in hip-hop history, as well as a vital voice in the soul and blues canon.

## Fun Facts
- Syl Johnson’s stage name was suggested by King Records owner Syd Nathan, who thought “Syl Johnson” sounded better than his birth name, Sylvester Thompson[1][2].
- Johnson’s song “Different Strokes” is one of the most sampled tracks in hip-hop history, appearing in songs by Wu-Tang Clan, Public Enemy, and many others[1].
- After semi-retiring from music in the 1980s, Johnson opened a chain of seafood restaurants and invested in real estate[1].
- Johnson’s 2015 documentary, Any Way the Wind Blows, explores his quest for recognition and the impact of sampling on his career and legacy[1].
