# the ruiners

## Quick Info
- **Genres**: horror punk, psychobilly, deathrock
- **Spotify Popularity**: 8/100
- **Followers**: 2,428
- **Origin**: Detroit, Michigan, United States

## Biography
The Ruiners are a **Detroit, Michigan** punk band known for fusing trashy glam rock attitude with garage punk energy, surf‑tinged guitars, and flashes of rockabilly psychobilly chaos.[5][6] Emerging from Detroit’s long lineage of sleazy, high‑octane rock ’n’ roll, they were founded by singer and guitarist **Rick Ruiner**, who started the band with a high‑school friend and slowly honed it from a self‑confessed “pretty terrible” early project into a tightly drilled, theatrical live act built around wild shows and hook‑heavy, fuzz‑drenched songs.[4][6] Over the last decade‑plus, they have become a fixture in the Detroit underground, regularly headlining local venues and bowling‑alley clubs, and releasing recordings that capture their mix of garage grit, punk immediacy, and glam spectacle.[5][9]

Stylistically, The Ruiners are often described as **garage punk and glam rock**, with “buzzing surf guitars that evolve into rockabilly psych freakouts,” a sound that aligns naturally with horror‑ and B‑movie aesthetics and the broader psychobilly/deathrock universe noted on platforms like Spotify.[6] Their songs are typically written and arranged in a very direct, live‑in‑the‑room fashion; for at least one release, they wrote material in the studio and recorded it live on the spot, emphasizing spontaneity over polish and leaning into the rawness that defines their shows.[7] Onstage, they embrace outrageous costumes, campy theatrics, and a confrontational, party‑starting presence, drawing on Detroit’s legacy of Iggy‑style chaos and glitter‑rock showmanship while cultivating a cult following across local clubs and niche punk/garage circles beyond the city.[5][6][8][9]

While The Ruiners have not reached mainstream fame, their legacy is rooted in sustained activity and influence within Detroit’s rock underbelly: more than ten years of “rockin’ your world,” as one feature put it, constant gigging, and a reputation for turning small rooms into full‑blown punk‑glam spectacles that highlight the enduring vitality of DIY rock in the Motor City.[9][5][6]

## Fun Facts
- Band founder **Rick Ruiner** openly admits that The Ruiners were “pretty terrible in the beginning,” emphasizing how the group evolved over years of trial, error, and relentless gigging into a much sharper live band.[4]
- For at least one of their releases, The Ruiners wrote the songs directly in the studio and recorded them live as they were written, a risky, off‑the‑cuff method that fit their trashy garage‑punk ethos.[7]
- The Ruiners are known in Detroit for raucous sets at non‑traditional rock spaces like **Bowlero Lanes & Lounge** (a bowling alley venue in Royal Oak), highlighting their affinity for turning any room into a chaotic rock ’n’ roll party.[5]
