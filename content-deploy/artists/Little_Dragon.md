## Biography
Little Dragon is a Swedish electronic music group formed in 1996 in Gothenburg, Sweden, by lead vocalist Yukimi Nagano, bassist Fredrik Källgren Wallin, drummer Erik Bodin, and keyboardist Håkan Wirenstrand. Nagano, who began writing poetry and lyrics at a young age, joined forces with her school friends to create a band that would soon become known for its genre-defying blend of soulful pop, R&B, and electronic music. The group’s name reportedly comes from a nickname given to Nagano for her fiery studio temperament during their early years.

The band’s breakthrough came with the single 'Twice,' which led to their self-titled debut album in 2007. Over the years, Little Dragon has developed a reputation for their unique sound—marked by off-kilter rhythms, lush synths, and Nagano’s distinctive vocals—and for their fiercely independent approach, often recording and producing their albums in their home-built Gothenburg studio. Their discography includes acclaimed albums such as 'Machine Dreams,' 'Ritual Union,' and 'New Me, Same Us,' and their 2023 release 'Slugs of Love' was described by the band as their 'finest work yet.'

Little Dragon’s influence and appeal have made them one of the most respected bands in contemporary electronic music. Their Grammy-nominated work and high-profile collaborations have cemented their legacy as innovators, while their music continues to inspire a wide range of artists and attract a devoted international fanbase.
