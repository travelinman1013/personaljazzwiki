## Biography
Eva Narcissus Boyd, known professionally as Little Eva, was born on June 29, 1943, in Belhaven, North Carolina, one of twelve siblings. At age fifteen, she relocated to the Brighton Beach section of Brooklyn, New York, where she initially worked as a babysitter and maid to support herself. Her entry into the music industry came through an unexpected avenue: while working as a nanny for songwriters Carole King and Gerry Goffin, they discovered her singing voice and dancing ability. Impressed by her talent, King and Goffin wrote "The Loco-Motion" for her, originally intended as a demo for another artist. Producer Don Kirshner of Dimension Records recognized the song's potential and released it commercially, launching Boyd to stardom when the track reached number one on the United States charts in 1962 at just sixteen years old.

Despite being remembered by many as a one-hit wonder, Little Eva recorded several successful follow-up singles throughout the early 1960s, including "Keep Your Hands Off My Baby" (which reached number twelve), "Let's Turkey Trot" (number twenty), and a duet with Big Dee Irwin titled "Swinging on a Star." Her vocal style possessed a distinctive sullen edge that worked particularly well when portraying emotional vulnerability in her material. However, after being stereotyped as a dance-craze singer and receiving limited quality material, her commercial appeal declined significantly after 1964. She continued touring and recording throughout the 1960s while occasionally performing with The Cookies and providing background vocals for artists like The Drifters and Ben E. King, but ultimately retired from the music industry in 1971.

After years of obscurity living in North Carolina with her three children, Little Eva experienced a resurgence of interest in 1988 following the success of Kylie Minogue's cover of "The Loco-Motion." This renewed attention allowed her to make a comeback, performing on the cabaret and oldies circuits with contemporaries such as Bobby Vee. She continued performing until her death on April 10, 2003, in Kinston, North Carolina, leaving behind a legacy as an important figure in early 1960s pop and doo-wop music.

## Fun Facts

- The only existing footage of Little Eva performing "The Loco-Motion" is a brief clip from the ABC television show "Shindig!" in the 1960s, where she performed the song with the famous dance steps.
- Her gravestone, installed in July 2008, features an image of a locomotive in honor of her signature song and bears the epitaph "Singing with the Angels."
- Little Eva was scheduled to perform at Dick Clark's Caravan of Stars tour in Dallas, Texas on November 22, 1963, but the event was cancelled moments after President John F. Kennedy was assassinated that evening.
