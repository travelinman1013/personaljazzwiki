## Biography
Jair Rodrigues M. Oliveira, widely known as **Jairzinho Oliveira**, is a Brazilian composer, singer, songwriter, arranger and producer born on March 17, 1975, in São Paulo, Brazil.[1][9] Son of renowned samba singer Jair Rodrigues and brother of vocalist Luciana Mello, he grew up in a deeply musical household that immersed him in samba, MPB (Música Popular Brasileira), soul and pop from an early age.[1][8][9] As a child in the early 1980s he became a national TV personality as a co‑star on the hugely popular children’s program *Balão Mágico* and a member of its associated pop group Turma do Balão Mágico, which sold more than 13 million records and made him one of Brazil’s best‑known child singers.[1][3]

In the 1990s Oliveira moved to the United States to study at Berklee College of Music in Boston, graduating in 1998 with training in Music Production & Engineering and Music Business, an education that helped shape his later work as a producer and label‑connected recording artist.[1][7] Returning to Brazil, he emerged as a key figure in a new generation of MPB artists through the *Projeto Artistas Reunidos* collective, which fused classic samba and bossa nova with soul, funk and electronica and included peers such as Luciana Mello, João Marcelo Bôscoli, Pedro Mariano, Daniel Carlomagno and brothers Max de Castro and Wilson Simoninha.[1][7] From the early 2000s he released a string of solo albums—such as *Disritmia* (2001), *Outro* (2002), *Brazilian Love Affair* (2002), *3.1* and *3.2* (2003), *Simples* (2006) and *Sambazz* (2010)—showcasing a sophisticated blend of samba, jazz, pop, soul and MPB that critics have described as part of a contemporary “second‑generation” Brazilian sound.[1][7] His 2019 album *Selfie* earned a Latin Grammy nomination for Best Portuguese Language Contemporary Pop Album, cementing his status as an innovative voice in modern Brazilian music.[1][5]

Oliveira’s style is marked by polished arrangements, groove‑oriented rhythms and harmonically rich songwriting that bridges traditional Brazilian genres with global contemporary influences.[4][6][7] In addition to his recording career, he has worked as an arranger and producer through his own production ventures, contributing to Brazil’s contemporary music scene both behind the console and on stage.[2][4][5] He has also acted in film and television, and continues to perform in projects that often highlight his family’s musical legacy, including shows with his sister Luciana Mello paying tribute to their father’s classic repertoire while updating it with their own soulful, jazz‑inflected approach.[1][4]
