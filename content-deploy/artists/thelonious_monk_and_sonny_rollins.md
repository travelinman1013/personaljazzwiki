## Biography
Thelonious Monk and Sonny Rollins, two titans of jazz, first crossed paths in Harlem during the late 1940s and early 1950s, a period that saw the birth of bebop and hard bop. Monk, born in Rocky Mount, North Carolina in 1917, was a pioneering pianist and composer known for his angular melodies, unique harmonies, and percussive playing style. By the time Rollins, a prodigious tenor saxophonist from New York City born in 1930, was coming of age, Monk had already established himself as a central figure in the bebop movement, performing at legendary venues like Minton's Playhouse and collaborating with innovators such as Kenny Clarke and Coleman Hawkins.

Rollins, inspired by the likes of Louis Jordan and Coleman Hawkins, began playing saxophone as a teenager and quickly immersed himself in the vibrant Harlem jazz scene. He was introduced to Monk while still in high school, and Monk became a mentor, offering guidance on advanced harmonic concepts and the 'geometry of musical time and space.' Their creative relationship flourished in the early 1950s, culminating in a series of influential recordings between 1953 and 1954, later compiled on the album 'Thelonious Monk and Sonny Rollins.' These sessions showcased Monk's idiosyncratic compositions and Rollins's inventive improvisational voice, marking a significant moment in modern jazz history.

Both artists went on to shape the direction of jazz for decades. Monk's compositions, such as 'Round Midnight' and 'Straight, No Chaser,' became standards, while Rollins's career soared with landmark albums like 'Saxophone Colossus.' Their collaboration not only exemplified the spirit of innovation in postwar jazz but also inspired generations of musicians to explore new harmonic and rhythmic territories.
