## Biography
Irma Thomas (born Irma Lee on February 18, 1941) is an American soul and R&B singer celebrated as the “Soul Queen of New Orleans.”[1][2][3] Born in Ponchatoula, Louisiana and raised in New Orleans, she began singing in church choirs and a gospel quartet as a child, displaying precocious vocal talent that soon led to local talent shows and an early studio recording of her school song.[2][3] As a teenager she married young and had several children, working various jobs while nurturing her musical ambitions.[1][2] Her big break came in 1958–59 when, working as a waitress at the Pimlico Club, she sat in with bandleader Tommy Ridgley; she was promptly fired from the waitressing job but Ridgley helped secure her first record deal with Ron Records.[1][2][3]

Thomas’s debut single, “You Can Have My Husband, But Please Don’t Mess With My Man,” released on the Ron label in 1959, reached No. 22 on the Billboard R&B chart in 1960 and established her as a rising regional star.[1][2][3] She soon moved to Minit Records, where songwriter‑producer Allen Toussaint crafted a series of quintessential New Orleans soul sides for her, including “It’s Raining” and “Ruler of My Heart” (later reworked by Otis Redding as “Pain in My Heart”).[1][2][3][4] When Minit was acquired by Imperial Records in 1963, Thomas scored her biggest national hit with “Wish Someone Would Care,” which reached No. 17 on the Billboard pop chart and anchored an album that blended blues, soul, and West Coast pop influences.[1][2][3][4] Despite critical acclaim and charting singles, she never achieved the sustained mainstream crossover of peers like Aretha Franklin and Etta James, yet she remained a powerful presence on the Southern “chitlin’ circuit” and college circuit throughout the 1960s, recording for labels such as Imperial, Chess, and Atlantic.[1][2][3]

In the 1970s Thomas moved to California, working day jobs in retail and auto parts while performing in clubs with other expatriate New Orleans musicians, before returning to Louisiana in the mid‑1970s, where her reputation as a live performer continued to grow.[2][3] She opened her own New Orleans nightclub, the Lion’s Den, with her husband and manager Emile Jackson in the early 1980s, turning it into a hub for local music until it was destroyed by Hurricane Katrina in 2005.[1][2] A recording comeback began in 1986 with producer Scott Billington and Rounder Records, leading to a string of well‑regarded albums, including *Live! Simply the Best* (Grammy‑nominated, 1991), the collaborative *Sing It!* with Marcia Ball and Tracy Nelson (Grammy‑nominated, 1999), and *After the Rain*, which won the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Blues Album in 2007.[1][2][3] Known for her rich, church‑inflected voice, emotional storytelling, and definitive recordings of New Orleans soul standards, Thomas has been inducted into the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame and remains a revered figure whose work has influenced generations of soul, R&B, and rock artists.[1][3]

## Fun Facts
- Thomas was fired from her waitressing job at the Pimlico Club in New Orleans for singing with Tommy Ridgley’s band instead of serving tables; that impromptu performance led directly to her first record deal and launched her career.
- She recorded one of the earliest and most influential versions of “Time Is On My Side” on her 1964 album *Wish Someone Would Care*; The Rolling Stones’ hit version, which followed soon after, so overshadowed hers that she avoided performing the song for years.
- Her song “Ruler of My Heart” was transformed by Otis Redding into “Pain in My Heart,” becoming a soul classic and illustrating how her repertoire fed directly into the 1960s Southern soul canon.
- Irma Thomas and her husband Emile Jackson ran the Lion’s Den nightclub in New Orleans, which doubled as a community gathering place and performance venue for local and touring musicians until it was destroyed by Hurricane Katrina in 2005.
