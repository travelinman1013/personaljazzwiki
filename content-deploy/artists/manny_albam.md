## Biography
Manny Albam (June 24, 1922 – October 2, 2001) was a Dominican-born American jazz arranger, composer, record producer, saxophonist, and educator. Born in Samaná, Dominican Republic, to Lithuanian parents en route to New York, Albam was raised in New York City, where he developed an early passion for jazz after hearing Bix Beiderbecke. He began playing saxophone as a teenager and soon joined Muggsy Spanier's Dixieland band, later working with the Georgie Auld band, where arranger Budd Johnson became a crucial mentor.

By the late 1940s, Albam was active as both a performer and arranger, playing in bands led by Charlie Barnet, Jerry Wald, and Sam Donahue. By 1950, he shifted focus almost entirely to arranging and composing, quickly gaining recognition for his witty, tightly constructed bebop arrangements and distinctive use of flute-led reed sections. Albam wrote for major jazz figures and ensembles, including Count Basie, Stan Kenton, and Woody Herman, and created notable works such as the Afro-Latin piece "Samana" for the Stan Kenton Innovations Orchestra. His 1958 jazz adaptation of Leonard Bernstein's 'West Side Story' earned a Grammy nomination and led to further classical studies with Tibor Serly. Over a career spanning more than five decades, Albam also wrote for film, television, and commercials, and became a respected educator, teaching at institutions such as Eastman School of Music and Manhattan School of Music, and co-founding the BMI Jazz Composers Workshop.

Albam's legacy is marked by his influential role in modern jazz arranging, his mentorship of younger composers, and his ability to bridge jazz and classical idioms. His works remain essential listening for arrangers and composers, and his impact continues through the generations of musicians he taught and inspired.
