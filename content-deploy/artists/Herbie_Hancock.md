## Biography
Herbie Hancock, born Herbert Jeffrey Hancock on April 12, 1940, in Chicago, Illinois, is a pivotal figure in modern jazz, renowned for his innovation as a pianist, composer, and bandleader. A child prodigy, Hancock performed Mozart's D Major Piano Concerto with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra at age 11 and later studied music and electrical engineering at Grinnell College, reflecting his early fascination with both classical music and technology. His jazz career began in earnest when trumpeter Donald Byrd invited him to join his band in 1961, leading to Hancock's debut solo album, 'Takin' Off,' which featured the hit 'Watermelon Man.'

Hancock's career accelerated when he joined the Miles Davis Quintet in 1963, where he helped redefine jazz rhythm sections and contributed to the development of the post-bop sound. His tenure with Davis, alongside Ron Carter and Tony Williams, was marked by groundbreaking improvisation and compositional innovation. In the 1970s, Hancock embraced electronic instruments and jazz fusion, releasing influential albums like 'Head Hunters,' which fused jazz, funk, and rock and became the first jazz album to go platinum. Hancock continued to innovate through the decades, achieving mainstream success with the electronic hit 'Rockit' in the 1980s and winning an Academy Award for his score to 'Round Midnight.'

A recipient of 14 Grammy Awards and the 2025 Polar Music Prize, Hancock's legacy is defined by his genre-blending creativity and his influence on generations of musicians across jazz, funk, hip-hop, and beyond. His compositions, including 'Cantaloupe Island,' 'Maiden Voyage,' and 'Chameleon,' are jazz standards, and his work as an educator and chairman of the Herbie Hancock Institute of Jazz has cemented his role as a mentor and advocate for the art form.
