## Biography
Mort Garson was born on July 20, 1924, in Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada, to Russian Jewish refugee parents. His family relocated to New York City during his youth, where Garson began playing piano at age 11 and pursued formal music studies at the Juilliard School. After serving in the Army during World War II, he established himself as a pianist, arranger, and composer, working with popular artists and penning several hit songs, most notably 'Our Day Will Come' for Ruby & the Romantics, which topped the Billboard charts in 1963.

In the late 1960s, Garson became a pioneering figure in electronic music, embracing the Moog synthesizer and collaborating with its inventor, Robert Moog. His most celebrated work, 'Mother Earth's Plantasia' (1976), was an experimental album created specifically for plants, blending lush, melodic synthesizer textures. Garson also produced a series of concept albums exploring themes from astrology to the occult, and composed for film and television, further showcasing his versatility. Despite limited recognition during his lifetime, Garson's innovative use of electronics and genre-blending compositions have gained renewed acclaim in the 21st century, cementing his legacy as a foundational figure in ambient and new-age music.
