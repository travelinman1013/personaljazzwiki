## Biography
Al Foster, born Aloysius Tyrone Foster on January 18, 1943, in Richmond, Virginia, grew up in Harlem, New York, where he was immersed in jazz from a young age. Inspired by performances at the Apollo Theatre, including Miles Davis' 1958 sextet with John Coltrane and Cannonball Adderley, and drummers like Max Roach and Philly Joe Jones, he began playing drums at age 13 after his amateur bassist father bought him a set. Foster's professional debut came in 1964 with Blue Mitchell's Quintet at Minton’s Playhouse, recording the Blue Note classic *The Thing To Do* at Rudy Van Gelder’s studio alongside Junior Cook, Chick Corea, and Gene Taylor[1][2][3][5][6].

Foster quickly established himself in New York's jazz scene, working with artists like Larry Willis, Hugh Masekela, McCoy Tyner, and Joe Henderson while supporting his four daughters as a single parent. His breakthrough arrived in 1972 when Miles Davis, impressed by Foster's groove at the Cellar Club, recruited him after Jack DeJohnette's departure, launching a 13-year tenure that defined Davis' electric fusion era on albums like *Get Up With It* (1974), *Agharta* (1975), *Dark Magus* (1977), and *We Want Miles* (1981)[1][2][4]. Known for his precise, intuitive style—blending bebop swing, hard bop, funk, and fusion—Foster excelled in telepathic interplay, providing rhythmic foundations that allowed soloists to shine[1][2][4][5][6]. He also led sessions like *Mixed Roots* (1978) and *Love, Peace and Jazz* (2005, live at Village Vanguard)[2].

Foster's legacy as a versatile master drummer spanned over five decades, earning him the 1973 DownBeat Critics Poll Drummer of the Year and a 1986 Grammy for *We Want Miles!. He toured with Herbie Hancock, Stan Getz, Bobby Hutcherson, and others, composing piano pieces recorded by Hank Jones and maintaining a presence at clubs like Smoke until his death on May 28, 2025, at age 82 in New York City[2][5][6][7].
