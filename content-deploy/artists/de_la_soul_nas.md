## Biography
The query 'De La Soul/ Nas' refers to two distinct pioneering hip-hop acts: De La Soul, an American hip-hop trio formed in 1988 in Amityville, Long Island, New York, by high school friends Posdnuos (Kelvin Mercer), Trugoy the Dove (David Jude Jolicoeur, died 2023), and Maseo (Vincent Mason), and Nas (Nasir bin Olu Dara Jones), an American rapper born September 14, 1973, in Brooklyn, New York, who grew up in Queensbridge Houses, Queens. De La Soul revolutionized hip-hop with their 1989 debut album 3 Feet High and Rising, introducing eclectic sampling, quirky lyrics, and a laid-back vibe that contrasted macho gangsta rap, pioneering jazz rap and alternative hip-hop subgenres.[3][5][7] Nas, son of jazz trumpeter Olu Dara, started as 'Nasty Nas' in 1989, debuting on Main Source's 'Live at the Barbeque' in 1991, and exploded with his 1994 classic Illmatic, blending gritty street narratives with intricate, jazz-infused lyricism rooted in East Coast hip-hop.[1][2]

De La Soul's career evolved through innovative albums like De La Soul Is Dead (1991), challenging their 'hippie' image, while facing sampling disputes that delayed releases until Buhloone Mindstate (1993) and beyond, solidifying their legacy in expanding rap's boundaries.[5][7] Nas developed from Illmatic's raw Queensbridge tales through supergroup The Firm (1997), label battles with Jay-Z, and 17 studio albums, many certified gold or platinum, while venturing into entrepreneurship with Mass Appeal Records.[1] Both acts share jazz rap and East Coast roots, with Nas' style echoing De La Soul's genre fusion via his father's influence and early jazz-rap pioneers.[2][8]

Their legacies endure: De La Soul as architects of alternative hip-hop, influencing eclectic rap; Nas as one of the greatest rappers, with cultural impact via awards, collaborations like with Lin-Manuel Miranda, and business ventures.[1][5]
