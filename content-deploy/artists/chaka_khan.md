## Biography
Chaka Khan, born Yvette Marie Stevens on March 23, 1953, in Chicago, Illinois, is celebrated as the 'Queen of Funk' for her powerful vocals and genre-defining contributions to soul, funk, and R&B. Raised in a musical family, Khan showed early promise, forming her first group, The Crystalettes, with her sister at age 11. Her teenage years were marked by activism, including involvement with the Black Panther Party, before she fully committed to music in the early 1970s.

Khan's career took off as the dynamic lead singer of Rufus, a funk band that achieved major success with hits like 'Tell Me Something Good' (written by Stevie Wonder) and 'Sweet Thing.' Her commanding stage presence and vocal range quickly made her a standout, leading to a solo debut in 1978 with the hit 'I'm Every Woman.' Over the next decades, Khan released a string of acclaimed albums, including 'I Feel for You,' which brought hip-hop elements into mainstream R&B, and collaborated with a wide array of artists across genres. Her enduring influence is reflected in ten Grammy Awards and her 2023 induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

Khan's musical style blends funk, soul, jazz, and pop, characterized by her expressive phrasing and technical virtuosity. She has left a lasting legacy, inspiring generations of vocalists and musicians, and remains active in music, theater, and philanthropy, continuing to shape the sound and spirit of contemporary popular music.
