## Biography
The Poets of Rhythm are a German funk group from Munich widely credited as key architects of the modern deep funk and soul revival. Formed in the mid‑1980s/early 1990s by schoolmates Jan Weissenfeldt (a.k.a. J.J. Whitefield) and singer Boris Geiger (a.k.a. Bo Baral), the band grew out of their obsession with late‑1960s and early‑1970s independent funk 45s and the sounds of James Brown, Funkadelic, Parliament, and The Meters.[2][5][6] They began by digging rare groove records and soon founded their own 7" label, Hotpie & Candy Records, to release their first recordings, including the self‑produced 1992 single “Funky Train” b/w “Hotpie’s Popcorn.”[2][5] Their debut album, “Practice What You Preach” (1993), recorded in a raw, analog style that closely emulated vintage U.S. funk, became a cult classic on the rare groove scene and helped ignite a small renaissance of old‑school funk at a time when such music had largely vanished from mainstream culture.[2]

Throughout the 1990s the group expanded into a larger ensemble and recorded under numerous aliases (such as Soul-Saints Orchestra, Organized Raw Funk, and others), pursuing a gritty, live‑in‑the‑room sound that rejected polished contemporary production and the then‑fashionable “acid jazz” aesthetic.[1][2] Initially signed to German label Soulciety in the early 1990s, they later connected with New York’s Desco Records, and eventually reached a broader international audience through their association with DJ Shadow’s Quannum Projects, which released their album “Discern/Define” in 2001.[1][2] Their meticulous use of older recording techniques and equipment, combined with deeply researched rhythmic and harmonic vocabularies from classic funk 45s, earned them a reputation among collectors, DJs, and musicians as one of the most convincing and creative modern funk bands.[1][2]

The Poets of Rhythm’s legacy lies in their role as foundational figures of the global funk and soul revival that took shape in the 1990s and 2000s. Their work prefigured and directly connected to projects like the Whitefield Brothers and Karl Hector & The Malcouns, as members pursued related explorations of psychedelic funk, Afro‑influenced grooves, and analog production.[1][4] By proving that a band from Munich could convincingly channel the spirit, texture, and energy of obscure American funk, they helped reshape perceptions of what funk could be and where it could come from, inspiring a wave of contemporary deep funk bands, labels, and collectors worldwide.[1][2][6]

## Fun Facts
- The Poets of Rhythm initially released “Funky Train” / “Hotpie’s Popcorn” on their own tiny 7" label, Hotpie & Candy Records, pressing and producing it themselves with no major‑label backing.[2][5]
- To reinforce the mystique and vintage feel of their records, they frequently changed band names for different 45s, issuing music under aliases like Bo Baral’s Excursionists, Bus People Express, Soul-Saints Orchestra, Organized Raw Funk, The Polyversal Souls, and many more.[1][5]
- Their early recordings were so authentically raw and analog that many listeners and record collectors initially assumed they were obscure 1970s American funk originals rather than contemporary tracks from Munich, Germany.[1][2][3]
- A failed early studio session nearly delayed their debut: they were about to cut a 45 when the bass player quit on the night of the session, forcing them to regroup and ultimately record the lineup that produced “Funky Train.”[5]

## Musical Connections

### Mentors/Influences
- [[james_brown_and_the_j.b.s|James Brown and The J.B.'s]] - Core stylistic and rhythmic influence; the band modeled their groove, horn arrangements, and raw live feel on late‑1960s/early‑1970s James Brown productions. (General influence on early singles like “Funky Train” and album “Practice What You Preach.”) [Influence discovered mid‑1980s; foundational through 1990s and beyond.[1][2][6]]
- [[funkadelic__parliament_george_clinton_bootsy_collins|Funkadelic / Parliament (George Clinton, Bootsy Collins)]] - Inspired their psychedelic edge and concept of multiple aliases and projects under one creative umbrella, similar to the P‑Funk universe. (Influence heard in their broader catalog and side projects like Whitefield Brothers; concept of multiple band names echoed P‑Funk’s sprawling family.[1][5][6]) [Discovered as teens in the mid‑1980s; continued inspiration throughout career.[5][6]]
- [[the_meters|The Meters]] - Major influence on their New Orleans‑inflected, syncopated funk and emphasis on tight, earthy grooves. (Overall approach on “Practice What You Preach” and early 7" releases; cited as a key inspiration by the group’s founders.[1][6]) [Late 1980s discovery onward, shaping early 1990s recordings.[1][6]]

### Key Collaborators
- [[jan_weissenfeldt_j.j._whitefield|Jan Weissenfeldt (J.J. Whitefield)]] - Founding guitarist, producer, and principal creative force; co‑founded the band and Hotpie & Candy Records. (“Funky Train” single, “Practice What You Preach,” “Discern/Define,” and numerous alias projects (e.g., Whitefield Brothers, Karl Hector‑related work).) [Mid‑1980s founding through 1990s–2000s.[2][4][5][6]]
- [[boris_geiger_bo_baral|Boris Geiger (Bo Baral)]] - Founding singer/leader; central in shaping the band’s identity and multiple alias concept. (Lead vocals and creative direction on early Poets of Rhythm releases including “Funky Train” and “Practice What You Preach.”) [Mid‑1980s founding through at least the 1990s.[1][5][6]]
- [[jan_krause|Jan Krause]] - Core band member (often cited as drummer) in their classic lineup, contributing to their tight, live rhythmic sound. (Member during key 1990s recordings including “Practice What You Preach.”) [Active member starting early 1990s.[7]]
- [[max_weissenfeldt|Max Weissenfeldt]] - Founding member associated with Poets of Rhythm and later central to side‑project the Whitefield Brothers with Jan. (Early Poets of Rhythm work; Whitefield Brothers recordings, which extended the Poets’ analog funk aesthetic.) [Early 1990s with Poets of Rhythm; 1990s–2000s with Whitefield Brothers.[3][4]]
- [[lyrics_born_tom_shimura|Lyrics Born (Tom Shimura)]] - Quannum Projects MC and producer who discovered their 7" in New Orleans, helped bring them to a wider hip‑hop and international audience, and recorded with them. (Collaboration during sessions for his solo debut “Later That Day”; connection led into the Poets’ album “Discern/Define” on Quannum Projects.) [Discovery in early 1990s; studio collaboration and album work around 1998–2001.[2][3]]

### Artists Influenced
- [[whitefield_brothers|Whitefield Brothers]] - Side‑project/alter‑ego of Poets of Rhythm founders Jan and Max Whitefield that directly extends the Poets’ analog deep‑funk and psychedelic groove concepts. (Self‑titled debut album recorded after trips from Munich to New York, continuing the raw funk aesthetic pioneered with Poets of Rhythm.[4]) [Late 1990s–2000s.[4]]
- [[karl_hector_and_related_funkpsych_projects|Karl Hector & related funk/psych projects]] - Alias/projects springing from the same core musicians, applying Poets of Rhythm’s techniques to more global and psychedelic territories. (Releases under names like Karl Hector & The Funk-Pilots, which build on the deep‑funk template refined in Poets of Rhythm.[1]) [Late 1990s onward.[1]]
- [[contemporary_deep_funk_and_soul_revival_bands_and_djs|Contemporary deep funk and soul revival bands and DJs]] - Widely cited by collectors and commentators as foundational to the 1990s/2000s funk revival; their authentic sound and limited‑press 45s became touchstones for modern funk bands and crate‑digging DJs. (Influence felt in the broader resurgence of analog funk aesthetics and small‑label 7" culture that followed their early 1990s releases and “Discern/Define.”) [Mid‑1990s through 2000s and beyond.[1][2][3][6]]
