## Biography
Paul Thorn is an American singer-songwriter known for his unique blend of Americana, roots rock, alt-country, and Southern rock. Born in Kenosha, Wisconsin in 1964, Thorn was raised in Tupelo, Mississippi, the same town as Elvis Presley. His upbringing was deeply shaped by his father, a Pentecostal preacher, and much of his childhood was spent singing in church and attending revivals, including at African American congregations where he absorbed diverse musical influences. Thorn learned to play guitar, organ, and piano early on, and his exposure to gospel and Appalachian music left a lasting imprint on his style.

Before launching his music career, Thorn pursued several other vocations, including working in a furniture factory, skydiving, and notably, professional boxing, where he amassed a respectable record and even fought world champion Roberto Durán. Thorn began performing at local clubs and writing songs with his friend Billy Maddox, eventually catching the attention of music executive Miles Copeland. This led to a record deal with A&M Records and the opportunity to open for Sting on tour, which was his first concert experience. Since his 1997 debut album 'Hammer & Nail,' Thorn has released over ten albums, earning acclaim for his storytelling, humor, and heartfelt songwriting. His music, which draws from blues, country, gospel, and rock, often explores themes of faith, resilience, and the human condition.

Thorn's legacy is marked by his authenticity and his ability to connect with audiences across genres. He continues to tour and record, maintaining a devoted fan base and a reputation as a compelling live performer. In addition to music, Thorn is also an accomplished painter, with his artwork featured on several album covers, further showcasing his multifaceted creativity.
