## Biography
Damh the Bard, born Dave Smith, is a British musician and Druid based in Brighton who expresses his spirituality through music, storytelling, and poetry.[1] From an early age, he was obsessed with music, regularly singing to John Denver and Ralph McTell on his rocking horse.[3] He received his first guitar at age 8 and was taught Irish folk music by his teacher, Tim O'Leary, a multi-instrumentalist Irishman.[3] Playing his first live concerts at age 11 in pubs on the Isle of Wight, he progressed through several rock bands during his teens, including Targa, which achieved a headlining concert at London's prestigious Marquee Club.[1][3]

During the 1990s, Damh discovered Paganism and underwent formal training as a Bard, poet, and storyteller in the Order of Bards, Ovates and Druids.[1][3] This spiritual journey led him to find his artistic expression in folk music, forming the 'Mystic Folk' band Spiral Castle, which performed at major festivals including the Pagan Federation International Conference at Fairfield Halls in Croydon.[1][3] He released his debut solo album, Herne's Apprentice, in 2002, followed by The Hills They Are Hollow (2003), Spirit of Albion (2006), and The Cauldron Born (2008).[1] His subsequent releases included Tales from the Crow Man (2009), As Nature Intended (2010), Antlered Crown and Standing Stone (2012), and Sabbat (2014).[1]

After Sabbat, Damh embarked on an ambitious multi-year project to create the Four Branches of the Mabinogion in audio format, combining song, story, and film-type scoring.[1][3] Y Mabinogi – The First Branch was released in 2017, The Second Branch in 2018, and The Third Branch in 2020.[1][3] He released Raise the Flag of Green in 2024 before returning to work on The Fourth Branch.[3] Drawing on the Bardic traditions and ancient myths and legends of the British Isles—from King Arthur to Taliesin, from the Welsh Mabinogion to old British folk customs—Damh has performed extensively on the spiritual festival circuit across the UK, USA, Australia, and Europe, entertaining audiences ranging from intimate gatherings of 50 to venues with 1500+ attendees.[3][4]

## Fun Facts
- Damh's bardic name means 'stag' in Gaelic, and he has had a connection to the deer for decades, likely inspired by seeing the figure of Herne in the 1970s Robin of Sherwood television series.[5]
- He was initiated into a Ceremonial Magic group at age 18 before discovering Paganism and Druidry.[7]
- In August 2007, Damh was featured as one of the folk singer/songwriters on the John Barleycorn Reborn compilation, which highlighted modern folk artists breaking new ground by working deeper with UK mythology and folklore.[3]
- Damh transitioned from playing in heavy metal and rock bands during his teens to finding his musical home in acoustic folk music, describing this as a significant artistic evolution.[5]
