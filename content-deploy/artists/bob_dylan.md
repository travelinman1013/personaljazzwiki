## Biography
Bob Dylan, born Robert Allen Zimmerman on May 24, 1941, in Duluth, Minnesota, spent most of his childhood in Hibbing, a mining town in the state’s north. He taught himself piano and guitar as a teenager and played in several bands before briefly attending the University of Minnesota in 1959. Drawn by the burgeoning folk scene and inspired by his musical hero Woody Guthrie, Dylan moved to New York City in 1961, quickly becoming a fixture in Greenwich Village’s coffeehouses and clubs.

Dylan’s early work was rooted in traditional folk and blues, but he soon distinguished himself with original songs that combined poetic lyrics and social commentary. Signed by Columbia Records’ John Hammond, Dylan released his self-titled debut in 1962, followed by 'The Freewheelin’ Bob Dylan' (1963), which included anthems like 'Blowin’ in the Wind' and 'A Hard Rain’s a-Gonna Fall.' These songs became rallying cries for the civil rights and antiwar movements. In the mid-1960s, Dylan famously 'went electric,' fusing folk with rock on albums such as 'Bringing It All Back Home' and 'Highway 61 Revisited,' challenging musical boundaries and influencing generations of artists.

Over a career spanning more than six decades, Dylan has continually reinvented his sound, exploring folk, rock, country, gospel, and beyond. He has sold over 100 million records worldwide, won numerous awards—including the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2016 for his songwriting—and is widely regarded as one of the most influential figures in popular music and culture.
