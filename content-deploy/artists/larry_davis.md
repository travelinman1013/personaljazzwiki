## Biography
Larry Davis was an American electric Texas blues and soul blues musician born on December 4, 1936, in Kansas City, Missouri, and died on April 19, 1994, in Los Angeles, California. He emerged as a significant figure in the Texas blues scene during the 1950s, debuting on vinyl in 1958 with Duke Records. Davis became best known for co-composing and recording "Texas Flood," a seminal blues composition that would later become iconic through Stevie Ray Vaughan's rendition, though Davis's original version remains a superlative example of electric Texas blues guitar work.

Throughout his career spanning from the 1950s through the 1990s, Davis maintained a distinctive style rooted in electric Texas blues with soul blues influences. His work demonstrated masterful guitar playing and authentic blues vocals that captured the essence of the regional Texas blues tradition. While Davis never achieved the mainstream commercial success of some of his contemporaries, his contributions to blues music remained influential within the genre, particularly through his songwriting and his role in establishing the "Texas Flood" composition as a blues standard.
