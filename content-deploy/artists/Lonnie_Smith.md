## Biography
Dr. Lonnie Smith (July 3, 1942 – September 28, 2021) was an American jazz Hammond B-3 organist celebrated for his genre-blending style and inventive improvisation. Born in Lackawanna, New York, Smith was immersed in music from an early age, performing gospel, jazz, and blues with his family’s vocal group on local radio. His mother was a pivotal influence, introducing him to a wide array of musical traditions. As a teenager, Smith sang in vocal groups and played trumpet before discovering the Hammond organ, an instrument that would become his lifelong passion. Encouraged by local music store owner Art Kubera, Smith taught himself the organ by listening to records by Wild Bill Davis, Bill Doggett, and Jimmy Smith, as well as drawing inspiration from church music.

Smith’s career took off in the early 1960s when he joined guitarist George Benson’s quartet, relocating to New York City and quickly establishing a reputation in Harlem’s jazz scene. He soon recorded with saxophonist Lou Donaldson, contributing to the iconic Blue Note album 'Alligator Boogaloo.' Smith’s own debut as a leader, 'Finger Lickin’ Good,' was released in 1966, followed by a string of influential Blue Note albums such as 'Think!,' 'Turning Point,' and 'Move Your Hand.' Over a career spanning more than five decades, Smith recorded over seventy albums, collaborating with a who’s who of jazz, blues, and R&B artists. Renowned for his soulful, funky approach and his ability to fuse jazz with funk, soul, and even elements of hip-hop, Smith is regarded as a pioneer of the acid jazz and soul jazz movements.

Smith’s legacy is marked by his innovative spirit, technical mastery, and deep influence on generations of musicians. He was named Jazz Journalists Association’s Organist of the Year nine times and was inducted into the Buffalo Music Hall of Fame. His music has been widely sampled by hip-hop artists, and he remained an active performer and recording artist until his passing in 2021, leaving an indelible mark on the evolution of jazz organ.
