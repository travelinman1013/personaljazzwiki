## Biography
The Specials, also known as the Special AKA, were an English 2 Tone ska revival band formed in 1977 in Coventry, England. Founded by keyboardist Jerry Dammers alongside guitarist Lynval Golding and bassist Horace Panter, the band evolved from their initial incarnation as the Coventry Automatics. The classic lineup solidified in 1978 with the addition of lead vocalist Terry Hall, guitarist Roddy Radiation (Roddy Byers), drummer John Bradbury, vocalist Neville Staple, and horn players Dick Cuthell and Rico Rodriguez. The Specials emerged during a period of significant social and political tension in Britain, and their music—blending Jamaican ska with English punk energy—became a vehicle for addressing racial tensions, unemployment, and social inequality. Their ascent was meteoric: between 1979 and 1981, they achieved seven consecutive UK Top 10 singles, including two number ones, and established their own independent record label, 2 Tone Records, which became synonymous with the ska revival movement and was identified by its distinctive black-and-white color scheme.

The band's commercial and cultural peak came with their debut album in 1979, produced by Elvis Costello, and their follow-up 'More Specials,' which expanded their sound to include lounge music and other influences. Their most iconic single, 'Ghost Town,' recorded in April 1981 at a home studio in Leamington Spa, spent three weeks at number one in July 1981 and became a prophetic portrait of Britain's urban crisis. Remarkably, the band disbanded in the dressing room immediately after their Top of the Pops performance on July 9, 1981, following 'Ghost Town's' chart success. After the split, main vocalists Terry Hall and Neville Staple, along with guitarist Lynval Golding, departed to form Fun Boy Three, while Jerry Dammers continued as the Special AKA with a substantially revised lineup, releasing the politically charged hit 'Free Nelson Mandela' in 1984 before Dammers dissolved the band to pursue political activism.

The Specials' legacy proved enduring and influential. The band reunited for tours in 1994-2001 and again from 2008 onwards, with surviving original members Terry Hall, Lynval Golding, and Horace Panter leading subsequent iterations. Their impact on popular music was profound, inspiring the wave of American ska-punk bands that emerged in the mid-1990s, including Rancid and No Doubt, who cited The Specials' 1980 Saturday Night Live performance of 'Gangsters' as a legendary, inspirational moment. The band's fusion of infectious danceable rhythms with urgent political messaging established a template for socially conscious popular music, and their role in the 2 Tone movement helped address racial divisions through music and fashion during a deeply polarized era in British society.

## Fun Facts
- The Specials' most iconic single 'Ghost Town' was recorded in just ten days in April 1981 at an 8-track home studio in Leamington Spa, and the band famously disbanded in the dressing room immediately after their Top of the Pops performance on July 9, 1981, right after the song reached number one.
- The band's 1980 Saturday Night Live performance of 'Gangsters' became legendary among American musicians and is described as 'The Beatles on Ed Sullivan in Sta-prest and a pork pie'—the performance was so influential that fuzzy, nth-generation video copies were passed among collectors and became inspirational for future ska-punk bands.
- Jerry Dammers established 2 Tone Records as an independent label with a distinctive black-and-white color scheme that became synonymous with the entire ska revival movement; the band members were motivated to start their own label after experiencing repeated disappointments with managers and record companies.
- The Specials hosted a 70th birthday celebration concert for Nelson Mandela in 1988, reflecting the band's deep commitment to political activism and social justice, which culminated in their 1984 hit single 'Free Nelson Mandela' released under the Special AKA name.
