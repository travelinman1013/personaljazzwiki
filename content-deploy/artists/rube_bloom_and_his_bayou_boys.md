## Biography
Rube Bloom and His Bayou Boys was a short-lived but influential jazz ensemble led by Reuben Bloom, a prolific American songwriter, pianist, arranger, and bandleader born in New York City on April 24, 1902. Bloom began his career in the 1920s, composing novelty piano solos and collaborating with prominent jazz musicians of the era. His musical style blended ragtime, swing, and early jazz, characterized by inventive arrangements and a playful approach to rhythm and melody[1].

The Bayou Boys, formed in 1930, was an all-star studio group assembled by Bloom during the early years of the Great Depression. The lineup featured some of the most celebrated jazz musicians of the time, including Benny Goodman, Adrian Rollini, Tommy Dorsey, and Mannie Klein. Although the group only recorded three records, their work is considered among the finest studio jazz recordings of the period, showcasing tight ensemble playing and sophisticated swing arrangements[1].

Bloom's legacy extends beyond his work with the Bayou Boys; he collaborated with legendary lyricists such as Johnny Mercer and Ted Koehler, and his compositions have been recorded by artists like Ella Fitzgerald. His influence on American popular music is reflected in both his songwriting and his innovative approach to jazz piano, which helped bridge the gap between ragtime and swing[1].
