## Biography
The South Frisco Jazz Band is a renowned traditional jazz ensemble founded in 1956 by banjoist Vince Saunders in Orange County, California. The band's name pays homage to the classic San Francisco jazz of Lu Watters and Turk Murphy, with a particular emphasis on the two-cornet front line popularized by King Oliver's Creole Jazz Band and Watters' Yerba Buena Jazz Band. Throughout the 1960s, the band became a staple of the Southern California jazz scene, performing regularly at venues such as the Honeybucket in Costa Mesa and the Pizza Palace in Huntington Beach, where they held a residency for over five years[2][5].

The South Frisco Jazz Band specialized in the authentic jazz styles of the 1920s and 1930s, focusing on the repertoire of King Oliver, Lu Watters, Jelly Roll Morton, Louis Armstrong, Clarence Williams, and Turk Murphy. Their dedication to ensemble sound and pre-1930 jazz performance made them stand out among traditional jazz bands. Over the decades, the band built a worldwide following, recording more than a dozen albums and appearing at major jazz festivals across the United States and internationally, including tours in Europe, Japan, and the Caribbean[1][2].

Known for their dynamic and soulful performances, the South Frisco Jazz Band maintained high standards of authenticity and musicianship. The group often convened for festival appearances, overseas tours, and recording sessions, with members residing across the US. Their legacy lies in their commitment to preserving and revitalizing classic jazz traditions, influencing generations of musicians and enthusiasts dedicated to the genre[1][2][3].
