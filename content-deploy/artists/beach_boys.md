## Biography
The Beach Boys are an American rock band formed in Hawthorne, California, in 1961 by brothers Brian, Dennis, and Carl Wilson, their cousin Mike Love, and friend Al Jardine. Starting as a garage band managed by the Wilsons' father Murry, they initially drew inspiration from surfing culture—prompted by Dennis Wilson's actual surfing experiences—releasing their debut single 'Surfin'' in 1961 under the renamed moniker after being the Pendletones. Signing with Capitol Records in 1962, they achieved national success with hits like 'Surfin' Safari' and 'Surfin' U.S.A.', embodying the 'California Sound' of youth, cars, romance, and beach life through intricate vocal harmonies influenced by 1950s rock and roll, pop vocal groups, and R&B[1][2][3][5].

Brian Wilson emerged as the creative force, producing and composing most songs while innovating with classical, jazz elements, and pioneering studio techniques. By 1965, with Bruce Johnston joining, they shifted from surf themes to introspective lyrics and ambitious productions, peaking with the 1966 album *Pet Sounds* and single 'Good Vibrations', widely regarded as groundbreaking in pop music history for their layered sounds and experimentation. Despite commercial success during the British Invasion and over 100 million records sold, the band faced internal conflicts, Brian's mental health struggles including substance abuse and breakdowns, and tragedies like Dennis's 1983 drowning and Carl's death[2][3][4][5].

Inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1988, the Beach Boys' legacy endures as one of rock's most influential acts, shaping psychedelic rock, youth culture, and studio production standards, with enduring hits like 'Kokomo' and continued touring despite lineup changes[2][3][5].

## Fun Facts
- The band started as 'The Pendletones' after wearing Pendleton shirts but was renamed 'The Beach Boys' by their label without permission when unpacking their first singles[1][3].

- Brian Wilson composed nearly all early songs, often collaborating with Mike Love on lyrics, and pioneered techniques like multi-tracking that shaped modern production[3][5].
- They were Capitol Records' first rock act, debuting with 'Surfin' Safari' in 1962 after being rejected by other labels[3].
