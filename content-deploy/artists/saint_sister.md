## Biography
Saint Sister is an acclaimed electro-folk duo formed in Dublin in 2014 by Morgan MacIntyre (from Belfast) and Gemma Doherty (from Derry), both hailing from Northern Ireland. The pair met while studying at Trinity College Dublin, initially crossing paths through the college orchestra and mutual friends. Their collaboration began after graduation, when MacIntyre, a songwriter with a passion for lyrics, and Doherty, a multi-instrumentalist and composer, decided to blend their musical talents, resulting in a unique partnership built on close-knit harmonies and a shared artistic vision[2][4][6].

Saint Sister quickly gained recognition for their distinctive sound, which fuses Celtic harp, synthesizer, and analog drum machines with ethereal vocal harmonies. Their debut EP, 'Madrid,' recorded with Alex Ryan of Hozier's band, was streamed over two million times and led to widespread radio play and touring opportunities across Europe. Their first full-length album, 'Shape of Silence' (2018), received critical acclaim and was nominated for both the Choice Music Prize and the Northern Irish Music Prize. The duo has performed at major festivals such as Glastonbury, SXSW, and Electric Picnic, and supported renowned artists including The National, Lisa Hannigan, Hozier, and Keane[1][3][4].

Saint Sister's music is often described as modern yet timeless, drawing on influences from Irish folk, classical composition, and contemporary electronic production. Their sophomore album, 'Where I Should End' (2021), marked a shift in their sound, with self-produced, resonant soundscapes and evocative storytelling. The duo's legacy lies in their innovative approach to Irish folk traditions, their commitment to self-production, and their ability to craft emotionally rich, atmospheric music that resonates with audiences worldwide[4][8].
