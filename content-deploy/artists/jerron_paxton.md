## Biography
Jerron "Blind Boy" Paxton, born January 26, 1989 in Los Angeles, California, is a celebrated American multi-instrumentalist, vocalist, and tradition bearer of early blues, jazz, and Black folk music. Raised in the Watts district, Paxton's Southern roots—his grandparents migrated from Louisiana to California in 1956—deeply influenced his musical upbringing. He was immersed in the sounds of old Cajun and country blues sung by his grandmother and the blues played on local radio, sparking a passion for music that led him to the fiddle at age twelve and the banjo at fourteen. Paxton is legally blind, having lost most of his sight as a teenager, but this has not hindered his artistic development[1][4][8].

Paxton moved to upstate New York in 2007 to attend Marist College and soon became a fixture in Brooklyn's roots music scene. He is renowned for his mastery of guitar, banjo, piano, violin, harmonica, Cajun accordion, and more, drawing from the blues idiom of the 1920s and '30s and the traditions of artists like Fats Waller, Blind Lemon Jefferson, Bessie Smith, and Lonnie Johnson[1][2][3]. His performances at major festivals, including his role as artistic director of the Port Townsend Acoustic Blues Workshop and Festival, and his appearances in documentaries such as "The American Epic Sessions," have cemented his reputation as a leading interpreter of Black traditional music[1][3][7].

Paxton's artistry is characterized by a refusal to compartmentalize genres, blending blues, jazz, ragtime, country blues, Cajun, and old-time music into what he calls "Black folk music." He is often compared to contemporary tradition bearers like Taj Mahal, Keb' Mo', and Corey Harris, and is one of the few African-American banjo players touring today. His legacy lies in his ability to channel the spirit and sound of early American music, inspiring new generations to appreciate and learn from the rich tapestry of Black musical heritage[1][3][4].
