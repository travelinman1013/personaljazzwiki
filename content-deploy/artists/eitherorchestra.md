## Biography
Either/Orchestra is a pioneering jazz ensemble founded in 1985 by saxophonist and composer Russ Gershon in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Conceived initially as a rehearsal band to explore Gershon’s compositions, the group quickly developed a unique identity, blending the structure and lushness of a big band with the agility and improvisational spirit of a small combo. Their early performances at local venues like the Cambridge Public Library and Boston’s Scullers Jazz Club set the stage for a career marked by adventurous touring and a commitment to both jazz tradition and innovation.

The band’s sound draws inspiration from jazz legends such as Duke Ellington, Gil Evans, Charles Mingus, and Sun Ra, but also incorporates elements from rock, Latin, and avant-garde music, reflecting Gershon’s background in Boston’s rock scene. Either/Orchestra has been notable for its willingness to tour like indie rock bands, playing non-traditional jazz venues across North America and fostering a sense of camaraderie among its members. In the mid-1990s, the group began a deep exploration of Ethiopian music, collaborating with Ethiojazz pioneers like Mulatu Astatke and Getachew Mekurya, and performing with renowned vocalists Mahmoud Ahmed and Alemayehu Eshete. This cross-cultural work has become a defining aspect of their legacy, earning them international acclaim and a Grammy nomination for their album 'Calculus of Pleasure.'

Over nearly four decades, Either/Orchestra has served as a launching pad for numerous prominent jazz musicians, with almost 50 members passing through its ranks. The ensemble’s innovative approach, genre-blending repertoire, and global collaborations have secured its place as one of the most influential and enduring modern jazz big bands.
