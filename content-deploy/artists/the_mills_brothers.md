## Biography
The Mills Brothers were an iconic African-American vocal quartet born in Piqua, Ohio, consisting of four brothers: John Mills Jr. (guitarist and bassist), Herbert (tenor), Harry (baritone), and Donald (lead tenor). Born into a musical family—their father John H. Mills owned a barbershop and was an accomplished light-opera singer—the brothers began performing in their father's barbershop, where they developed their signature barbershop harmony sound. They made their public debut in 1925 at May's Opera House in Piqua, opening for a Rin Tin Tin film and earning $4 a night plus tips. A pivotal moment came during an amateur contest when Harry lost his kazoo and improvised trumpet sounds by cupping his hands over his mouth; this accidental discovery led all the brothers to develop their revolutionary vocal instrumental imitations, which became their defining artistic trademark and set them apart from other vocal groups of the era.

The Mills Brothers' rise to national prominence accelerated rapidly in the late 1920s and early 1930s. After performing on Cincinnati radio station WLW, they caught the attention of Duke Ellington, who recommended them to Brunswick Records and helped facilitate their signing. In September 1930, CBS Radio executive William S. Paley heard their audition and immediately signed them to a three-year contract, making them the first African-Americans to host a network radio show and the first African-American vocal group to gain widespread popularity among white audiences. Their debut recording, "Tiger Rag," became a nationwide best-seller and gold-certified hit, selling over one million copies. The group achieved their greatest commercial success with "Paper Doll" in 1943, which sold six million copies and became their first and only No. 1 hit on the Billboard singles chart. Throughout their career, which spanned over 50 years from the Jazz Age through the Rock and Roll era, they sold more than 50 million records and became known for their close harmonies, sophisticated arrangements, and ability to seamlessly blend jazz, pop, and swing styles.

The Mills Brothers' legacy was marked by both tragedy and resilience. When John Mills Jr. died suddenly in 1936 while performing in England, their father John Sr. stepped in to replace him as bassist and tuba vocalist, allowing the group to continue without loss of popularity. They became the first African-Americans to perform before British royalty in 1934, appearing before King George V and Queen Mary at the Regal Theatre. The group was inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 1998, cementing their status as pioneers in American music history. After their father's retirement in 1957, the three surviving brothers—Herbert, Harry, and Donald—continued performing until Harry's death in 1982, followed by Herbert's death in 1989. Donald Mills continued performing with his son John throughout the 1990s, ensuring the Mills Brothers' legacy remained alive for new generations of music lovers.
