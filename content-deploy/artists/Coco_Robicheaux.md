## Biography
Coco Robicheaux, born Curtis John Arceneaux on October 25, 1947, in Merced, California, was a celebrated American blues musician and artist whose roots trace back to Ascension Parish, Louisiana. His father was of Acadian (Cajun) descent, and his mother brought a diverse heritage including English, Norwegian, Scottish, German, Dutch, Welsh, and Mohawk ancestry. Robicheaux spent part of his youth in France, where his Air Force father was stationed, and some of his childhood in the French countryside, experiences that contributed to his eclectic worldview and musical style[1][2][3].

Robicheaux began fronting his own band at age 13 and was performing on Bourbon Street by 15. He secured his first record contract at 18, but his recording career did not take off until the mid-1990s, when he released the well-received album 'Spiritland.' He was deeply influenced by Louisiana folklore, taking his stage name from a local legend about a child abducted by a werewolf, and his music blended blues, voodoo mysticism, and New Orleans rhythms. His albums, including 'Louisiana Medicine Man,' 'Hoodoo Party,' 'Yeah, U Rite!,' 'Like I Said, Yeah, U Rite!,' and 'Revelator,' showcased his unique style and earned him accolades such as Offbeat Magazine’s Best Blues Album by a Louisiana Artist[1][3].

Robicheaux was a fixture of the New Orleans music scene, performing at venues across the city and at festivals worldwide, including eight consecutive years at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival and annual appearances at the French Quarter Festival. He also appeared in television shows such as HBO’s 'Treme' and the USA Network’s 'The Big Easy.' Robicheaux died on November 25, 2011, at age 64, in his favorite bar, the Apple Barrel on Frenchmen Street. His legacy endures through musical tributes, second-line parades, and continued recognition in New Orleans culture[1][2][3].
