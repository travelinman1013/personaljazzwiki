## Biography
Santi White, professionally known as Santigold, was born on September 25, 1976, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Before establishing herself as a solo artist, she worked as an A&R representative for Epic Records, where she identified and developed new talent. She then transitioned to co-writing and executive producing Res's debut album "How I Do" before becoming the lead singer of the Philadelphia-based punk rock band Stiffed, which released the EP "Sex Sells" (2003) and the album "Burned Again" (2005), both produced by Bad Brains bassist Darryl Jenifer. While performing with Stiffed, White was offered a solo contract by Lizard King Records, marking the beginning of her solo career.[1][2][3]

Under the stage name Santogold, White released her self-titled debut album in April 2008, which received widespread critical acclaim for its innovative cross-genre blending of dub, new wave, hip hop, and alternative rock. The album's singles "Creator" and "L.E.S. Artistes" gained significant international attention, with "L.E.S. Artistes" reaching the top 40 of the UK Singles Chart and earning her the NME Award for Best Breakthrough Artist in 2008.[1][3] In February 2009, she officially changed her stage name to Santigold due to legal threats from director Santo Victor Rigatuso. Her second album, "Master of My Make-Believe" (2012), continued her artistic trajectory, peaking at number 21 on the Billboard 200 and topping the US Dance/Electronic Albums chart, while spawning the hit single "Disparate Youth." Santigold has continued to evolve artistically with subsequent releases including "99¢" (2016), "I Don't Want: The Gold Fire Sessions" (2018), and "Spirituals" (2022), establishing herself as a versatile artist committed to genre-defying experimentation.[1][3][4]

Throughout her career, Santigold has become known for her fearless approach to musical boundaries, incorporating elements of new wave, punk, electro, reggae, and dub into her work. Her influence extends beyond her own recordings through high-profile collaborations and her work as a songwriter and producer for other artists. She has maintained a strong presence in both underground and mainstream music scenes, performing at major festivals including Lollapalooza and touring extensively across the United States and Europe.[3][4]
