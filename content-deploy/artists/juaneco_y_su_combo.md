## Biography
Juaneco y Su Combo is a pioneering Peruvian band formed in the early 1960s in the Amazonian city of Pucallpa by Juan Wong Paredes, a saxophonist and brickmaker of Chinese descent. Originally named Juaneco y su Conjunto, the group began as a local ensemble playing jazz, cumbia, and various dance standards for their own enjoyment. The band’s sound evolved dramatically when Juan Wong’s son, Juan Wong Popolizio, joined as an accordionist and later took over leadership in 1969, steering the group toward a modern, electrified style that fused traditional Amazonian melodies with psychedelic rock, surf music, and Colombian cumbia influences. Their first major success came with the 1970 single 'Mujer Hilandera,' and their debut LP 'El Gran Cacique' established them as the leading voice of Amazonian cumbia, or 'chicha,' in Peru and beyond.[1][2][4][5]

Juaneco y Su Combo became cultural icons by incorporating indigenous themes, local folklore, and the vibrant spirit of the Peruvian jungle into their music and stage presence, including the use of traditional costumes and references to Amazonian myths. Their energetic performances and innovative sound led them to tour throughout Peru and neighboring countries such as Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela, and Brazil. Despite a tragic plane crash in 1977 that claimed the lives of several members, the band reformed with new musicians and continued to record and perform, helping to cement the legacy of Amazonian cumbia as a vital part of Peru’s musical heritage. Their influence persists, with their songs being covered by newer acts and their style recognized as foundational to the chicha and electrocumbia genres.[1][2][3][4][5]

The group’s resilience in the face of tragedy, their role as cultural ambassadors for the Peruvian Amazon, and their innovative blending of local and global sounds have made Juaneco y Su Combo a lasting symbol of both regional pride and musical creativity.
