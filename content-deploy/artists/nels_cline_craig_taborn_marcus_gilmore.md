## Biography
Nels Cline, born January 4, 1956, in Los Angeles, California, began playing guitar at age 12 alongside his twin brother Alex, a drummer, after being inspired by Jimi Hendrix's 'Manic Depression.' The brothers formed the teenage rock band Homogenized Goo and graduated from University High School, developing musically through influences like Jeff Beck, George Harrison, Pete Townshend, and later electric Miles Davis albums such as *In a Silent Way* and *Bitches Brew*, John Coltrane, Pharaoh Sanders, and Albert Ayler. Under the tutelage of West Coast free jazz icons Vinny Golia and Eric Von Essen, Cline released his debut album *Elegies* in 1980 and collaborated with avant-garde saxophonists Tim Berne and Julius Hemphill in the 1980s.[1][2]

Cline's career expanded across genres in the 1990s and 2000s, leading groups like the Nels Cline Trio, Nels Cline Singers, and Nels Cline 4, with key releases including *Interstellar Space Revisited* (1999), *Instrumentals* (2002), and *The Giant Pin* (2004) on Cryptogramophone. He joined Wilco in 2004, bringing a wild card element to their alternative rock sound, while maintaining a prolific jazz output, contributing to over 200 recordings. Notable works include the Blue Note album *Lovers* (2016), blending romantic standards with experimental pieces, and guitar duo projects with Julian Lage like *Room* and *Currents, Constellations*.[2][3][4][5]

Cline's style fuses free jazz, avant-garde, rock, punk, and experimental elements, earning accolades like Rolling Stone's '20 New Guitar Gods' and 'Top 100 Greatest Guitarists.' His legacy as a guitar polymath spans indie jazz and pop, with ongoing collaborations and leadership in boundary-pushing ensembles.[2][5]

## Fun Facts
- Cline formed his first band, Homogenized Goo, as a teenager with twin brother Alex, directly inspired by Jimi Hendrix's 'Manic Depression,' Jeff Beck's Yardbirds solo, and The Who's 'I Can See for Miles.'
- Punk rock in the 1970s, including Patti Smith and Minutemen, galvanized Cline away from progressive rock aspirations toward improvisational and avant-garde paths.
- Cline joined Wilco after opening for them with Carla Bozulich's project; Jeff Tweedy sought his 'random element' following Leroy Bach's departure.
- He released *Lovers* on Blue Note in 2016, reinterpreting romantic standards alongside Sonic Youth and Annette Peacock material with a large ensemble.
