## Biography
Rhiannon Giddens with Francesco Turrisi is a transatlantic duo that brings together the African American string-band traditions of the United States and the Mediterranean, early‑music, and jazz traditions of Europe. Rhiannon Giddens, originally from Greensboro in the North Carolina Piedmont, first became widely known as co‑founder of the Grammy‑winning string band the Carolina Chocolate Drops, using banjo, fiddle, and voice to reconnect American roots music with its Black history and to foreground stories of people often left out of standard musical narratives. Francesco Turrisi, born in Turin and raised partly in Sicily, trained in jazz and early music in the Netherlands and built a reputation in Ireland and across Europe as a virtuosic multi‑instrumentalist, comfortable on piano, frame drums, lutes, and other instruments.

The pair began working closely around 2018, discovering striking resonances between 19th‑century American minstrel banjo tunes and Mediterranean rhythmic and modal traditions, and they developed a duo project that blends these lineages into a chamber‑like roots sound. Their first duo album, "there is no Other" (2019), explored musical connections across the African diaspora and the Mediterranean world, while "They’re Calling Me Home" (2021), recorded in Ireland during the pandemic, turned to lullabies, spirituals, and songs about longing and mortality; the latter went on to win a Grammy Award for Best Folk Album and cemented the duo’s international profile. Across concerts, recordings, and festival appearances, Giddens and Turrisi use banjo, fiddle, accordion, frame drums, and voice to collapse boundaries between American folk, early music, jazz, and Mediterranean traditions, emphasizing shared roots and histories.

As a duo, their musical style is characterized by sparse but intense arrangements that foreground rhythm, timbre, and text, often reimagining traditional songs alongside original material in ways that highlight migration, displacement, and cultural exchange. Giddens’ clear, operatically trained yet roots‑inflected voice and historical focus combine with Turrisi’s deep knowledge of early and Mediterranean musics to create performances that feel both archival and experimental, connecting spirituals, work songs, and ballads with Middle Eastern and southern Italian grooves. Their work has contributed to ongoing reappraisals of American roots music and global folk traditions, influencing how audiences and fellow musicians think about the intertwined histories of Europe, Africa, and the Americas in song.

## Fun Facts
- Giddens and Turrisi’s musical partnership grew out of a chance meeting in Ireland, where they discovered that 19th‑century American banjo tunes meshed unexpectedly well with Sicilian frame‑drum rhythms.
- Their album "They’re Calling Me Home" was recorded in Ireland during pandemic lockdowns, giving its songs about longing and mortality an unusually immediate emotional context.
- The duo’s live shows often feature an unusually wide array of instruments for a two‑person act, including banjo, fiddle, accordion, piano, and various frame and goblet drums.
- Although rooted in folk and early music, their concerts have appeared in settings ranging from folk festivals to major art museums and concert halls, underscoring their cross‑genre appeal.
