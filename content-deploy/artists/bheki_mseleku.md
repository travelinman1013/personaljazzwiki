## Biography
Bheki Mseleku was born Bhekumuzi Hyacinth Mseleku in Durban, South Africa, in 1955, into a musically inclined but highly religious family. His father, a music teacher with a Cambridge degree, kept the family piano locked to discourage his children from pursuing music, but Bheki's mother and older brother would occasionally give him access to the instrument. Despite losing the upper joints of two fingers on his right hand in a childhood go-kart accident, Mseleku taught himself piano, saxophone, and guitar, developing a unique and expressive style that blended South African melodic sensibilities with post-bop jazz harmonies and rhythms.[1][3][4]

Mseleku began his professional career in the mid-1970s, co-founding the group Spirits Rejoice and playing with Philip Tabane’s Malombo, even appearing at the Newport Jazz Festival in 1977. Disenchanted with the apartheid regime, he left South Africa in the late 1970s, living in Botswana, Sweden, and eventually settling in London. There, he became a fixture at Ronnie Scott’s Jazz Club and released his debut album 'Celebration' in 1991, which was shortlisted for the Mercury Prize. Throughout the 1990s, he collaborated with leading jazz figures such as Joe Henderson, Pharoah Sanders, Elvin Jones, and Abbey Lincoln, further cementing his reputation as a visionary artist who bridged township jazz, spiritual themes, and the broader jazz canon.[1][2][4]

Mseleku’s music is characterized by its spiritual depth, intricate harmonies, and the seamless integration of African and Western jazz traditions. Despite personal and professional challenges, including health issues and the struggle for recognition, he left a lasting legacy as one of South Africa’s most influential jazz musicians, inspiring a new generation of artists both at home and abroad.[1][4]
