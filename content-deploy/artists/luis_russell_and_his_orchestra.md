## Biography
Luis Carl Russell (August 5, 1902 – December 11, 1963) was a pioneering Panamanian jazz pianist, composer, arranger, and bandleader whose orchestra became one of New York’s most advanced jazz groups at the end of the 1920s.[2][3] Born in Bocas del Toro, Panama, he grew up in a musical household where his father led a music school and brass band, and as a youth Luis played piano, organ, violin, guitar, and trombone while accompanying silent films and local ensembles.[1][2][4] After winning $3,000 in a lottery in 1919, he moved with his mother and sister to New Orleans, where he earned a living as a pianist in saloons and brothels and absorbed both formal musicianship and the ear‑driven improvisational practices that shaped early jazz.[1][3][4]

By the early 1920s Russell led small groups and worked with New Orleans reedman Albert Nicholas before heading to Chicago in 1925 to join King Oliver’s band and, shortly afterward, serving as its musical director.[1][2][3][4] He moved with Oliver to New York in 1927, then formed his own Luis Russell Orchestra, initially staffed by several former Oliver sidemen; by 1929 it was a ten‑piece outfit regarded as one of the city’s leading jazz bands and a crucial precursor of swing.[2][3][4] Between 1926 and 1934 he recorded dozens of sides under his own name and others, featuring future stars such as Red Allen, J. C. Higginbotham, Albert Nicholas, Pops Foster, Paul Barbarin, and occasionally Louis Armstrong, whose early big‑band recordings the Russell orchestra frequently backed.[2][3][4]

In 1935 Armstrong took over the Russell orchestra as his full‑time big band, with Russell acting as musical director and arranger for the next eight years while the group toured widely and helped define Armstrong’s Swing Era sound.[1][2][3][4] Russell re‑formed his own band from 1943 to 1948, playing venues like the Savoy Ballroom and Apollo Theater and recording titles including a 1946 version of “The Very Thought of You,” before largely withdrawing from full‑time performance to run small businesses in New York while still taking occasional gigs and teaching music.[2][3][4] In 1959 he returned to Panama for a classical piano recital, underscoring the breadth of his training, and he died in New York City in 1963 at age 61; his daughter Catherine Russell later emerged as a noted jazz vocalist, helping to renew interest in his legacy as a vital but often under‑recognized link between New Orleans jazz and the Swing Era.[2][3][4]

## Fun Facts
- Luis Russell financed his family’s move from Panama to New Orleans in 1919 with money he won in a lottery—reported as about $3,000, a substantial sum at the time.[3]
- Before becoming known as a bandleader, Russell accompanied silent films and worked in New Orleans saloons and brothels, gaining practical experience in everything from background music to hot jazz improvisation.[1][3][4]
- Many jazz historians regard Russell’s 1928–1930 recordings as some of the very first fully formed swing records, predating the Swing Era by several years.[1][3][4]
- Late in life, after largely retiring from full‑time performance, Russell ran small businesses in New York—including a notions, candy, and toy shop—and in 1959 he surprised many by returning to Panama to give a classical piano recital.[2][3]
