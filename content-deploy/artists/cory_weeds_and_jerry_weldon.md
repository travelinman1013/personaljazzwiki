## Biography
Cory Weeds & Jerry Weldon is a saxophone-fronted jazz partnership that unites Canadian impresario and tenor/alto saxophonist Cory Weeds with New York tenor saxophonist Jerry Weldon, a veteran of the hard‑swinging soul‑jazz tradition.[3][4][5][8] Their collaboration is rooted in the classic tenor‑sax ‘battle’ lineage, drawing on the example of Gene Ammons, Dexter Gordon, Eddie “Lockjaw” Davis and Johnny Griffin, and presenting it in a contemporary setting that emphasizes blues feeling, relaxed but propulsive swing, and conversational improvisation.[3][5] Although both had crossed paths professionally over the years, their work as a co‑billed recording and touring act crystallized around the Cellar Music Group album *Cory Weeds Meets Jerry Weldon* (2025), which showcases their intertwined but contrasting approaches over a rhythm section of Miles Black (piano), John Lee (bass), and Jesse Cahill (drums).[3][5][8]

The project grows out of Weeds’s dual identity as a performer and one of Canada’s leading jazz entrepreneurs—founder of Vancouver’s Cellar Jazz Club and of the Cellar Music Group label—and Weldon’s long career in New York with big bands, organ groups, and small‑group soul jazz.[4][6][8][9] Together they explore repertoire associated with earlier tenor giants (such as Eddie “Lockjaw” Davis’s “Hey Lock” and Clifford Jordan’s “Princess”), with Weldon bringing a commanding, blues‑inflected sound and ‘bar‑walkin’’ energy, while Weeds offers a cooler, highly articulate swing feel rooted in bebop and hard bop.[1][2][5] Critics have described their joint work as a “marriage of two musicians” that feels “divinely inspired” and “way overdue,” highlighting the group as a continuation of the classic two‑tenor tradition for modern audiences and solidifying their reputation as leading voices in mainstream and soul‑jazz idioms.[3][5][7][9]

Beyond the recording studio, Cory Weeds & Jerry Weldon function as a flexible touring unit—often as the Cory Weeds Quintet featuring Jerry Weldon—appearing at clubs and festivals across North America under Weeds’s Cellar Music umbrella.[1][2][8][9] Live, the ensemble leans into call‑and‑response exchanges, unison shout choruses, and extended solos that reflect both musicians’ deep experience working with organists, big bands, and small‑group hard bop settings.[3][4][5][8] In this way, the collaboration serves both as a platform for their individual artistry and as a conduit connecting regional Canadian jazz scenes and the New York mainstream, contributing to the preservation and ongoing evolution of straight‑ahead, swinging jazz.[3][4][6][8][9]
