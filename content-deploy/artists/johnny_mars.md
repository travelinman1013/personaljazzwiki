## Biography
Johnny Mars is an American electric blues harmonica player, singer, and songwriter, known for his powerful amplified harp sound, soulful vocals, and a career that has bridged the U.S. and U.K. blues scenes.[2][4][6] He was born Johnny Mars in Laurens, South Carolina, to African American sharecropping parents, and grew up in a rural, segregated environment where music and church were central parts of community life.[4][6] Mars was given his first harmonica at the age of nine, and by his early teens he was playing in local bands, already absorbing postwar electric blues, soul, and early rock ’n’ roll as his primary musical language.[6] After his mother died when he was a teenager, the family moved to New York, where Mars continued to develop as a working musician in tough club environments, sharpening both his stagecraft and his distinctive, high‑energy harmonica style.[4][6]

From the 1960s onward, Mars worked with a variety of bands and eventually formed his own groups, building a reputation for intense live performances and a modern, electric blues sound that still honored traditional roots.[3][6] He later made the United Kingdom his home, becoming a fixture on the European blues and festival circuit and forming various bands there, while also touring widely across Europe and beyond.[3] In 1994 he returned to the U.S. to record stateside with Dan Kennedy and Bill Martin, underlining his transatlantic profile.[3] Musically, Mars combines Chicago‑style electric blues harmonica with elements of soul, funk, and R&B, often using a heavily amplified tone and dramatic stage presence that place him in the lineage of blues showmen while bringing a contemporary edge. Over several decades he has become respected not only as a performer and recording artist but also as an educator and storyteller, giving talks (including during Black History Month) and harmonica lessons that share both the technical craft of blues harp and the social history behind the music.[2][3] His legacy rests in his role as a bridge between U.S. and U.K. blues communities and as a carrier of African American blues tradition into modern contexts.[2][3][4]
