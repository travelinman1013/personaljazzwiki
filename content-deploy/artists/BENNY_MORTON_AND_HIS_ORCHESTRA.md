## Biography
Benny Morton (January 31, 1907 – December 28, 1985) was an influential American jazz trombonist, most associated with the swing era. Born in New York City, Morton received his early musical training at Textile High School, where he began performing with school friends and was influenced by his step-father, a violinist. His first professional engagement came at age 17 with Billy Fowler’s Orchestra, and he soon joined Fletcher Henderson’s orchestra in 1926, where he developed his own trombone style under the mentorship of Jimmy Harrison.

Morton’s career flourished as he alternated between major bands, including Chick Webb’s and Don Redman’s orchestras throughout the 1930s. He joined Count Basie’s orchestra in 1937, remaining until 1940, and later played with Teddy Wilson’s sextet and Edmond Hall’s band. Morton’s trombone playing was noted for its soft, smooth tone, wide range, and facility in all registers, blending early 'hot' jazz techniques with elegant swing phrasing. He was also recognized as an excellent 'tailgate' player, adept at Dixieland revival styles later in his career.

Though primarily a sideman and soloist, Morton occasionally led his own bands, including a notable 1934 recording session as Benny Morton & His Orchestra. He collaborated with many jazz greats, appeared on Billie Holiday’s 'The Sound of Jazz,' and remained active in ensembles and New York theater orchestras into the 1970s. Morton’s legacy is defined by his tasteful understatement, advanced chromaticism, and his role in shaping the sound of swing trombone.
