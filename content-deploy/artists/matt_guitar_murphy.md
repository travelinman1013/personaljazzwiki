## Biography
Matthew Tyler Murphy, known as Matt 'Guitar' Murphy, was born on December 29, 1929, in Sunflower, Mississippi, and raised in Memphis, Tennessee, where he learned guitar as a child and immersed himself in the local blues scene alongside his brother Floyd. By 1948, he moved to Chicago, joining Howlin' Wolf's band featuring Little Junior Parker, and soon recorded with Parker and Ike Turner on tracks like 'You're My Angel' / 'Bad Women, Bad Whiskey.' His career flourished in the 1950s with extensive work alongside Memphis Slim on albums such as *At the Gate of Horn* (1959), where his jazz-tinged, rapid-fire picking elevated the music, blending blues with sophisticated riffing.[1][2][4]

Murphy's versatility shone through collaborations with Chuck Berry, Koko Taylor, Sonny Boy Williamson II, Buddy Guy, Etta James, Otis Rush, Muddy Waters, and Willie Dixon, including standout performances on the 1963 American Folk Blues Festival tour in Europe with 'Matt's Guitar Boogie.' In the 1970s, he recorded over six albums with James Cotton, catching the attention of Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi, leading to his iconic role as lead guitarist in The Blues Brothers band, appearing in the 1980 film *The Blues Brothers* and 1998 sequel *Blues Brothers 2000* as Aretha Franklin's husband. He continued performing until a stroke in the early 2000s, returning briefly in 2009, and was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 2012.[1][3][4]

Murphy's musical style fused classic blues with jazz influences, known for clean, advanced riffing that influenced peers like Freddie King, whose 'Hide Away' drew from Murphy's playing. A lifelong sideman who occasionally led his own bands, he released solo albums like *Way Down South* (1990) with brother Floyd for Antone's, cementing his legacy as a blues guitar pioneer until his death on June 15, 2018.[1][4][6]
