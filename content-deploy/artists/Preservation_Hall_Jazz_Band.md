## Biography
Preservation Hall Jazz Band is a legendary ensemble rooted in the vibrant musical culture of New Orleans, Louisiana. The band was formed in 1961, named after the iconic Preservation Hall venue in the French Quarter, which was established by Allan and Sandra Jaffe to promote and preserve the authentic sound of traditional New Orleans jazz. The venue quickly became a gathering place for some of the city's most revered jazz musicians, many of whom had direct ties to the early days of jazz, including artists who played with pioneers like Louis Armstrong and Jelly Roll Morton. 

From its inception, the band has been dedicated to nurturing and perpetuating the art form of New Orleans jazz, touring internationally since 1963 and performing at prestigious venues such as Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center. Over the decades, the band has seen a rotating lineup of musicians, blending generations and backgrounds, with leadership passing from early figures like Sweet Emma Barrett and the Humphrey brothers to current director Ben Jaffe, son of the founders. Under Ben Jaffe's guidance, the band has embraced collaborations with contemporary artists and infused new energy into its repertoire, ensuring the continued relevance and vitality of New Orleans jazz. 

Musically, Preservation Hall Jazz Band is known for its spirited interpretations of classic jazz, swing, ragtime, and Cajun music, characterized by joyful improvisation and a deep reverence for tradition. Their legacy is not only in the preservation of a musical style but also in their role as cultural ambassadors, breaking racial barriers and inspiring new generations of musicians around the world.
