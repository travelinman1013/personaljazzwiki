## Biography
Cyrille Aimée Daudel was born on August 10, 1984, in Samois-sur-Seine, France, a village near Fontainebleau that hosts the annual Django Reinhardt Festival. She grew up in a multilingual household filled with music, shaped by her French father and Dominican mother's diverse influences—from Afro-Caribbean rhythms like bachata and merengue to the vibrant gypsy jazz traditions of her hometown. As a teenager, she famously climbed out of her bedroom window to sneak into the gypsy encampments during the Django Reinhardt Festival, where she absorbed the spontaneous, nomadic spirit of gypsy musicians and developed a lifelong passion for jazz improvisation. This early exposure to multiple musical traditions—including French chanson, flamenco, country-western, and Michael Jackson—created the eclectic foundation that would define her artistic identity.

Aimée's formal training began at the American School of Modern Music in Paris before she moved to the United States to attend SUNY Purchase on scholarship, drawn by its proximity to Manhattan's jazz scene. During her early years in New York, she honed her craft through nightly performances at prestigious venues including Birdland Jazz Club, Smalls Jazz Club in Greenwich Village, and a Soho restaurant, where she earned a reputation as a fearless improviser and matchless interpreter of song. Her breakthrough came in 2007 when she won the Montreux Jazz Festival vocal competition, using the prize money to record her debut album "Cyrille Aimée & the Surreal Band." This victory launched a remarkable trajectory of accolades, including finalist status in the 2010 Thelonious Monk International Jazz Vocal Competition and victory at the 2012 Sarah Vaughan International Jazz Vocal Competition. Her 2014 major label debut "It's A Good Day" on Mack Avenue Records showcased her innovative quintet featuring guitarists Michael Valeanu and Adrien Moignard, while her album "Move On" featuring Stephen Sondheim compositions earned a Grammy nomination. Today, Cyrille Aimée is recognized as one of the most promising jazz singers of her generation, celebrated for her bold improvisational style, magnetic stage presence, and unique ability to blend gypsy jazz, Brazilian bossa nova, Latin grooves, and Caribbean rhythms into a cohesive artistic vision.
