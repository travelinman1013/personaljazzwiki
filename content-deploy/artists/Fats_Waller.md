## Biography
Thomas Wright "Fats" Waller was born on May 21, 1904, in Harlem, New York City, the youngest of eleven children in a deeply religious family. His father, a lay preacher, hoped he would pursue the ministry, and Waller began playing the organ in his father's church as a child. After his mother's death during his teenage years, Waller moved in with the family of pianist Russell Brooks, who introduced him to James P. Johnson, a pivotal figure in stride piano. Johnson became Waller's mentor, guiding him into the vibrant Harlem rent party scene and shaping his early musical development[5][6][8].

Waller's professional career began at age 15, performing in cabarets and theaters, and he quickly gained recognition for his virtuosic piano technique and charismatic stage presence. By the late 1920s, he was an established songwriter, contributing to Broadway revues and collaborating with lyricist Andy Razaf. His best-known compositions, including "Ain't Misbehavin'" and "Honeysuckle Rose," became jazz standards and were later inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame[2][4][5]. From 1934 onward, Waller led his own small group, Fats Waller and His Rhythm, recording hundreds of tracks that blended sophisticated jazz with comedic flair. He was also the first prominent jazz musician to master the pipe organ, expanding the instrument's role in jazz[2][3][5].

Waller's infectious rhythms, witty improvisations, and genial clowning made him a beloved figure in the swing and jazz eras, both in the United States and internationally. Despite his comedic persona often overshadowing his technical brilliance, he is remembered as a foundational figure in modern jazz piano and stride style. His influence extended far beyond his own recordings, inspiring generations of musicians. Waller died of pneumonia on December 15, 1943, in Kansas City, Missouri, at the age of 39, leaving behind a legacy of over 400 copyrighted songs and a lasting impact on American music[2][4][5].
