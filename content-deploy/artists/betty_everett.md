## Biography
Betty Everett was born on November 23, 1939, in Greenwood, Mississippi, where she began singing and playing piano in church at the age of nine. Immersed in gospel music from a young age, she developed a strong musical foundation before moving to Chicago in 1957 to pursue a career in secular music. There, she recorded for several local labels and briefly sang lead with the Daylighters, gaining experience in the vibrant Chicago soul scene.

Everett's breakthrough came after signing with Vee-Jay Records in 1963, under the guidance of A&R director Calvin Carter. Her early singles included a cover of 'You're No Good,' but it was 'The Shoop Shoop Song (It's in His Kiss)' in 1964 that became her signature hit, reaching No. 6 on the Billboard Hot 100 and topping the Cashbox R&B chart. She also found success with duets alongside Jerry Butler, most notably 'Let It Be Me,' which reached the US Top 5. Throughout the late 1960s and 1970s, Everett recorded for several labels, scoring another major hit with 'There'll Come a Time' in 1969. Her style blended northern soul, doo-wop, and Motown influences, marked by her expressive vocals and piano skills.

Everett's legacy endures through her influential recordings and her impact on the soul and R&B genres. She was inducted into the Rhythm and Blues Foundation's Hall of Fame in 1996 and continued to perform into the 1990s. Her music has been covered by numerous artists, and 'The Shoop Shoop Song' experienced renewed popularity in the 1990s after being featured in the film 'Mermaids.'
