## Biography
Johnny Jones was born on November 1, 1924, in Jackson, Mississippi, and was a cousin of the legendary blues pianist Otis Spann. Growing up in a musical family, Jones learned piano and harmonica as a child, drawing inspiration from Spann and the influential blues pianist Big Maceo Merriweather. In the mid-1940s, Jones and his family moved to Chicago, where he quickly established himself on the vibrant blues scene, performing with Tampa Red and recording with Muddy Waters by 1950.

Jones became renowned as one of the greatest piano players in Chicago blues, celebrated for his expressive playing and ability to blend traditional Mississippi blues with the urban sound of Chicago. His most notable musical partnership was with slide guitarist Elmore James, with whom he performed and recorded extensively from 1952 to 1956. Jones also collaborated with other blues legends such as Jimmy Reed, Howlin' Wolf, Billy Boy Arnold, Magic Sam, and Sonny Boy Williamson, often serving as a session pianist and bandleader throughout the 1950s and early 1960s.

Despite health challenges later in life, including lung problems and a cancer diagnosis in 1963, Jones continued to perform and record until his death in Chicago on November 19, 1964. His legacy endures through classic recordings like "Big Town Playboy" and his influential work with Elmore James, which helped shape the sound of Chicago blues for generations.
