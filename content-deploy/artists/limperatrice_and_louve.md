## Biography
L'Impératrice is a French pop and nu-disco band that originated in Paris in 2012, founded by keyboardist and songwriter Charles de Boisseguin. Initially conceived as a solo project, the group gradually expanded to include Hagni Gwon (keyboards), David Gaugué (bass), Tom Daveau (drums), and Achille Trocellier (guitar), with each member joining through a network of musical acquaintances. For the first three years, the band focused on instrumental music, aiming to offer an alternative to standard pop formats. In 2015, vocalist Flore Benguigui joined, marking a turning point in the band's sound and international reach, particularly with her debut on the EP 'Odyssée.'

L'Impératrice is known for blending '70s space disco, '90s synth pop, French house, new wave, Eurodisco, jazz, and funk, creating a lush, cinematic, and danceable sound that is both retro and modern. Their critically acclaimed albums, including 'Matahari' (2018), 'Tako Tsubo' (2021), and 'Pulsar' (2024), have cemented their reputation for sophisticated pop with a distinctly French flair. In September 2024, Benguigui departed the band, citing personal and artistic disagreements, and was soon replaced by French artist Louve as the new lead vocalist, signaling a new chapter for the group.

With Louve now fronting the band, L'Impératrice continues to evolve its sound while maintaining its core identity rooted in analog disco and dreamy Europop. Their music is celebrated for its intricate arrangements, infectious grooves, and a playful yet polished aesthetic that appeals to both nostalgic and contemporary audiences.
