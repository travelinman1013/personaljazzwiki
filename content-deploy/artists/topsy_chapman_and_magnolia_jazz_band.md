## Biography
Topsy Chapman (1947–2022) was a legendary jazz and gospel vocalist from New Orleans, Louisiana, born in Kentwood. She demonstrated extraordinary musical talent from an early age, singing and playing piano by age 3 and earning money performing in churches by age 6 or 7, thanks to her father Norwood's role as a preacher and vocal music instructor. After high school, Chapman moved to New Orleans at age 17, where she formed The Chapmans gospel group and quickly became a fixture in the local music scene, performing regularly at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival and various clubs throughout the city.

Chapman's career reached international prominence in 1978 when she was selected as an original cast member of the off-Broadway hit musical "One Mo' Time," a production set in 1920s New Orleans black vaudeville that premiered at the Toulouse Theatre in the French Quarter before traveling to New York's Village Gate, London's West End, and touring extensively throughout Europe. This breakthrough led to performances for world leaders including the Queen of England and the Duke of Edinburgh, Grammy nominations, critical acclaim from major publications including the New York Times and Variety, and appearances on Garrison Keillor's "A Prairie Home Companion." She also appeared in the award-winning 2013 film "12 Years a Slave."

Throughout her career, Chapman maintained deep roots in gospel music while performing traditional and modern New Orleans jazz with some of the city's finest musicians. Known for her beautifully powerful voice, impeccable phrasing, and masterful musicianship, she performed at prestigious venues including the Palm Court Jazz Café, Snug Harbor, and Donna's, and toured extensively across Europe, Asia, Australia, and the Americas. Her legacy continues through her daughters Yolanda Robinson and Jolynda Phillips, who perform as Topsy Chapman and Solid Harmony, carrying forward the musical traditions their mother championed until her death in 2022 at age 75.
