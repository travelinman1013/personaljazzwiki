## Biography
Bessie Smith, born in Chattanooga, Tennessee in 1894, rose from a childhood marked by poverty and loss to become one of the most influential blues singers of the 20th century. Orphaned at a young age, Smith and her siblings survived by performing on street corners, with Bessie singing and dancing while her brother played guitar. Her early exposure to performance led her to join traveling minstrel shows, and by 1912, she was performing as a dancer with the Moses Stokes troupe, where she met the legendary blues singer Ma Rainey. Although Rainey did not formally teach Smith to sing, she played a crucial role in helping Smith develop her stage presence and confidence, shaping her early career.[1][2][3][4]

Smith's powerful, emotive voice and commanding stage presence quickly set her apart. In 1923, she recorded 'Downhearted Blues,' which became a massive hit and launched her recording career with Columbia Records. Over the next decade, Smith recorded more than 160 songs, becoming one of the highest-paid Black performers of her era and earning the title 'Empress of the Blues.' Her music blended classic blues with elements of jazz and ragtime, and her songs often addressed the struggles and injustices faced by African Americans. Despite a decline in popularity during the 1930s due to changing musical tastes and the Great Depression, Smith continued to perform until her untimely death in a car accident in 1937. Her legacy endures, as she paved the way for future generations of blues and jazz musicians and remains a symbol of resilience and artistry.[1][2][3][4]
