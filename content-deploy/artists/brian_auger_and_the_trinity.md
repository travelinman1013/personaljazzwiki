## Biography
Brian Auger and the Trinity was a British jazz-rock fusion band formed in November 1964, led by keyboardist and Hammond B-3 organist Brian Auger. The band emerged from London's vibrant soul-jazz scene during the mid-1960s, initially operating as a traditional jazz outfit before evolving into a pioneering fusion ensemble. Auger's early exposure came through his work on the London jazz club circuit, but his career trajectory shifted dramatically in 1965 when he was recruited by Long John Baldry to form Steampacket, a self-contained touring revue that also featured a young Rod Stewart. This experience exposed Auger to diverse musical influences ranging from Chicago blues to Motown, fundamentally shaping his artistic direction. After Steampacket disbanded in 1966, Auger reformed the Trinity with a new vision, eventually recruiting vocalist Julie Driscoll, whose powerful voice and emotional delivery became central to the band's identity.

The Brian Auger Trinity achieved international recognition following their 1967 debut album 'Open,' which showcased an innovative blend of swamp blues, hard-jamming jazz, and psychedelic rock elements. Their breakthrough came with the 1968 hit single 'This Wheel's on Fire,' a duet between Auger and Driscoll that reached number 5 on the UK Singles Chart and number 13 in Canada. The band made history by becoming the first rock-jazz ensemble to headline the Montreux Jazz Festival in 1968. Their ambitious double album 'Streetnoise' (1969) demonstrated their artistic range, featuring everything from art rock to interpretations of contemporary songs by Laura Nyro and material from the musical 'Hair.' The Trinity's success on both sides of the Atlantic led to appearances on American television, including a Monkees TV special that introduced the band to American audiences. After the band's dissolution in the early 1970s, Auger continued his career with Oblivion Express, a jazz fusion project that achieved the rare distinction of charting simultaneously on jazz, rock, and soul charts, cementing his legacy as a pioneering figure in jazz fusion.
