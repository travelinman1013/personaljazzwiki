## Biography
Al Cohn (November 24, 1925 – February 15, 1988) was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York, where he initially studied piano and clarinet before being inspired by Lester Young to take up the tenor saxophone, which he taught himself to play. Making his professional debut at age 18 in 1943 with Joe Marsala's big band, Cohn quickly progressed through associations with Georgie Auld, Boyd Raeburn, Alvino Rey, and Buddy Rich, establishing himself as a skilled jazz saxophonist, arranger, and composer.[1][2][4]

Cohn rose to prominence replacing Herbie Steward in Woody Herman's Second Herd (1948-1949) as part of the famed 'Four Brothers' saxophone section alongside Zoot Sims, Stan Getz, and Serge Chaloff, contributing to the band's signature sound on Jimmy Giuffre's 'Four Brothers.'[1][2][3][6] Throughout the 1950s and beyond, he led recording sessions, arranged for jazz and non-jazz projects including TV, Broadway musicals like Raisin (1973) and Sophisticated Ladies (1981), and the Jack Sterling WCBS radio show, while co-leading a quintet with Zoot Sims from 1956 or 1957 through the early 1980s, performing regularly at NYC's Half Note and touring internationally.[1][4][5] His warm tone, influenced by Lester Young, and unpretentious arrangements marked his versatile style.[1][4]

Cohn's legacy endures through over 100 original compositions, all recorded, more than 50 leader albums, appearances on 350+ others, four Grammy nominations, and posthumous inductions into the American Jazz Hall of Fame and ASCAP Wall of Fame. He performed with Elvis Presley in 1972, appeared in films like 'The Great Rocky Mountain Jazz Party' (1977) and contributed to the 'Lenny' soundtrack (1974).[1][5]
