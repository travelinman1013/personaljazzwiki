## Biography
The Ohio Penitentiary 511 Jazz Ensemble was a unique musical collective formed in 1971 within the walls of the Ohio State Penitentiary, a pre-Civil War stone fortress in downtown Columbus, Ohio. The ensemble was founded by two educated musicians who found themselves incarcerated together: trumpeter Reynard Birtha and saxophonist Logan Rollins, nephew of legendary jazz saxophonist Sonny Rollins. Both Birtha and Rollins had studied at conservatories before their incarceration and were well-versed in post-bop and the energetic free jazz that had emerged in the late 1960s. They pulled together musicians from the prison's disbanded Pitt Band, creating an ensemble that would produce one remarkable album before dissolving upon the release of its leaders.

The group's only recording, Hard Luck Soul, was made in 1971 in the prison's chapel with assistance from members of the Ohio State University Band, who had been so impressed by the inmates' jamming sessions that they returned to help record the album. The private-pressing featured four original compositions, presumably arranged by Birtha and Rollins, showcasing a soul jazz sound built on rolling grooves that allowed the trumpet and saxophone to soar. The group was inspired by visiting musicians like Art Blakey and Kai Winding who came to entertain the inmates. The album included extended pieces like the 11-minute "Psyche City" and the nearly 12-minute "Counterry Bosa Deva," which demonstrated the musicians' ability to transcend their physical confinement through their art.

After Birtha and Rollins were released from prison, the ensemble evaporated, and Hard Luck Soul remained the only album either man ever recorded. Reynard Birtha spent a lifetime struggling with crime and addiction, eventually living in a senior citizens complex in Columbus when the album was reissued in 2012 through London's Jazzman Holy Grail Series. Of Logan Rollins, no further information is available after his release, and he is not mentioned in the definitive Saxophone Colossus biography of his uncle Sonny Rollins. The album stands as a testament to the power of jazz as a vehicle for freedom and expression, even within the most restrictive circumstances.
