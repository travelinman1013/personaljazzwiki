## Biography
Branford Marsalis, born August 26, 1960, in New Orleans, Louisiana, is an acclaimed American saxophonist, composer, and bandleader known for his versatility and innovation in jazz and beyond. Raised in a musical family—his father Ellis Marsalis was a renowned pianist and educator—Branford began on clarinet before moving to saxophone as a teenager, performing in local bands. He studied at Southern University and Berklee College of Music, where his growing passion for jazz led to early professional opportunities with trumpet legend Clark Terry and, alongside his brother Wynton, in Art Blakey’s Jazz Messengers. This period established Branford as a leading figure in the 'Young Lions' movement, revitalizing acoustic jazz in the 1980s.

Marsalis’s career is marked by both tradition and boundary-pushing. After co-founding the Wynton Marsalis Quintet, he formed his own quartet in 1986, which remains his primary creative outlet. The Branford Marsalis Quartet is celebrated for its deep repertoire, expressive melodies, and the remarkable cohesion of its members. Marsalis has also collaborated with pop and rock artists, most notably touring and recording with Sting in the mid-1980s, and served as the first music director for The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. His projects span jazz, funk/hip-hop (with Buckshot LeFonque), and classical music, including performances with major orchestras and chamber ensembles. Marsalis’s contributions have earned him multiple Grammy Awards, a Tony nomination, and recognition as a Jazz Master by the National Endowment for the Arts, cementing his legacy as a leading voice in contemporary music.
