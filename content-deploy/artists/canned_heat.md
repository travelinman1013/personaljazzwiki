## Biography
Canned Heat is an American blues rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1965 by two dedicated blues enthusiasts and record collectors, Alan Wilson and Bob Hite. The band's name was derived from Tommy Johnson's 1928 blues standard "Canned Heat Blues," a song about an alcoholic who turned to drinking Sterno during prohibition. Wilson and Hite founded the group within a vibrant community of blues collectors, with Wilson's house in Topanga Canyon serving as a meeting place for musicians and fans passionate about blues music. The band's initial lineup included Bob Hite on vocals, Alan Wilson on bottleneck guitar, Mike Perlowin on lead guitar, Stu Brotman on bass, and Keith Sawyer on drums, though this configuration evolved significantly in their early years.

Canned Heat achieved their classic and most influential lineup by early 1967, consisting of Bob Hite (vocals), Alan Wilson (guitar, harmonica, and vocals), Henry Vestine or Harvey Mandel (lead guitar), Larry Taylor (bass), and Adolfo de la Parra (drums). The band began recording in April 1967 for Liberty Records and released their self-titled debut album in July 1967, which reached #76 on the Billboard chart. Their reputation grew substantially following performances at the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival and a headlining slot at Woodstock in 1969. Canned Heat achieved three worldwide hits with "On The Road Again," "Going Up The Country," and "Let's Work Together," establishing themselves as significant figures in blues rock. However, the band's trajectory was dramatically altered on September 3, 1970, when co-founder Alan Wilson died from a barbiturate overdose, fundamentally changing the group's musical direction and never allowing them to fully recapture their earlier creative force.

Despite Wilson's death, Canned Heat persisted through various lineup changes and continued recording and performing for decades. The band maintained their commitment to promoting blues music and its original artists, serving as important ambassadors for the genre during the rock era. Their legacy encompasses not only their commercial success and festival performances but also their role in introducing blues music to wider audiences and their collaborations with blues legends. The classic period of Canned Heat, spanning from March 1967 to September 1970, remains their most celebrated era, representing a unique moment when passionate blues enthusiasts successfully bridged traditional blues with contemporary rock audiences.

## Fun Facts
- The band's name came from a euphemism for Sterno, a cooking fuel that desperate alcoholics drank during prohibition. Tommy Johnson's 1928 blues standard 'Canned Heat Blues' told this story, and Wilson and Hite chose this name to honor the blues tradition they were reviving.
- Early in their career, a Liberty Records executive suggested the band wear overalls on stage, thinking that's what Delta blues musicians wore. In reality, Black bluesmen typically wore their Sunday best when performing. The band complied, and roadie Barry Hansen's job included finding laundromats to wash the overalls between gigs.
- Alan Wilson, the band's co-founder and creative heart, was born on July 4, 1943, and earned the nickname 'Blind Owl' despite not being blind. He died tragically at just 27 years old on September 3, 1970, from a barbiturate overdose on a hillside behind Bob Hite's home, fundamentally altering the band's trajectory.
- Henry Vestine was fired from Frank Zappa's Mothers of Invention because he lacked the feel for Zappa's complex material and, according to Zappa, enjoyed his drugs too much. He went on to become one of the best blues guitarists in Los Angeles and a key member of Canned Heat's classic lineup.
