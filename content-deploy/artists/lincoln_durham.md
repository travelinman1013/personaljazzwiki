## Biography
Lincoln Durham is a Southern Gothic, blues-influenced one-man band known for his raw, electrifying performances and dark, poetic songwriting. Born and raised in Itasca, Texas, Durham's musical journey began at the age of four when his grandfather and father placed a fiddle in his hands. By age ten, he had already won the Youth Fiddle Championship, and soon after, he was performing in local opry bands, playing classic country covers for small-town audiences. As he matured, Durham gravitated toward the guitar, particularly the acoustic slide guitar, and began developing a unique sound that fused traditional blues with punk, country, and Southern Gothic influences.[1][2][3]

Durham's career took a pivotal turn after a period performing in the duo Liz and Lincoln with his then-wife Liz Foster. Following their split, Durham re-emerged as a solo artist, embracing the one-man band format and releasing his debut album 'The Shovel vs. the Howling Bones' in 2012. This album, co-produced by Texas music legend Ray Wylie Hubbard, showcased Durham's gritty vocals, unconventional instrumentation, and storytelling prowess. Subsequent releases, including 'Exodus of the Deemed Unrighteous' and 'Revelations of a Mind Unraveling,' further established his reputation for blending blues, punk, and Southern Gothic themes, earning critical acclaim for both his studio work and his intense, sweat-drenched live shows.[1][2][3]

Durham's music is characterized by his use of vintage and homemade instruments, including battered guitars, fiddles, banjos, and improvised percussion, creating a sound that is both timeless and innovative. His lyrical themes often explore darkness, redemption, and the human condition, drawing comparisons to artists like Son House, Fred McDowell, Tom Waits, and Nick Cave. Durham's legacy lies in his ability to channel the spirit of old blues masters while forging a fiercely individual path, captivating audiences with his visceral, deeply personal performances.[1][2][3]

## Fun Facts
- Durham often performs as a true one-man band, simultaneously playing guitar, fiddle, harmonica, and improvised percussion using his hands and feet.[1][2]
- He still plays the same fiddle his father made for him when he was ten years old.[3]
- Durham's live shows are known for their intensity and intimacy, often leaving him drenched in sweat and emotionally spent.[1][2]
- His music draws heavily from literary influences, with critics noting that his lyrics evoke the gothic storytelling of Edgar Allan Poe.[1][2]
