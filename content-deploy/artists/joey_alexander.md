## Biography
Joey Alexander, born Josiah Alexander Sila on June 25, 2003, in Denpasar, Bali, Indonesia, discovered the piano at age six by picking out jazz melodies like Thelonious Monk’s “Well, You Needn’t” from his father’s record collection by ear. His father, an amateur musician, mentored him early on, introducing classic jazz recordings and taking him to jam sessions in Bali and Jakarta, fostering his swing and improvisation skills without formal training. Early influences included Duke Ellington, Thelonious Monk, Bill Evans, John Coltrane, and trumpet players like Clifford Brown, Lee Morgan, Miles Davis, and Wynton Marsalis[1][2].

At age eight, UNESCO invited him to perform for Herbie Hancock in Indonesia, whose encouragement inspired Alexander to dedicate his life to jazz; he later won the Grand Prix at the 2013 Master-Jam Fest in Ukraine at age nine, besting professionals from 17 countries. In 2014, at Wynton Marsalis's invitation, he performed at Jazz at Lincoln Center galas in New York, leading his family to relocate there. His debut album *My Favorite Things* (2015, Motéma Music), released at age 11, featured his arrangements of standards like “Giant Steps” and charted on Billboard 200, earning Grammy nominations; he became the first Indonesian to perform at the Grammys[2][6]. Subsequent albums like *Countdown* (2016) continued his rise, blending hard-bop with adventurous improvisation[2][3].

Now based in New York, Alexander has performed for figures like Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, and at major festivals including Newport and Montreal. His style evokes 1950s hard-bop with dynamic phrasing, authoritative technique, and emotional depth, earning praise as a wunderkind who has matured into a composer of fertile imagination, with seven leader albums and three Grammy nominations[1][4][6].
