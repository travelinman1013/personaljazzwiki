## Biography
Dave Brubeck (1920-2012) and Louis Armstrong (1901-1971) were two jazz icons whose paths converged in a landmark collaboration during the late 1950s and early 1960s. Brubeck, a pioneering pianist known for cool jazz and complex rhythms, developed the jazz musical 'The Real Ambassadors' alongside his wife Iola Brubeck, drawing from their experiences as U.S. State Department cultural ambassadors touring abroad during the Cold War[1][2]. Armstrong, the legendary trumpeter and vocalist revered as a foundational figure in jazz, brought emotional depth to the project, which addressed civil rights, racial segregation, and America's global hypocrisy[1][2].

Their sole major collaboration, 'The Real Ambassadors,' premiered in a live performance at the 1962 Monterey Jazz Festival, featuring Brubeck's quartet (with bassist Gene Wright and drummer Joe Morello), Armstrong's All-Stars (including Trummy Young, Joe Darensbourg, and Billy Kyle), Lambert, Hendricks & Ross, and Carmen McRae[1][5]. A studio album was released by Columbia Records in 1962, capturing songs like 'They Say I Look Like God,' where Armstrong delivered a raw, straight-faced rendition critiquing racism[1][3]. Intended for Broadway, the musical highlighted Brubeck's integrationist stance—he canceled Southern tours rather than drop Black bassist Eugene Wright—and Armstrong's lifelong struggles with racial prejudice[2].

The work's legacy endures as a bold statement on civil rights through jazz, influencing later performances and scholarship, including a 2002 Monterey revival and a 2023 book by Keith Hatschek[1][2][6]. It exemplified their shared commitment to using music for social change amid the era's tensions.

## Fun Facts
- The studio recording of 'They Say I Look Like God' was completed in one take, leaving everyone in the studio crying due to Armstrong's emotional delivery[1].
- At the 1962 Monterey live show, Lambert, Hendricks & Ross wore sackcloths and hoods (lifted before singing) to symbolize racial prejudice during 'They Say I Look Like God'[1].
- Brubeck regretted not paying the $750 fee to film the Monterey performance, calling it a 'terrible goof'[1].
- The musical was inspired by State Department tours, critiquing U.S. promotion of jazz abroad while ignoring domestic racism[1][2].
