## Biography
Brittany Howard, born October 2, 1988, in Athens, Alabama, is an acclaimed American musician, singer, and songwriter best known as the lead vocalist, guitarist, and principal songwriter for the Grammy-winning band Alabama Shakes. Raised in a working-class family, Howard faced significant adversity early in life, including the loss of her older sister Jaime to cancer and her own battle with partial blindness caused by the same illness. Inspired by her sister, she began writing poetry and playing piano before picking up the guitar at age 13. Her musical journey accelerated in high school, where she met bassist Zac Cockrell, leading to the formation of Alabama Shakes. 

Alabama Shakes quickly rose to prominence with their 2012 debut album 'Boys & Girls,' which blended blues, rock, and soul influences and earned critical and commercial success. Their follow-up, 'Sound & Color' (2015), debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and solidified their status as one of the decade’s most vital rock bands. Howard’s dynamic stage presence and powerful vocals drew widespread acclaim, and the band won four Grammy Awards. After Alabama Shakes went on hiatus in 2018, Howard launched a successful solo career, releasing the genre-defying album 'Jaime' in 2019, which garnered seven Grammy nominations and won Best Rock Song for 'Stay High.' Her second solo album, 'What Now,' was released in 2024, further showcasing her versatility and creative evolution.

Howard’s musical style is rooted in Southern rock, blues, and soul, but her solo work explores funk, R&B, and experimental sounds, reflecting a fearless approach to genre and identity. She has also led side projects such as Thunderbitch and Bermuda Triangle, and her influence as a trailblazing Black woman in rock has inspired a new generation of artists. Howard’s legacy is marked by her resilience, innovation, and commitment to authentic self-expression.
