## Biography
Richard Arnold Holmes, known professionally as "Groove" Holmes, was born on May 2, 1931, in Camden, New Jersey. Originally a bass player, Holmes made the unconventional switch to the Hammond B-3 organ without any formal piano training, developing a completely self-taught style that would become his trademark. His infectious approach featured remarkably strong bass lines underpinning each tune, with a sound immediately recognizable in the upper register and, more notably, through his virtuosity in creating the most rapid, punctuating, and pulsating bass lines of all jazz organists. Standing at approximately 300 pounds, Holmes was literally a heavyweight presence whose physical stature matched his commanding musical personality.

Holmes' career breakthrough came in 1960 when Les McCann discovered him playing in small clubs around Pittsburgh and New Jersey, bringing him to California to perform in the vibrant Los Angeles entertainment scene. He signed with Pacific Jazz in the early 1960s, with his first album recorded in March 1961 featuring the legendary Ben Webster. Holmes gained national attention through recordings with tenor saxophone greats like Ben Webster and Gene Ammons, establishing himself as a revered figure in soul-jazz circles. His 1965 recording of "Misty" for Prestige Records became a jukebox hit that truly put him on the map, with its Charleston-inflected beat transforming Erroll Garner's ballad into Holmes' signature sound. Throughout the 1960s and early 1970s, he engaged in inspired organ battles with Jimmy McGriff before experimenting with electric keyboards and fusion material in the mid-1970s.

Holmes was an unapologetically swinging player who could effortlessly move from the grittiest blues to the most sentimental ballads, making him especially popular within the Black community and well-respected on the Philadelphia/Southern New Jersey circuit. He returned to his organ priorities in the mid-to-late 1980s, recording high-quality soul-jazz for Muse Records, often featuring tenor saxophonist Houston Person. Despite battling prostate cancer, Holmes remained a musician to the end, performing his final concerts in a wheelchair, including his last gig at the 1991 Chicago Blues Festival with longtime friend Jimmy Witherspoon. He died on June 29, 1991, in St. Louis, Missouri, at the age of 60, leaving behind a legacy as a giant among the generation of jazz organists who brought the Hammond B-3 sound to artistic prominence and popular appeal.
