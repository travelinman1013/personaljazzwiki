## Biography
Marisa Anderson is an American guitarist and composer renowned for her innovative approach to the guitar, blending elements of American folk, blues, country, and experimental music. Born in the United States, Anderson is classically trained but developed her distinctive style through years of playing in country, jazz, and circus bands. Her early life was marked by a spirit of adventure—she dropped out of college at nineteen to walk across the United States, a journey that fueled her creative curiosity and led to fifteen years of travel, during which she lived in cars, tents, and buses, and even traveled to Mexico with a circus. This peripatetic lifestyle deeply influenced her music, infusing it with a sense of wanderlust and a reverence for traditional American musical forms.[3][1]

Settling in Portland, Oregon in the late 1990s, Anderson became a fixture in the local music scene, playing with bands such as the Dolly Ranchers and the Evolutionary Jass Band before embarking on a solo career in 2009. Her solo work is characterized by fluid, emotional, and masterful guitar playing that channels the history of the instrument while stretching the boundaries of tradition. Anderson's compositions and improvisations often draw on Delta blues, West African guitar, Appalachian mountain music, gospel, and minimalism, reimagining the landscape of American music. She is also known for her innovative use of recording techniques, often serving as her own engineer and developing pieces through improvisation and experimentation.[2][3]

Anderson's legacy is marked by critical acclaim and a growing influence on contemporary guitar music. She has released numerous solo albums and collaborative projects, including works with Jim White and William Tyler, and her music has been featured in major publications such as Rolling Stone, NPR, The New York Times, and Pitchfork. Her performances at international festivals and collaborations with a diverse array of artists underscore her status as one of the most distinctive and powerful guitarists of her generation.[1][4]
