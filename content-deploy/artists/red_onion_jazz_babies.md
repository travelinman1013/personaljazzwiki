## Biography
The Red Onion Jazz Babies was an early supergroup of the Jazz Age, organized by music entrepreneur Clarence Williams in 1924. The ensemble featured some of the most innovative and influential jazz musicians of the era, including cornetist Louis Armstrong, soprano saxophonist and clarinetist Sidney Bechet, pianist Lil Hardin-Armstrong (who had relocated east to be near her husband Louis), trombonist Charlie Irvis, banjoist Buddy Christian, and vocalists Alberta Hunter and Clarence Todd. The group recorded their most notable session on December 22, 1924, producing the classic track "Cake Walking Babies From Town," which showcased the ensemble's ability to blend hot jazz improvisation with structured arrangements. The Red Onion Jazz Babies represented a crucial moment in early jazz history when New Orleans musicians and styles were beginning to spread across America, establishing New York as a major jazz center alongside Chicago.

The musical style of the Red Onion Jazz Babies embodied the vibrant energy of the Jazz Age, combining the blues-inflected improvisation of New Orleans tradition with the sophistication of trained musicians like Bechet and Armstrong. Their recordings demonstrated the power of collective improvisation while maintaining melodic coherence, with Armstrong and Bechet trading solos over the rhythm section's steady support. Though the group's recording career was relatively brief, their impact on jazz history was substantial, as they helped establish the template for small ensemble jazz recording and performance that would influence generations of musicians. The Red Onion Jazz Babies' legacy endures as a testament to the collaborative spirit of early jazz and the transformative power of bringing together exceptional individual talents.
