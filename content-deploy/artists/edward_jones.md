## Biography
Edward Jones (March 1752 – 18 April 1824), widely known by his bardic name Bardd y Brenin ('The King's Bard'), was a prominent Welsh harpist, composer, arranger, and collector of traditional music. Born in Henblas, Llandderfel, Meironnydd, Wales, into a musically gifted family, Jones was taught music from an early age by his father, a skilled harpist and instrument maker. His early fascination with Welsh poetry and native customs shaped his lifelong dedication to preserving and celebrating Welsh musical heritage.

In 1775, Jones moved to London under the patronage of Welsh nobility, quickly establishing himself as a leading harpist and teacher among the British elite. He performed in the influential Bach-Abel concerts and became harp tutor to several aristocratic families. Around 1790, he was appointed Harp-Master to the Prince of Wales, later King George IV, and adopted the bardic title Bardd y Brenin. Jones published over twenty volumes of music, most notably the three-volume 'Musical and Poetical Relicks of the Welsh Bards,' which remains a foundational work in the preservation of Welsh folk music and poetry. He also played a significant role in eisteddfodau (Welsh festivals of literature, music, and performance), serving as adjudicator and awarding medals to outstanding performers.

Despite his artistic achievements and royal patronage, Jones faced financial hardship in his later years, ultimately selling much of his valuable collection. He died in relative obscurity in 1824, but his legacy endures as a pivotal figure in the Celtic Revival and the safeguarding of Welsh musical traditions.
