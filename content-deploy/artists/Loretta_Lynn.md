## Biography
Loretta Lynn, born Loretta Webb on April 14, 1932, in Butcher Hollow, Kentucky, was the eldest daughter of a coal miner and subsistence farmer.  Her early life was shaped by poverty and the hardships of Appalachian life, experiences that profoundly influenced her songwriting.  She began singing in local clubs in the late 1950s, forming her own band, the Trailblazers, which included her brother Jay Lee Webb.  A televised talent contest win, viewed by representatives of Zero Records, led to her first recording contract in 1960.  Patsy Cline served as a mentor and best friend during Lynn's early career.

Lynn's career blossomed after signing with Decca Records.  Collaborations with Ernest Tubb resulted in several duet albums.  Her songwriting prowess propelled her to the top of the country music charts, with hits like "You Ain't Woman Enough (To Take My Man)," her first self-penned No. 1 hit, and "Don't Come Home A-Drinkin' (With Lovin' on Your Mind)."  Her partnership with Conway Twitty yielded five consecutive No. 1 hits and numerous awards as a duo.  Lynn's autobiographical hit "Coal Miner's Daughter" became a No. 1 country single and the title of her bestselling autobiography and an Oscar-winning film starring Sissy Spacek.  Later collaborations included a Grammy-winning album, *Van Lear Rose*, produced by Jack White, and the *Honky Tonk Angels* album with Dolly Parton and Tammy Wynette.

Lynn's musical style was characterized by her honest and unflinching portrayal of women's lives, often tackling controversial subjects considered taboo in country music at the time.  She fearlessly sang about birth control ("The Pill"), the realities of motherhood ("One's on the Way"), and the double standards faced by women ("Rated 'X'").  This outspokenness, combined with her powerful vocals and relatable storytelling, established her as a groundbreaking figure in country music.  Her legacy extends beyond her numerous awards and chart-topping hits; she is remembered for her authentic voice, her advocacy for working-class women, and her enduring influence on generations of female country artists.  She was the most awarded female country recording artist and the only female ACM Artist of the Decade (1970s).
