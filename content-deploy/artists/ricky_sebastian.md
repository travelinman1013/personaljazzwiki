## Biography
Ricky Sebastian is an American jazz and fusion drummer and educator from southwest Louisiana, widely regarded for his fluency across New Orleans R&B, Afro‑Cuban, Brazilian, funk, rock, Cajun, zydeco, and straight‑ahead jazz styles.[1][3][7] Born in Opelousas, Louisiana, and raised in a Cajun family, he was surrounded early on by Cajun music, soul, R&B, rock, and New Orleans rhythms, and began playing drums as a child, starting formal snare drum lessons around age eight.[1][2][3][4][8] He studied classical percussion through junior and senior high school, winning multiple All‑State and sight‑reading awards, and later took up piano at seventeen while in college.[1] Sebastian attended the University of Southwestern Louisiana (now University of Louisiana at Lafayette) on a full scholarship, focusing on classical theory, composition, and drums, then continued his studies at Berklee College of Music in Boston on a partial scholarship, concentrating on drums, arranging, and jazz harmony.[1][6][8]

Sebastian’s professional career began unusually early when, at sixteen, he was hired as a drummer for the Emmet Kelly Circus, touring the U.S. and Mexico and performing nightly shows that honed his time, focus, and adaptability in demanding conditions.[2] In 1976 he returned to New Orleans and quickly became an in‑demand drummer across the city’s diverse musical scenes, gaining intensive experience in jazz, Afro‑Cuban, carnival music, Brazilian, reggae, calypso, funk, rock, R&B, Cajun, and zydeco over the following six years.[1] Seeking to work alongside his musical heroes, he moved to New York City in 1983, where over roughly 18 years he built a career as a recording and touring sideman with a “who’s who” of jazz, Latin, Brazilian, and fusion artists, appearing on hundreds of recordings and performing at major jazz festivals around the world.[1][3] Returning to New Orleans in the late 1990s, Sebastian shifted his primary focus to education while continuing to perform, becoming head percussion instructor at the University of New Orleans under Ellis Marsalis, teaching at the Drummers Collective and The New School in New York, and leading the World Music Ensemble and UNO Percussion Ensemble, for which he composes much of the repertoire.[1][2][3]

As a bandleader, Sebastian released his first album, “The Spirit Within,” in 2001 on STR Digital Records, featuring prominent collaborators such as Donald Harrison Jr., Bill Summers, Steve Masakowski, Randy Brecker, and Peter Martin, highlighting his modern jazz‑fusion approach informed by New Orleans grooves and global rhythms.[1][6] He is also the author of the drum‑set method book “Independence on the Drum Set,” published by Hal Leonard (mid‑2000s), which has further cemented his reputation as a leading drum educator and clinician for major instrument manufacturers including Zildjian, Pearl, LP, Remo, Audix, and Pro‑Mark.[1][3] Beyond his technical command and stylistic breadth, Sebastian’s legacy rests in his dual role as a world‑traveling performer—having toured the globe multiple times—and as a mentor who has trained thousands of students, many of whom populate New Orleans’ jazz and world‑music scenes, reflecting his belief in rigorous musicianship, versatility, and the importance of transmitting tradition through hands‑on ensemble experience.[1][2][3][8]

## Fun Facts
- Sebastian’s first major professional job was as a circus drummer at age sixteen with the Emmet Kelly Circus, where he had to crash the cymbal every time a troupe of twenty dogs jumped over barricades, regardless of the beat, a challenge he credits with sharpening his focus and time feel.[2]
- His early touring with the circus took him to Mexico, where he often performed in bullrings and shows with highly trained horses for audiences that did not speak English, giving him his first experience of international touring and nightly professional gigs.[2]
- Sebastian has toured the world four times and recorded on hundreds of CDs, making him a quietly ubiquitous presence behind many jazz, Latin, and fusion recordings rather than a household name.[1][3]
- In addition to drumming, he began studying piano at seventeen, which informed his understanding of harmony and composition and later helped him write music for his ensembles at the University of New Orleans.[1]
