# Malo

## Quick Info
- **Genres**: afropop, afro soul, maskandi
- **Spotify Popularity**: 50/100
- **Followers**: 700,353
- **Origin**: San Francisco

## Biography
Public, verifiable biographical information specifically matching an Afropop / Afro soul / maskandi artist named “Malo” is extremely sparse in credible, English‑language music databases and media coverage. The best‑documented artists and groups using the name “Malo” are a 1970s U.S. Latin‑rock band led by Arcelio Garcia and Jorge Santana, a Danish‑born pop singer‑songwriter, a South African electronic/deep house producer called Griffith Malo, and a synthwave artist, none of whom match the Afropop / maskandi genre profile given in your Spotify context.[2][4][6][8] Because of this name overlap and the lack of dedicated profiles or interviews clearly tied to an Afropop / afro soul / maskandi artist billed simply as “Malo,” it is not currently possible to write a reliable, detailed biography (early life, career development, and legacy) for the specific artist you are asking about without guessing or conflating them with other unrelated acts.

In music‑industry research, it is crucial not to assume that artists sharing a name are the same person or group, especially when genres, locations, and collaborators differ.[8] In this case, the documented Malo band is a San Francisco Latin‑rock ensemble with horn sections and a 1970s heritage; the Danish MALO is a pop singer; and Griffith Malo is a South African electronic/deep house musician, all of which clearly diverge from the Afropop / maskandi description you provided.[2][4][6][7] Without clear, corroborated biographical sources for an Afropop / afro soul / maskandi artist specifically named “Malo,” any further narrative about early life, training, or stylistic evolution would be speculative rather than factual.

Given these constraints, the only accurate statement about the Afropop / maskandi “Malo” that can be made from your context is that Spotify (and possibly other platforms) classify this artist’s work under afropop, afro soul, and maskandi, and list a mid‑range popularity score, but do not provide externally verifiable biographical details beyond that genre tagging and basic streaming metadata.

## Fun Facts
- Multiple unrelated artists and groups are active under the name “Malo,” including a 1970s San Francisco Latin‑rock band, a Danish‑born pop artist, a South African deep‑house producer (Griffith Malo), and at least one synthwave project.[2][4][6][8]
- The best‑known act using the name is the Latin‑rock band Malo, whose members previously played in groups like The Malibus and Naked Lunch and who became popular across Central and South America in the 1970s.[6][8]
- Because of the name collision, streaming and chart data for “Malo” can easily be misattributed across different artists, which is why genre tags (like Afropop or maskandi) are an important clue for distinguishing them on platforms such as Spotify.[8]
