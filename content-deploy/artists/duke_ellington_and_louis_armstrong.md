## Biography
Duke Ellington and Louis Armstrong stand as two of the most consequential figures in the history of jazz, emerging from very different beginnings to reshape 20th‑century music. Edward Kennedy “Duke” Ellington, born in Washington, D.C., in 1899 to a middle‑class Black family, was groomed in decorum and artistry, earning his nickname for his elegant bearing. He moved to New York in the 1920s, forged his identity leading the Washingtonians and later his own orchestra, and became synonymous with Harlem’s Cotton Club, where his sophisticated arrangements blended blues, ragtime, popular song, and extended composition into a new orchestral jazz language.[2] Louis Daniel Armstrong, by contrast, was born in 1901 in the rough New Orleans neighborhood known as “The Battlefield,” where poverty and street life marked his childhood.[3] After a stint in the Colored Waif’s Home—where he first seriously studied cornet—he took the raw energy of New Orleans brass bands and riverboat ensembles and turned it into a personal, virtuosic style that revolutionized solo improvisation and jazz phrasing.[3]

By the mid‑1920s, Armstrong’s groundbreaking Hot Five and Hot Seven recordings redefined the role of the soloist, his trumpet lines and vocal phrasing setting the template for modern jazz and popular singing.[2] Ellington, during the same era, was expanding jazz beyond dance‑band conventions, composing works such as “Black and Tan Fantasy” that fused blues feeling with advanced harmony and form, and tailoring parts to the distinctive voices in his orchestra.[1][2] Armstrong’s direct, swinging attack influenced not only trumpeters in Ellington’s band—like Cootie Williams and Ray Nance—but also key Ellingtonians such as trombonist Lawrence Brown and alto saxophonist Johnny Hodges, who credited Armstrong with their rhythmic and phrasing approaches.[1] Ellington, in turn, would later honor Armstrong in his “New Orleans Suite” with the movement “Portrait of Louis Armstrong,” acknowledging the trumpeter as “the epitome of jazz.”[1]

Although their careers largely ran on parallel tracks—Armstrong as the archetypal jazz soloist and international entertainer, Ellington as the foremost composer‑bandleader—they intersected memorably in the studio and on screen. After years of mutual admiration, they finally recorded together in 1961 for Roulette Records on a project often issued as “The Great Summit,” a relaxed yet focused meeting that showcased Armstrong’s singing and trumpet against Ellington’s piano and small‑group arrangements.[1] They had appeared earlier in the 1961 film “Paris Blues,” with Armstrong portraying Wild Man Moore and performing Ellington compositions like “Battle Royal” and “Wild Man.”[1] By this time, both men were elder statesmen of jazz, their legacies extending well beyond music into broader cultural impact: they broke racial barriers on stage and in film, became symbols of Black excellence and resilience, and helped open mainstream American and global audiences to the depth and dignity of African American art.[3][4][6]

## Fun Facts
- Ellington and Armstrong—despite being the two most famous names in jazz—made only one full studio album together, recorded for Roulette Records in 1961 and often issued under the title “The Great Summit.”[1]
- At the 1961 sessions, observers noted that Armstrong instantly grasped Ellington’s arrangements and, on several tunes, knew the Ellington routines better than Barney Bigard, the clarinetist who had spent fifteen years in Duke’s band before joining Armstrong.[1]
- Ellington’s late‑career “New Orleans Suite” includes a movement titled “Portrait of Louis Armstrong,” a musical tribute that underlines the deep mutual respect between the two men.[1]
- In his autobiography “Music Is My Mistress,” Ellington described Armstrong as “the epitome of jazz” and portrayed him as both an artistic and financial success, highlighting the way Armstrong’s manager Joe Glaser ensured the trumpeter’s long‑term security.[1]

- [[johnny_hodges_cootie_williams_ray_nance_lawrence_brown|Johnny Hodges, Cootie Williams, Ray Nance, Lawrence Brown]] - Key Ellington sidemen whose playing both inspired Ellington’s writing and was itself shaped by Armstrong’s influence on phrasing and rhythm.[1] (Classic Ellington recordings featuring these soloists throughout the 1930s–1950s; Armstrong’s influence is explicitly noted on Hodges and others.[1]) [1930s–1960s]
- [[billy_strayhorn|Billy Strayhorn]] - Ellington’s closest compositional partner, co‑creating many extended works and suites.[4] (Collaborations on multiple suites and large‑scale compositions for the Ellington band (e.g., later suites cited in Ellington biographies).) [Late 1930s–1960s]
- [[louis_armstrong_and_duke_ellington_together|Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington (together)]] - Two jazz giants brought together for a rare studio collaboration and film appearances.

### Artists Influenced
- [[cootie_williams_freddy_jenkins_ray_nance|Cootie Williams, Freddy Jenkins, Ray Nance]] - Ellington trumpeters whose approach reflects Armstrong’s model of jazz trumpet sound and improvisation.[1] (Ellington orchestra recordings from the late 1920s onward where their solos show Armstrong‑derived phrasing and tone.[1]) [Late 1920s–1950s]

- [[johnny_hodges|Johnny Hodges]] - Ellington’s star alto saxophonist, widely regarded as one of the greatest “Ellingtonians,” who drew on Armstrong’s rhythmic conception and phrasing.[1] (Numerous Ellington recordings spotlighting Hodges; his style is noted as reflecting Armstrong’s influence.[1]) [1930s–1960s]
- [[later_generations_of_jazz_bandleaders_and_soloists|Later generations of jazz bandleaders and soloists]] - Armstrong’s central role as the defining jazz soloist and Ellington’s as the pre‑eminent composer created the basic templates for modern jazz performance and orchestration.[2][3][6] (Countless later jazz works in big band, small‑group, and vocal jazz styles that build on their models of improvisation and composition.) [1930s onward]
