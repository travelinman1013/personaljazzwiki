## Biography
Outkast is a pioneering hip hop duo formed in 1992 in East Point, Georgia, consisting of André '3000' Benjamin and Antwan 'Big Boi' Patton. Both artists grew up in the Atlanta area—Benjamin in Decatur and Patton in Savannah—before meeting as high school students. Their early career was shaped by the Atlanta-based production team Organized Noize, who mentored them and helped them secure a deal with LaFace Records at age seventeen. Outkast’s debut single, 'Player’s Ball,' released in 1993, quickly rose to the top of the Billboard rap charts, signaling the arrival of a new Southern voice in hip hop.

Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, Outkast released a string of critically acclaimed and commercially successful albums, including 'Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik' (1994), 'ATLiens' (1996), 'Aquemini' (1998), and the genre-defying 'Stankonia' (2000). Their music is known for its intricate lyricism, innovative production, and fusion of diverse genres such as funk, psychedelia, jazz, and techno. The duo’s 2003 double album, 'Speakerboxxx/The Love Below,' showcased their individual artistic identities and produced the global hit 'Hey Ya!,' earning them three Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year. Outkast’s willingness to experiment and push boundaries helped redefine Southern hip hop and brought Atlanta to the forefront of the genre.

Outkast’s legacy is marked by their role in popularizing Southern hip hop and influencing a generation of artists with their originality and genre-blending sound. They are widely regarded as one of the most influential hip hop acts of all time, known for their creative vision, positive messages, and lasting impact on both hip hop and popular music at large.
