## Biography
The Boneshakers is an iconic blues, funk, and rock band led by world-renowned guitarist Randy Jacobs, originally from Detroit where he was raised after being born in San Francisco. Jacobs began his professional career young, collaborating with Motown writers and producers by age 13 and co-authoring the Top-Five R&B hit 'Wide Receiver.' In 1980, he met vocalist Sweetpea Atkinson during a session for Was (Not Was), forging a bond that propelled the band to success with hits like 'Walk The Dinosaur.' After Was (Not Was) went on hiatus in 1992, Jacobs worked with artists like Bonnie Raitt, BB King, and Seal, while Atkinson contributed vocals to Neil Diamond and others. Reuniting in the mid-1990s, they formed The Boneshakers—named by Bonnie Raitt during sessions for her 'Longing In Our Hearts' album—blending Detroit soul with Muscle Shoals-style R&B.[1][2]

Signed to Pointblank/Virgin Records in 1996, The Boneshakers released 'Book Of Spells' (1997) featuring a swing arrangement of James Brown's 'Cold Sweat,' and 'Shake The Planet' (1998). When Atkinson toured with Lyle Lovett, the band enlisted singer Malford Milligan for 'Pouring Gasoline' (2001) and live album 'Put Some Booty On It, Vol. 1' (2002). Atkinson rejoined for 'Put Some Booty On It, Vol. 2' (2006). The band collaborated with saxophonist Mindi Abair, releasing 'Live in Seattle' (2017) on Concord Records, winning 8 Independent Blues Awards in 2018 including Artist of the Year, and the 2019 LA Critics Award for Best Holiday Album. Tragedy struck in 2020 with Atkinson's passing.[1][2]

The legacy continued in 2022 when producer John Wooler connected Jacobs with vocalist Jenny Langer, a Virginia Blues Hall of Fame inductee at age 28 and 2020 International Blues Challenge winner for Best Self-Produced Album with Moonshine Society. Their collaboration produced 'One Foot In The Groove,' earning Wammie Awards. In 2025, Gulf Coast Records released their 11th album 'Live To Be This' on July 18, debuting in Billboard's Top 10 and featured in Rolling Stone, showcasing funk, blues, and rock with guest appearances.[1][2][3]
