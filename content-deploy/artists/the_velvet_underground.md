## Biography
The Velvet Underground was formed in New York City in 1964, emerging from the creative partnership between Lou Reed, a songwriter and guitarist from Long Island, and John Cale, a Welsh multi-instrumentalist with a background in avant-garde classical music[3][8]. Reed and Cale bonded over their shared interest in experimental sounds and urban realism, soon recruiting guitarist Sterling Morrison, Reed's college classmate, and percussionist Angus MacLise. After several name changes, they settled on 'The Velvet Underground,' inspired by a book about secret sexual subcultures[3]. Moe Tucker later replaced MacLise, solidifying the classic lineup[5].

The band quickly became known for their raw, confrontational style, blending rock with avant-garde influences such as drones, distortion, and atonal feedback[1][3]. Their lyrics explored taboo subjects like drug use and sadomasochism, setting them apart from the prevailing psychedelic optimism of the late 1960s. In 1966, pop artist Andy Warhol became their manager, introducing them to German singer Nico and featuring them as the house band for his multimedia show, the Exploding Plastic Inevitable[1][3]. Their debut album, 'The Velvet Underground & Nico,' initially met with critical indifference and poor sales, but is now considered one of the most influential albums in rock history[3].

Despite internal conflicts and commercial struggles, the Velvet Underground released several groundbreaking albums, including 'White Light/White Heat,' 'The Velvet Underground,' and 'Loaded.' Their innovative fusion of art rock, proto-punk, and urban storytelling profoundly shaped the development of punk, new wave, and alternative music. Though their initial run ended in the early 1970s, their legacy endures, with countless artists citing them as a primary influence[3][2].
