## Biography
The Onward Brass Band is a legendary New Orleans brass ensemble whose origins trace back to the late 19th century, with the earliest references appearing in 1887. The band quickly became a central figure in New Orleans’ musical life, earning a reputation as the city’s top marching band by the time of the Spanish–American War. Under the leadership of cornetist Manuel Perez from 1903 until its disbandment in 1930, the original Onward Brass Band included many musicians who would become foundational to the development of jazz, such as Lorenzo Tio Jr., Peter Bocage, George Baquet, Isidore Barbarin, and King Oliver. The band was known for its powerful brass sound, blending European military band traditions with African American musical practices, and was a staple at parades, funerals, and social events, helping to shape the distinctive New Orleans brass band tradition.[1][2][8]

After a period of inactivity following the Great Depression, the Onward Brass Band was revived in 1960 by drummer Paul Barbarin, son of original member Isidore Barbarin, alongside clarinetist Louis Cottrell Jr. and banjoist Danny Barker. This second generation of Onward Brass Band maintained the spirit and repertoire of its predecessor, performing at major events such as the 1964 World’s Fair, Super Bowl IV, and the inaugural New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival. The band became a fixture in the city’s cultural life, especially during Mardi Gras, and continued to record and perform under various leaders, including Louis Cottrell Jr. and Placide Adams, well into the late 20th century. The Onward Brass Band’s enduring presence and influence have made it a cornerstone of New Orleans’ musical heritage, celebrated for its role in both preserving and advancing the brass band tradition.[1][2][8]
