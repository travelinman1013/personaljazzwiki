## Biography
Richard M. Jones, born Richard Marigny Jones on June 13, 1892, in Donaldsonville, Louisiana, was a pioneering American jazz pianist, composer, band leader, and record producer. Raised in New Orleans in a musical family, Jones initially played alto horn in brass bands before switching to piano, which became his primary instrument. By 1908, he was performing in Storyville, the famed red-light district of New Orleans, and soon began leading his own bands, collaborating with notable local musicians such as Joe "King" Oliver, John Robichaux, Armand J. Piron, and Papa Celestin.[3][4]

In 1918, Jones relocated to Chicago, a major center for jazz during the Great Migration. There, he managed the Chicago branch of Clarence Williams' publishing company and became a key figure in the city's jazz scene. Jones began recording in 1923, both as a solo pianist and with his bands, most notably The Jazz Wizards and The Chicago Cosmopolitans. He recorded for several major labels, including Gennett, OKeh, Victor, and Paramount, and served as the Chicago supervisor for OKeh Records' "Race" (African-American) Records division, where he produced influential sessions such as Louis Armstrong's Hot Five and Hot Seven recordings.[3][4][2]

Jones' musical style blended ragtime, blues, and early jazz, characterized by expressive piano playing and innovative band arrangements. He continued his work as a musician, producer, and talent scout throughout the 1930s, holding management roles at Decca and Mercury Records until his death in Chicago on December 8, 1945. His legacy endures through compositions like "Trouble in Mind" and "Riverside Blues," and his impact as a mentor and producer helped shape the development of jazz in both New Orleans and Chicago.[3][2][4]
