## Biography
Benjamin Bernard Selvin (March 5, 1898 – July 15, 1980) was an American musician, bandleader, and record producer who became known as the Dean of Recorded Music. Born in New York City to Jewish Russian immigrant parents, Selvin began playing violin before age seven and initially studied to become a concert violinist. He launched his professional career at age 15 as a fiddle player in New York City nightclubs, and by age 21, he had organized his own orchestra, the Novelty Orchestra, which performed at the Moulin Rouge for an impressive seven-year run on Broadway. His early success included recording what became the biggest-selling popular song in the first quarter-century of recorded music—"Dardanella"—which sold over six million copies and earned him an RIAA gold disc upon his retirement in 1963.

Selvin's career was defined by his extraordinary prolific output and innovative approach to recording. According to The Guinness Book of World Records, he recorded more musical sides on 78-rpm discs than any other person, with estimates ranging from 9,000 to 20,000 different song titles recorded between 1919 and 1966. To achieve this volume, he recorded for dozens of different record labels simultaneously, using various pseudonyms including the Knickerbockers, Cavaliers, Bar Harbor Society Orchestra, Kentucky Serenaders, and the Harmonians. From 1927 to 1934, he served as Artists and Repertoire (A&R) director for Columbia Records, where he produced recordings for major artists including Benny Goodman, Tommy Dorsey, Jimmy Dorsey, Joe Venuti, Eddie Lang, and Bunny Berigan. His influence extended beyond recording; he played a founding role in Muzak during the 1930s, served as Vice President of programming at Muzak in New York City in 1934, and helped establish the Columbia Broadcasting System as their Program and Music Director.

Throughout his later career, Selvin continued to shape the music industry in various capacities. He was musical director of Majestic Records beginning in 1947 and later served as A&R director at RCA Victor, where he oversaw popular recordings by Frank Sinatra, Doris Day, Dinah Shore, and Buddy Clark in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Known for his ability to write orchestral arrangements rapidly and oversee multiple recording sessions simultaneously, Selvin was a central figure in developing pre-recorded music programming for radio stations through the World Broadcasting System. After his retirement from RCA at age 65 in the early 1960s, he became a consultant to 3M, assisting with the transition from vinyl records to audio cassettes, and served as a musical consultant to the Top of the Fair venue at the 1964 New York World's Fair.

## Fun Facts
- Selvin recorded the same song up to six different times with six different arrangers and arrangements, sometimes recording every day of the week to fulfill his prolific output demands.
- He used so many pseudonyms and band names across different record labels that his true recording output was obscured for decades—estimates range from 9,000 to 20,000 different titles, making it difficult to determine his exact discography.
- His signature hit "Dardanella" sold over six million copies plus an additional million pieces of sheet music, making it the biggest-selling popular song in the first quarter-century of recorded music.
- Selvin was known for his remarkable ability to write orchestral arrangements with extraordinary speed and to oversee multiple recording sessions simultaneously, making him invaluable to record companies seeking high-volume production.
