## Biography
Yusef Lateef, born William Emanuel Huddleston on October 9, 1920, in Chattanooga, Tennessee, was a pioneering American multi-instrumentalist, composer, and educator whose career spanned more than seven decades. Moving to Detroit as a child, Lateef was immersed in a vibrant musical community and began touring professionally by age 18 with leading swing bands. In 1949, he joined the Dizzy Gillespie Orchestra, marking a turning point in his career and his conversion to Islam, after which he adopted the name Yusef Lateef.

Lateef became renowned for his mastery of the tenor saxophone and flute, but he was equally celebrated for introducing a wide array of non-Western instruments—such as the bamboo flute, shanai, and argol—into jazz. His innovative approach fused hard bop with modal, free, and avant-garde jazz, and he was one of the earliest artists to incorporate Middle Eastern, Asian, and African musical elements, helping to pioneer what would later be called 'world music.' Notable albums like 'Eastern Sounds' (1961) exemplified his global vision, blending jazz with Eastern scales and instruments. Lateef was also a respected educator, earning a doctorate in education and teaching at institutions including the University of Massachusetts Amherst. He continued to record, perform, and compose into his 90s, leaving a profound legacy as a spiritual and musical innovator.
