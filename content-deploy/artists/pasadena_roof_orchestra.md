## Biography
The Pasadena Roof Orchestra (PRO) is a contemporary British swing and jazz ensemble that was founded in 1969 by John Arthy, a professional baker from Wanstead who played double bass and sousaphone.[1][5] The orchestra's formation was catalyzed by a remarkable discovery: Arthy purchased over 1,000 original musical arrangements from the 1920s and 1930s that had been stored in the attic of a lady in Manchester for decades, which he acquired for £40 in the summer of 1969.[5] The first rehearsal took place on November 3rd, 1969, at Arthy's family's disused underground bakery in Forest Gate, East London, and the band's name was inspired by Harry Warren's composition "(Home in) Pasadena."[2][3][5] Rather than following the humorous approach of the contemporary Trad revival movement, Arthy deliberately steered the orchestra toward serious, dedicated renditions of 1920s and 1930s swing and hot dance music, establishing them as one of the most authentic and stylistically reliable ensembles in the genre.[1][2]

The orchestra achieved rapid success, becoming professional in 1975 and recording their first LP for Transatlantic Records in August 1974, which premiered at the Midem music fair in Cannes in 1975.[1][2] Their reception in Germany was extraordinary—performances at venues like "Onkel Pö's Carnegie Hall" in Hamburg in 1975 were compared to the Beatles, and they subsequently headlined the Montreux Jazz Festival.[2] The band expanded their international reach with tours of the United States in 1993 and 2001, performing across major cities from Seattle to Los Angeles and notably at the Ambassador Theatre in Pasadena, California.[1][2] Throughout their career, they have collaborated with prominent artists including Bryan Ferry (2000) and Robbie Williams (2005).[1] Although founder John Arthy retired in 1997, the orchestra has continued to flourish under the leadership of bandleader and vocalist Duncan Galloway, maintaining an extensive touring and recording schedule across Britain, Germany, and venues worldwide including Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur, and Dubai.[1][2]

The Pasadena Roof Orchestra represents a significant contribution to the preservation and celebration of swing music, demonstrating that the genre's appeal transcends decades and geographical boundaries. Their commitment to authenticity and musical excellence has established them as ambassadors of 1920s and 1930s dance band music for contemporary audiences, proving that swing remains a vital and engaging musical form capable of captivating audiences in prestigious concert halls and intimate venues alike.

## Fun Facts
- John Arthy discovered over 1,000 original dance band arrangements from the 1920s and 1930s in a Manchester attic and purchased them for just £40 in the summer of 1969, which became the foundation of the orchestra's repertoire.[5]
- The orchestra's reception at 'Onkel Pö's Carnegie Hall' in Hamburg in 1975 was so extraordinary that it was compared to the Beatles' level of popularity.[2]
- The band's 25th Anniversary album cover featured a photograph of the orchestra in front of the Ambassador Theatre in Pasadena, California, connecting them visually to the city that inspired their name.[1]
- John Arthy, the founder, was a professional baker by trade who discovered his passion for 1920s and 1930s dance band music and successfully convinced Transatlantic Records to keep the name 'Pasadena Roof Orchestra' despite the label's initial desire to change it.[5]
