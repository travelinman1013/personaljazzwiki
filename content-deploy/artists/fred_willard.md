## Biography
Fred Willard, born Frederic Charles Willard on September 18, 1933, in Shaker Heights, Ohio, began his career in the late 1950s after moving to New York, where he performed in a local YMCA production of Desperate Hours and partnered with Vic Grecco to form the comedy duo Willard & Grecco. They toured, appeared on shows like The Dean Martin Show and The Tonight Show, but parted in 1968 due to management issues. Willard then worked at The Second City in Chicago with performers like Robert Klein and David Steinberg, became a founding member of the improvisational group Ace Trucking Company alongside Michael Mislove and Bill Saluga, and debuted in film with Teenage Mother (1967).[2][1][5]
