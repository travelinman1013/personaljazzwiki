## Biography
Coleman Hawkins (1904–1969), known as "Hawk" or "Bean," was a pioneering American jazz tenor saxophonist who is widely credited with establishing the tenor saxophone as a prominent solo instrument in jazz. Born in Saint Joseph, Missouri, Hawkins began playing piano and cello before switching to saxophone at age nine. By the early 1920s, he was performing with Mamie Smith's Jazz Hounds and soon joined Fletcher Henderson's orchestra in New York, where his robust, innovative style helped define the sound of big band swing. Hawkins's 1939 recording of "Body and Soul" is considered a landmark in jazz improvisation and remains one of the genre's most celebrated performances[5][7].

Clark Terry (1920–2015), born in St. Louis, Missouri, was a world-class trumpeter, flugelhornist, composer, educator, and NEA Jazz Master whose career spanned more than seventy years. After serving in the Navy during World War II, Terry rose to prominence in the bands of George Hudson, Charlie Barnet, and Count Basie, before joining Duke Ellington's orchestra in 1951, where he stayed for eight years as a featured soloist. Terry broke barriers as the first African American staff musician at NBC, performing for twelve years in the Tonight Show band. Renowned for his technical virtuosity, swinging lyricism, and signature "Mumbles" vocal style, Terry was also a passionate educator, mentoring generations of jazz musicians and founding youth jazz programs[1][2].

Hawkins and Terry collaborated memorably on the 1962 album "Back in Bean's Bag," which showcased their mutual respect and exuberant swing. Hawkins's sophisticated harmonic approach and Terry's playful, lyrical trumpet blended seamlessly, highlighting their mastery and versatility. Both artists left indelible marks on jazz, influencing countless musicians and shaping the evolution of the genre through their innovative playing, prolific recordings, and dedication to musical excellence[3][7][8].
