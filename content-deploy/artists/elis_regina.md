## Biography
Elis Regina Carvalho Costa (March 17, 1945 – January 19, 1982) was born in Porto Alegre, Brazil. She began her musical journey at age 11, performing on the children's radio show O Clube Do Guri on Rádio Farroupilha. By 1959, she had signed her first professional contract with Rádio Gaúcha and recorded her debut LP, 'Viva a Brotolândia', which showcased early influences from calypso and rock ’n’ roll. Her move to Rio de Janeiro in the early 1960s marked a turning point, as she immersed herself in the vibrant local music scene and performed at the famed Bossa Nova nightclub Beco das Garrafas.[3][4][6]

Regina's national breakthrough came in 1965 when she won the first Brazilian Popular Music Festival with a powerful rendition of 'Arrastão', composed by Edu Lobo and Vinícius de Moraes. This performance catapulted her to stardom and established her as a leading figure in the emerging MPB (Música Popular Brasileira) movement, which blended samba, bossa nova, and jazz with contemporary Brazilian songwriting. Her collaboration with Jair Rodrigues on 'Dois na Bossa' became the first Brazilian LP to sell over a million copies, and she continued to champion new composers such as Milton Nascimento, Ivan Lins, and Belchior by recording their works.[2][3][4]

Throughout the 1970s, Elis Regina's artistry evolved to include politically charged themes, often criticizing Brazil's military dictatorship and advocating for social justice. Her expressive voice, technical mastery, and emotional intensity earned her widespread acclaim, and she remains celebrated for her interpretations of classics like 'Águas de Março' with Antônio Carlos Jobim. Regina's legacy endures as one of Brazil's greatest vocalists, influencing generations of musicians and leaving an indelible mark on the country's cultural landscape.[2][4][5]
