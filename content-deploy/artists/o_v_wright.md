## Biography
Overton Vertis Wright, known professionally as O.V. Wright, was born on October 9, 1939, in Lenow (sometimes cited as Leno or Lens), Tennessee, near Memphis. He began singing in church as a child and quickly gained recognition for his vocal talent, making his first public appearance at age six. By his teenage years, Wright was performing with local gospel groups, including the 5 Harmoneers and The Sunset Travelers, recording spirituals for Peacock Records in the late 1950s and early 1960s.

Wright's transition to secular music came in 1964 when he recorded "That's How Strong My Love Is," a soulful ballad that became a regional hit and was later covered by Otis Redding and the Rolling Stones. Legal disputes over recording contracts led him to Don Robey's Back Beat label, where he achieved a string of R&B hits throughout the 1960s and early 1970s, including "You're Gonna Make Me Cry," "Eight Men, Four Women," "Ace of Spades," and "A Nickel and a Nail." His deeply emotive, gospel-infused vocal style, combined with collaborations with producer Willie Mitchell, established him as a leading figure in Southern soul and blues.

Despite his musical achievements, Wright struggled with drug addiction and legal troubles, serving time in prison during the mid-1970s. After his release, he continued to record, notably for Hi Records, but commercial success eluded him in his later years. O.V. Wright died of a heart attack on November 16, 1980, in Mobile, Alabama, at the age of 41. His legacy endures through his influence on generations of soul and blues artists, and he is remembered as one of the genre's most powerful and expressive voices.
