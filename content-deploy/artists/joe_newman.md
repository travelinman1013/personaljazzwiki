## Biography
Joseph Dwight Newman (September 7, 1922 – July 4, 1992) was an American jazz trumpeter, composer, and educator born in New Orleans, Louisiana, into a musical family; his father Dwight was a pianist who led the Creole Serenaders at the Absinthe House, and he received his first trumpet lessons from David Jones, one of Louis Armstrong’s teachers.[1][2][3] Starting trumpet at age six and lessons at eight, Newman attended Alabama State College, leading its band the Bama State Collegians on tour, where he was discovered by Lionel Hampton in 1941.[1][2] His early career bridged swing and bebop, joining Hampton's band for two years before signing with Count Basie's orchestra in 1943 for a total of thirteen years, interrupted by stints with Illinois Jacquet (1947) and J.C. Heard (late 1940s), and rejoining Basie from 1952 to 1961 as a primary soloist.[1][3]

Newman's musical style evolved from be-bop styling in his early career to innovative contemporary jazz, highlighted by small-group leader recordings like *All I Wanna Do Is Swing* (1955) and *The Midgets* (1956), and collaborations on Benny Goodman's 1962 Soviet Union tour.[1][3] In 1961, he co-founded Jazz Interactions, a charitable organization promoting jazz education through master classes, information services, and its own orchestra (for which he composed), serving as president from 1967 with his wife Rigmor Alfredsson Newman as executive director; this volunteer work brought exposure to emerging talents like Billy Cobham and Dave Liebman.[1][2] He continued touring internationally in the 1970s-1980s, recording for multiple labels, and worked in studios with artists including Judy Garland, Tony Bennett, Frank Sinatra, Aretha Franklin, and Quincy Jones.[3]

Newman's legacy endures as a dedicated jazz ambassador who balanced performance, composition, and education, contributing unpaid to Jazz Interactions despite career setbacks, while maintaining a prolific discography as leader and sideman.[1][2]

## Fun Facts
- Named his 1956 album *The Midgets* after playful 'war games' with water guns at Birdland between small band members (the Midgets, including Lester Young) and larger ones (the Bombers), led by owner Morris Levi.[2]
- Toured the Soviet Union in 1962 with Benny Goodman’s Big Band as part of a Cold War cultural exchange, while the Bolshoi Ballet performed in the U.S.[1][2]
- Despite career hindrance from unpaid Jazz Interactions work, he took pride in launching young musicians like Billy Cobham and Dave Liebman via low-pay Sunday Sessions.[2]
- Originally planned to call a tune 'The Mute And The Flute' but renamed it *The Midgets* due to Birdland antics.[2]
