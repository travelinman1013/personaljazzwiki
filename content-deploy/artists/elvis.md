## Biography
Elvis Aaron Presley was born on January 8, 1935, in Tupelo, Mississippi, to poor parents, and moved with his family to Memphis, Tennessee, at age 13 in 1948. He graduated from L.C. Humes High School in 1953 and began his music career in 1954 at Sun Records in Memphis under producer Sam Phillips, who sought to popularize African-American music sounds. Accompanied by guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black, Presley pioneered rockabilly, fusing country music and rhythm and blues, and bought his first guitar in 1946 for $7.90.[1][2][4][5]

In 1955, drummer D.J. Fontana joined to form Presley's classic quartet, and his contract was sold to RCA Victor, arranged by manager Colonel Tom Parker, who guided him thereafter. His first RCA single, 'Heartbreak Hotel' (1956), topped charts and sold over a million copies, launching national fame with hits like 'Don't Be Cruel' and 'Love Me Tender.' Drafted into the U.S. Army in 1958, he served in West Germany until honorably discharged in 1960, then focused on films and soundtracks in the 1960s, debuting in 'Love Me Tender' (1956). He married Priscilla Beaulieu in 1967, had daughter Lisa Marie in 1968, and divorced in 1973 amid health issues.[1][2][3][4][5]

Presley returned triumphantly with live Vegas shows in 1969, setting records, and continued performing until his final concert on June 26, 1977. Known as the King of Rock and Roll, he revolutionized popular music through electrifying performances blending rockabilly, rock and roll, gospel, and R&B influences from Beale Street and church. He died on August 16, 1977, at age 42 in Graceland, Memphis, cementing his mythical status in pop culture with enduring influence on generations.[1][2][4][5]
