## Biography
Zem Audu is a Grammy-winning saxophonist, composer, and producer born in Nigeria in 1986 and raised in London from age three before establishing himself in Brooklyn, New York. His musical journey began in childhood when he taught himself classical guitar and piano, eventually settling on the saxophone as his primary instrument of expression. He pursued formal training at the prestigious Trinity College of Music in London, where he studied independently with renowned saxophonist Courtney Pine and with Jean Toussaint, graduating top of his class in 2008. During his time in London, Audu became a formative presence in the city's groundbreaking Tomorrow's Warriors jazz scene, earning recognition through multiple awards including first place in the 2008 Worshipful Company Of Musicians Jazz Competition, a nomination for a Parliamentary Jazz Award for Best Jazz Saxophonist, and the Yamaha Jazz Scholars prize.

After relocating to New York, Audu became a fixture at Harlem's iconic St. Nick's Pub, where he honed his craft alongside other accomplished musicians. His career expanded significantly through international touring as saxophonist and frontman with reggae legends The Skatalites, experiences that deeply influenced his evolving musical aesthetic. His critically acclaimed debut album Spirits, released in 2017 on Origin Records and featuring legendary guitarist Mike Stern, marked a significant milestone in his evolution as a bandleader and improviser. The album showcased his ability to blend contemporary jazz, Nigerian afrobeat, Caribbean rhythms, and funk grooves—a sonic palette drawn from his transcontinental life experiences.

Audu's current artistic direction moves beyond traditional jazz into a genre-bending fusion of afrobeat, electronic textures, cinematic jazz, and dance-floor energy. As both a saxophonist and producer, he has collaborated with major artists including Taylor Swift, Bleachers, Kendrick Lamar, and Steel Pulse, establishing himself as a versatile sonic visionary. His work has garnered international press attention, including features in the New York Times. With his upcoming EP You Can't Catch Me, Audu continues to evolve as an artist, creating music designed for holistic movement—body, mind, and soul.
