## Biography
Little Johnny Jones (November 1, 1924 – November 19, 1964) was a pivotal figure in the Chicago blues scene, renowned for his dynamic piano playing and soulful vocals. Born in Jackson, Mississippi, Jones was immersed in music from an early age, learning both piano and harmonica under the influence of his musically inclined family. His cousin, Otis Spann, would also become a legendary blues pianist, and both were deeply influenced by the great Big Maceo Merriweather. Jones moved to Chicago in the mid-1940s, quickly establishing himself among the city's burgeoning blues community.

Jones’s career flourished as he became a sought-after accompanist and band member. He replaced Big Maceo Merriweather in Tampa Red's band after Merriweather suffered a stroke, and soon after, Jones was recording and performing with blues luminaries such as Muddy Waters, Elmore James, and Howlin' Wolf. His energetic performances at Chicago's famed Sylvio’s club, where he played with multiple bands each night, became legendary. Jones's style was characterized by a robust, rhythmic approach to the piano, blending boogie-woogie with the emotional depth of the blues. His recordings, including the classic 'Big Town Playboy,' left an indelible mark on the genre. Despite a relatively short life, Jones’s influence extended through his collaborations and his role in shaping the sound of postwar Chicago blues.
