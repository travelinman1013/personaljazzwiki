## Biography
Chocolate Milk was a pioneering American funk and soul band formed in 1974, originally in Memphis, Tennessee, before relocating to New Orleans, Louisiana. The group emerged during the heyday of funk and soul, inspired by contemporaries like Kool & the Gang and Earth, Wind & Fire. The core lineup included Frank Richard (lead vocals), Amadee Castenell (saxophone), Joe Foxx (trumpet), Mario Tio (guitar), Earnest Dabon (bass), Robert Dabon (keyboards/piano), and Dwight Richards (drums/percussion). Their name symbolized both the racial and cultural blend of New Orleans and the eclectic mix of genres—jazz, funk, soul, and disco—that defined their sound.[1][2][3]

Chocolate Milk quickly became the studio band for legendary New Orleans songwriter and producer Allen Toussaint, succeeding The Meters in this role. They backed Toussaint in live performances and on recordings, most notably on his 'New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival' album (1976), and even collaborated with Paul McCartney. Signing with RCA Records, the band released eight albums between 1975 and 1983. Their debut, 'Action Speaks Louder Than Words,' featured the title track that became an R&B Top 20 hit, notable for its political message and influential break beat. Over time, Chocolate Milk evolved their style, incorporating disco elements, as heard in their 1981 hit 'Blue Jeans.'[2][3][4][5]

Despite their initial success, the band faced challenges in the early 1980s, including shifts in musical tastes, frequent personnel and producer changes, and the decline of disco. After parting ways with Toussaint in 1980, Chocolate Milk disbanded in 1983. Their legacy, however, endures through their innovative fusion of genres, their role in the New Orleans music scene, and the lasting influence of their sampled grooves in hip-hop music.[2][1][3]
