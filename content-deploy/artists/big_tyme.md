## Biography
The Big Tymers, stylized as Big Tymer$, was an American hip hop duo formed in 1997 in New Orleans, Louisiana, consisting of Cash Money Records co-founder Brian 'Baby' Williams (later Birdman) and the label's in-house producer Mannie Fresh (born Mannie Byron). Mannie Fresh and Baby Williams met in 1992, soon co-founding Cash Money Records with Williams's brother Ronald 'Slim' Williams, establishing a powerhouse independent label that popularized Southern hip-hop through artists like Juvenile and B.G.[1][2][3] Fresh handled production, crafting layered beats with smooth, bouncy Southern styles, while Baby contributed rhymes celebrating wealth, luxury cars, strip clubs, and materialism, emblematic of Cash Money's ethos.[2]

The duo debuted on B.G.'s 1997 album *It's All on U, Vol. 2*, followed by their own *How You Luv That* (1997, reissued as Vol. 2 in 1998), which sold 100,000 copies independently and featured Cash Money roster like Lil Wayne, Juvenile, B.G., and Turk.[1][2][3] Their breakthrough came with *I Got That Work* (2000), topping R&B/hip-hop charts with hits 'Get Your Roll On' and '#1 Stunna'; *Hood Rich* (2002) hit #1 on the Billboard 200, driven by 'Still Fly' peaking at #11 on the Hot 100.[1][3] The duo's final album, *Big Money Heavyweight* (2003), preceded Mannie Fresh's 2005 departure from Cash Money over financial disputes with Birdman and Slim, dissolving the act, though they reunited briefly in 2018 for 'Designer Caskets'.[1][3]

Rooted in New Orleans bounce and crunk, their music blended boisterous Southern hip-hop with urban/R&B flair, significantly boosting Cash Money's national profile and Southern rap's mainstream rise before their split.[1][2][3]
