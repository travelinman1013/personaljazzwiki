## Biography
Eliana Pittman (born Eliana Leite da Silva on August 14, 1945, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) is a Brazilian singer and actress closely associated with bossa nova and Brazilian jazz.[3][4] She became the stepdaughter of expatriate American jazz saxophonist and clarinetist Booker Pittman around age 11, and he became her first music teacher, mentor, and early recording partner.[3][5][6] Under his guidance she developed a swinging, jazz-oriented vocal style with a strong gift for scat singing, and began performing as a teenager in Rio’s Beco das Garrafas nightclub scene, debuting at the Little Club before gaining international exposure on Jack Paar’s U.S. television show in 1964.[2] 

Pittman started recording in the early 1960s in duo projects with Booker Pittman, including albums such as *Eliana e Booker Pittman* (1962) and *News From Brazil / New Sound Brazil Bossa Nova* (1963), which blended American jazz standards with Brazilian bossa and samba.[1][3][7] Through the mid‑1960s and 1970s she built a solo career with albums like *É Preciso Cantar* (1966), *Positivamente, Eliana* (1968), *Tô Chegando, Já Cheguei* (1974), and *Pra Sempre* (1976), becoming known in Brazil and abroad as one of the more soulful Brazilian vocalists of her era.[1][3] Her first major hit was “Tristeza” in 1966, which brought her broad recognition across South America, and she toured extensively through Brazil, Europe, Japan, the United States, Spain, and Venezuela while also serving as official hostess of MIDEM in Cannes from 1968 to 1971.[2][3] 

Stylistically, Pittman is noted for her powerful, swinging delivery, fluent scat improvisation, and the ability to turn light pop or novelty material into jazz‑based performances, drawing on both North American jazz and Brazilian samba‑cancão, bossa nova, and nightclub repertoire.[1][3] From the late 1960s onward she also developed a substantial parallel career as a television and film actress, appearing in productions such as *Run for Your Life* (1966), *The Sandpit Generals* (1971), *Jubiabá* (1986), and later telenovelas and series including *América*, *Tempos Modernos*, *Preamar*, *Sangue Bom*, and *Girls from Ipanema*.[3] In the 2000s she resumed touring, beginning with a new show launched in Rio de Janeiro in 2001, and has since alternated periods of artistic activity with more private life, while being regarded as a treasured figure of Brazilian jazz and bossa history whose early work with Booker Pittman documents an important bridge between U.S. jazz traditions and Brazilian popular music.[3][7]

### Artists Influenced
- [[no_specific_individual_artists_reliably_documented|No specific individual artists reliably documented]] - Available sources describe her as a soulful Brazilian vocalist with strong scat technique and a role in popularizing jazz‑inflected bossa and samba, but do not name direct protégés or specific later artists explicitly citing her as an influence.

[Influence broadly associated with her peak recording and touring years in the 1960s–1970s and later reappraisal of that work.[1][2][3][7]]
