## Biography
William John Evans was born on August 16, 1929, in Plainfield, New Jersey, to a devout Russian Orthodox mother and a father of Welsh origins who managed a golf course. He began playing piano at age 4 or 5 under his mother's tutelage and received classical training, also studying violin and flute. At 13, he fell in love with jazz, though he would continue to draw heavily on his classical background throughout his career. Evans graduated from Southeastern Louisiana University in Hammond in 1950 with a degree in music education, initially planning to become a flautist before focusing on piano. After serving three years in the army playing flute with the Fifth Army Band near Chicago, he moved to New York City in 1955 to pursue a career in jazz.

Evans quickly made his mark on the New York jazz scene despite his introspective solos and delicate touch being far removed from the hard bop style dominant at the time. He worked with bandleader and theorist George Russell, whose pioneering approach to music theory from a jazz perspective deeply influenced Evans's harmonic concepts. His 1957 debut album "New Jazz Conceptions" revealed a fully formed technique characterized by fresh harmonic approaches and sensitive phrasing. In 1958, Evans joined Miles Davis's sextet alongside John Coltrane and Cannonball Adderley, becoming a central figure in Davis's shift to modal improvisation and contributing to "Kind of Blue" in 1959, which became the best-selling jazz album of all time. His extensive use of impressionist harmony, block chords, innovative chord voicings, and trademark rhythmically independent "singing" melodic lines distinguished his playing style.

Leaving Davis's band in late 1959, Evans formed his own trio with bassist Scott LaFaro and drummer Paul Motian, developing a revolutionary approach to trio playing where all instruments carried melodic responsibilities and functioned as equal voices rather than following traditional piano-led arrangements. This seminal unit recorded four albums, including the studio albums "Portrait in Jazz" and "Explorations," and the live recordings "Sunday at the Village Vanguard" and "Waltz for Debby" from a 1961 engagement at New York's Village Vanguard. LaFaro's tragic death in a highway accident ten days after this booking devastated Evans, who withdrew from public performance for months. He later reemerged with bassist Chuck Israels in 1963, the same year he won a Grammy for "Conversations with Myself," an innovative solo album using overdubbing technology. In 1966, he began an 11-year collaboration with bassist Eddie Gómez. Evans also worked with singer Tony Bennett on two critically acclaimed albums in the mid-1970s. Throughout his career, Evans struggled with addiction, which affected his health and artistry. He passed away on September 15, 1980, in New York at age 51, but his contributions continue to influence generations of jazz musicians with his refined touch, complex harmonic concepts, and revolutionary approach to trio interaction.
