## Biography
Roberto Torres, born on February 10, 1940 in Güines, Cuba, is a distinguished Cuban singer, percussionist, bandleader, composer, and producer. He began his musical journey in his mid-teens, quickly establishing himself as a versatile performer skilled in maracas, güiro, and clave.

His legacy extends beyond performance, as he has contributed to important documentaries such as 'Son, la antesala de la salsa' alongside figures like Celia Cruz and Arturo Sandoval.
