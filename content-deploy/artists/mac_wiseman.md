## Biography
Mac Wiseman (born Malcolm Bell Wiseman on May 23, 1925, in Crimora, Virginia) was an American singer and guitarist whose clear, high tenor made him one of the defining voices of early bluegrass and country music.[1][2] Raised in Virginia’s Shenandoah Valley and weakened by the after‑effects of infantile paralysis, he spent much of his childhood listening to records and radio, learning songs, and accompanying himself on guitar while his mother carefully wrote down lyrics he liked in notebooks.[2] After high school he briefly worked in a manganese mine before enrolling in a broadcasting course at Shenandoah Conservatory, which led to a job as an announcer at WSVA in Harrisonburg, Virginia.[2] Radio work soon merged into performance: by the mid‑1940s he was singing and playing bass and guitar on stations across the Mid‑Atlantic and South, combining his ease as a pitchman with a growing reputation as a compelling country vocalist.[2]

Wiseman’s professional music career took off when he joined Molly O’Day’s Cumberland Mountain Folks in 1946 as an upright bass player, participating in their early Columbia recordings and gaining first‑hand experience with the commercial music world.[2] In 1948 he became guitarist and featured singer with Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs’ newly formed Foggy Mountain Boys, and in 1949 he joined Bill Monroe’s Blue Grass Boys, appearing on the Grand Ole Opry and on classic Monroe recordings.[1][2][3] By the early 1950s he had moved into a solo career, joining the Louisiana Hayride in Shreveport and becoming the first country artist signed to the then‑new Dot Records; his early Dot single “’Tis Sweet to Be Remembered” became a regional hit and his lifelong theme song.[2][3] Throughout the 1950s he scored country successes with “The Ballad of Davy Crockett” (1955) and “Jimmy Brown the Newsboy” (1959), and he later recorded for labels including Capitol and his own Wise Records, issuing both straight country and bluegrass‑leaning material while deliberately avoiding being confined to any single style.[1][2][3]

Stylistically, Wiseman was known as “The Voice with a Heart,” a reflection of his smooth, emotionally direct tenor and his gift for narrative ballads and sentimental story‑songs.[1][2] Although he emerged with the first generation of bluegrass pioneers and worked with many of its giants, his repertoire ranged broadly across hillbilly, country, folk, pop‑tinged material, and even big‑band and Americana collaborations later in life.[1][3] Beyond performing, he played a major role in the country and bluegrass business infrastructure: in the late 1950s he moved with Dot Records to California and headed its country and A&R division, and he later co‑founded the Country Music Association (CMA), helping promote country music nationwide.[1][2] In 1986 he also co‑founded the International Bluegrass Music Association (IBMA), and in 1993 he was inducted into the International Bluegrass Music Hall of Honor.[1][2] Wiseman remained active and artistically vital into his nineties, recording with artists from big‑band leader Woody Herman to guitarist Duane Eddy and songwriter John Prine.[1] He died in Nashville, Tennessee, on February 24, 2019, from kidney failure at the age of 93, leaving a legacy as one of bluegrass and country music’s most eloquent and enduring voices.[1][3]

## Fun Facts
- A disc jockey dubbed him “The Voice with a Heart,” a nickname that stuck with fans and became synonymous with his clear, expressive tenor singing.[1]
- He began his professional life not as a performer but as a radio announcer, only deciding to pursue performance full‑time after realizing that the better money in the entertainment business lay with the artists, not the announcers.[2][5]
- He was the first country music artist signed to Dot Records, and his first Dot single, “’Tis Sweet to Be Remembered,” recorded at the Louisiana Hayride studios, became a regional best‑seller and his lifelong theme song.[2][3]
- Wiseman was unusual among early bluegrass stars in building a parallel business career: he ran mail‑order record operations, headed Dot’s country division, co‑founded the Country Music Association, and later co‑founded the International Bluegrass Music Association, helping institutionalize the very genre he had helped create.[1][2]
