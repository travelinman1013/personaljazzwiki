## Biography
Luther Kent, born Kent Rowell on June 23, 1948, in New Orleans, Louisiana, was a celebrated American blues and R&B singer renowned for his powerful, soulful voice and dynamic stage presence[2][1]. Growing up in the vibrant musical environment of New Orleans, Kent was deeply influenced by the city's rich traditions and artists such as Bobby 'Blue' Bland, Etta James, and Ray Charles[2][6]. He began singing professionally at just 14, signing his first record deal with Montel Records and quickly establishing himself in local bands and venues[2][3][4][5].

Kent's career spanned over six decades, during which he became a fixture of the New Orleans music scene. He led the horn-driven group Luther Kent & Trick Bag, which blended swinging blues with New Orleans R&B and became a staple on Bourbon Street throughout the 1970s and 1980s[2][1]. Kent also joined Blood, Sweat & Tears as lead singer in 1974, touring with them though contractual obligations prevented him from recording with the group[2][1]. His collaborations included work with Charlie Brent, Allen Toussaint, Pete Fountain, and The Dukes of Dixieland, and he toured internationally, notably in Italy with Robi Zonca[2].

Kent's legacy is marked by his dedication to authentic rhythm and blues, his ability to bridge racial divides in music during the civil rights era, and his influence on the New Orleans sound. He released several solo and collaborative albums, contributed to television and advertising projects, and remained active in performance and radio until his passing from heart failure on August 16, 2024, at age 76[2][1].
