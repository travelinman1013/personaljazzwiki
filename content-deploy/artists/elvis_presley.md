## Biography
Elvis Aaron Presley was born on January 8, 1935, in Tupelo, Mississippi, to Gladys and Vernon Presley, in a two-room house where his identical twin brother, Jesse Garon, was stillborn.[2][4] Raised in poverty but in a tightly knit, religious family, he was steeped in the gospel music of the Assembly of God church, along with the country and pop he heard on radio and the Black rhythm and blues he absorbed after the family moved to Memphis, Tennessee, in 1948.[2][3][4] He received his first guitar at age 11 and learned basic chords from relatives and a pastor, later drawing inspiration from local radio figures like Mississippi Slim while developing an intense, self-directed passion for music.[2][4] After graduating from Humes High School in Memphis in 1953, he worked various jobs, including truck driving, while making demo recordings at Sun Studio and hoping for a break in the music business.[1][4]

Presley began his professional career in 1954 at Sun Records with producer Sam Phillips, who paired him with guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black; together they forged a dynamic fusion of country, blues, and rhythm and blues that came to be known as rockabilly.[2][3] His early recordings, including “That’s All Right,” quickly attracted regional and then national attention, and by 1956, after his contract was sold to RCA Victor, he was an international sensation with hits like “Heartbreak Hotel,” “Hound Dog,” and “Don’t Be Cruel,” as well as high-profile television appearances and film roles that cemented his image as the “King of Rock and Roll.”[1][2][4] Drafted into the U.S. Army in 1958, he returned to a career increasingly focused on movies and soundtrack albums in the 1960s, before reasserting his musical power with the 1968 television “Comeback Special” and a series of Las Vegas residencies and concert tours in the 1970s.[2][3]

Musically, Presley synthesized country, gospel, blues, and pop, delivering them with a highly personal vocal style that ranged from tender balladry to raw, rhythm-driven performances, often backed by tight rhythm sections, electric guitar, and vocal groups that reflected his deep gospel roots.[2][3][4] His charismatic stage presence, provocative dance moves, and crossover appeal to both white and Black audiences transformed the landscape of popular music and youth culture in the 1950s, helping to bring African-American musical styles to a mass white audience.[2][3] Despite personal struggles, health issues, and artistic ups and downs, he remained a dominant cultural figure until his death at Graceland in Memphis on August 16, 1977, and his legacy endures in record sales, countless posthumous releases, and a profound influence on rock, pop, and country musicians worldwide.[2][3][4]

## Fun Facts
- Presley was a twin; his brother Jesse Garon Presley was stillborn, leaving Elvis to grow up as an only child.[2][4]
- He famously received a grade of C in music in school, and a teacher once told him he had no aptitude for singing, prompting him to bring his guitar to class to prove otherwise.[2]
- Before fame, Presley worked as a truck driver, including a job at Crown Electric, while making demo recordings at Sun Studio on the side.[1][4]
- He was deeply devoted to his parents, especially his mother Gladys, and the family relied at times on welfare and neighbors’ help during his impoverished childhood in Mississippi and Tennessee.[2][3]

## Musical Connections

### Mentors/Influences
- [[sam_phillips|Sam Phillips]] - Producer at Sun Records who recognized Presley’s potential and helped shape his early rockabilly sound, aiming to bring African-American–influenced music to a broader audience. (Early Sun sessions including “That’s All Right” and other 1954–1955 recordings.) [1954–1955]
- [[mississippi_slim_carvel_lee_ausborn|Mississippi Slim (Carvel Lee Ausborn)]] - Radio performer whose show Presley avidly followed; Slim showed him chord techniques and gave him early on-air performance opportunities. (Informal mentoring and radio performances, not commercial releases.) [Late 1940s–early 1950s[2]]
- [[gospel_and_black_randb_artists_various|Gospel and Black R&B artists (various)]] - Presley drew heavily from the gospel music of the Assembly of God church and the Black rhythm and blues he heard in Memphis, which deeply informed his vocal style and repertoire. (Influence evident in recordings such as his gospel albums and R&B-derived rock and roll singles.) [Formative years through his entire career[3][4]]

### Key Collaborators
- [[scotty_moore|Scotty Moore]] - Lead guitarist in Presley’s original band, integral to the development of his early rockabilly sound at Sun and into the RCA years. (Sun and early RCA singles including “That’s All Right” and other mid-1950s recordings.) [1954–mid 1950s[2][3]]
- [[bill_black|Bill Black]] - Bassist who, with Presley and Scotty Moore, formed the core trio that defined Presley’s early recordings and live performances. (Sun Records sessions and early live shows, including the first rockabilly recordings.) [1954–mid 1950s[2][3]]
- [[the_jordanaires|The Jordanaires]] - Vocal quartet that provided background vocals on many of Presley’s classic RCA recordings and film soundtracks, reinforcing his gospel-inflected sound. (Numerous singles and albums from the late 1950s and 1960s, including major hits.) [Late 1950s–1960s[2]]

### Artists Influenced
- [[the_beatles|The Beatles]] - Members of The Beatles cited Presley as a formative inspiration, particularly his early rock and roll recordings and charismatic image. (Early Beatles rock and roll recordings and stage performances that drew on his style.) [1960s (influence originating from his 1950s work)[2][3]]
- [[bob_dylan|Bob Dylan]] - Dylan and other 1960s singer-songwriters acknowledged the impact of Presley’s breakthrough on the possibilities of rock as an expressive form. (General orientation toward rock as a serious artistic medium rather than a specific collaboration.) [1960s onward (influenced by Presley’s 1950s–1960s output)[3]]
- [[modern_rock_pop_and_country_artists_various|Modern rock, pop, and country artists (various)]] - Presley’s fusion of country, blues, and gospel into rock and roll set a template for countless later performers across genres, from rock frontmen to country crossover stars. (Broad stylistic borrowing in performance style, vocal approach, and repertoire across many artists’ catalogs.) [Late 1950s onward[2][3][7]]
