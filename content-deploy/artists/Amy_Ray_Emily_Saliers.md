## Biography
Amy Ray and Emily Saliers, collectively known as the Indigo Girls, are a pioneering folk-rock duo whose partnership began in childhood in Decatur, Georgia. Ray, born April 12, 1964, in Atlanta, and Saliers, born July 22, 1963, in New Haven, Connecticut, met at Laurel Ridge Elementary School and began performing together in high school talent shows. After attending separate colleges—Ray at Vanderbilt and Saliers at Tulane—they reunited at Emory University, where they solidified their musical aspirations and began performing in Atlanta clubs under various names before settling on 'Indigo Girls.'[3][4][6]

Their career took off in the mid-1980s with the release of their independent single 'Crazy Game' and the EP 'Strange Fire.' Signing with Epic Records in 1988, their eponymous major-label debut featured the hit 'Closer to Fine' and propelled them to national prominence. Over four decades, the Indigo Girls have released 16 studio albums, earned a Grammy Award, and sold over 15 million records. Their signature sound blends Appalachian folk, pop, and rock influences, characterized by intricate harmonies and introspective, socially conscious lyrics. Beyond their music, Ray and Saliers are celebrated for their activism, particularly in LGBTQ+ rights, environmental causes, and social justice, cementing their legacy as both musical and cultural icons.[1][4][6][7]

Their enduring partnership and willingness to address personal and political themes have inspired generations of artists and fans. Both have also pursued solo projects—Ray with a series of solo albums and the founding of Daemon Records, and Saliers with her own solo album and collaborations—while maintaining the Indigo Girls as a vital force in American music.[2][3][7]
