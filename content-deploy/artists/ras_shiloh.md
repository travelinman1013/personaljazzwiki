## Biography
Ras Shiloh, born Thomas Williams on January 6, 1975, in Brooklyn, New York, is a reggae artist known for his distinctive tenor vocals and conscious roots reggae style. Raised in the culturally diverse borough of Brooklyn, where multiple cultures blended due to the area's diverse populace, Shiloh began his music career at the remarkably young age of nine years old, initially performing under the moniker "Big Belly Youth." His family has roots in North Carolina, and he is notably the cousin of soul singer Betty Wright, which connected him to a rich musical heritage from an early age.

Throughout his career spanning from the mid-1990s onward, Ras Shiloh established himself as a conscious modern roots singer in the tradition of late reggae legend Garnett Silk, who served as his mentor and primary stylistic influence. His tenor vocals have drawn frequent comparisons to Silk's emotive delivery and spiritual depth. Shiloh's musical output includes several albums and singles that showcase his commitment to roots reggae and lovers rock traditions, positioning him within the broader conscious reggae movement that emphasizes social awareness and spiritual themes.

Despite his talent and consistent output, Ras Shiloh has remained somewhat underrated in the broader music industry, though he has maintained a dedicated following, particularly in Northern California where he has been recognized as a valued live performance artist. His work continues to represent the conscious roots reggae tradition, blending the cultural influences of his Brooklyn upbringing with the spiritual and lyrical depth characteristic of modern roots reggae.
