## Biography
Eddie "Lockjaw" Davis (Edward F. Davis, March 2, 1922 – November 3, 1986) was a self-taught American jazz tenor saxophonist born in Harlem, New York City. He began playing professionally in Harlem just eight months after acquiring his first saxophone, quickly immersing himself in the vibrant jazz scene of the late 1930s. By his teens, Davis was already a fixture at Clark Monroe’s Uptown House and the legendary Minton’s Playhouse, venues central to the development of bebop, though his own style remained rooted in swing and blues, influenced by the robust Texas tenor tradition[2][3][4].

Davis's career spanned several decades and genres, including swing, bop, hard bop, Latin jazz, soul jazz, and even rhythm and blues. He played with major figures such as Cootie Williams, Lucky Millinder, Andy Kirk, Louis Armstrong, and most notably, Count Basie, with whom he had several stints from the 1950s into the 1970s[1][2][5]. In the mid-1950s, Davis pioneered the tenor saxophone and Hammond organ combo, collaborating with Shirley Scott and helping to define the soul jazz sound. He also co-led a celebrated quintet with fellow tenor Johnny Griffin and was a member of the Kenny Clarke/Francy Boland Big Band in Europe. Davis continued to perform and record prolifically until his death from Hodgkin's lymphoma in 1986[1][5].

Known for his full-bodied, reedy tone and direct, singing approach, Davis left a lasting mark on jazz saxophone. His stylistic versatility and innovation, particularly in the tenor-organ format, influenced generations of saxophonists and helped bridge the gap from the big band era to modern jazz[4].

## Fun Facts
