## Biography
Les Filles de Illighadad ("the daughters of Illighadad") is a Tuareg women-led band from the remote village of Illighadad in central Niger, on the edge of the Sahara desert.[3][4] The group was founded around 2016 by guitarist and bandleader Fatou Seidi Ghali and vocalist Alamnou Akrouni, both raised in a pastoral community where music is deeply woven into daily life and women traditionally lead communal singing using the tende drum.[3][7] Ghali is widely described as one of the first prominent Tuareg women to play electric guitar professionally, breaking local gender norms that had long reserved the instrument and the "desert blues" style for men.[2][6]

From the start, Les Filles de Illighadad set out to merge two musical worlds: ancient village tende ceremonies and the electrified Tuareg guitar music popularized in cities like Agadez.[3][6] Their early recordings, made in and around their home village, emphasized call‑and‑response vocals, handclaps, and the pounding of mortar-and-pestle drums, while Ghali’s hypnotic guitar lines drew on the modal patterns of Tuareg desert blues.[3][4] In November 2016 the band entered Bear Cave Studio in Cologne to record *Eghass Malan*, their first full studio album, transforming rural nomadic songs into layered, avant-rock‑tinged arrangements that brought them to international stages and festivals.[4][7]

Musically, Les Filles de Illighadad are known for foregrounding the tende tradition as the rhythmic and spiritual core of their sound, rather than treating it as background texture to guitar-driven rock.[3][6] Their performances emphasize collective participation, looping grooves, and polyphonic vocals that blur the boundary between performer and audience, echoing the communal role of music in Tuareg village life.[3][8] As one of the first female Tuareg guitar bands to gain global recognition, they have become emblematic of a new Tuareg folk revival that recenters women’s musical practices and expands who is seen as an innovator within the desert blues genre.[2][6]

## Fun Facts
- The name "Les Filles de Illighadad" literally means "the daughters of Illighadad," a reference to their home village and to the tradition of women leading tende ceremonies there.[3][4]
- Fatou Seidi Ghali learned guitar in a rural setting where very few women played the instrument, and her emergence as a professional Tuareg guitarist has been widely described as a historic first for Tuareg women.[2][6]
- Before recording in a studio, the band was first documented through on‑site field recordings in and around Illighadad, capturing performances in courtyards and open-air village settings.[4][7]
- Their first studio album *Eghass Malan* was recorded not in Niger but at Bear Cave Studio in Cologne, Germany, only a few weeks after an early European festival appearance.[4][7]
