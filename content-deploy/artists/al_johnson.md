## Biography
Al Jolson, born Asa Yoelson on May 26, 1886, in Sredniki, Russian Empire (now Lithuania), was an American singer, comedian, actor, and vaudeville performer of Jewish descent. His family immigrated to Washington, D.C., where his father worked as a cantor; after his mother's death when he was eight, young Asa found solace in street corner singing and performing with his brother Harry for soldiers and senators during the Spanish-American War era. He began his career in burlesque and vaudeville in New York, initially struggling, but broke through as a solo act in San Francisco around 1906, adopting blackface with a distinctive style featuring white gloves, socks, and outlined mouth to emphasize his dynamic singing and whistling.[1][3][4]

Jolson's career skyrocketed in 1909 when he joined Lew Dockstader's Minstrels, refining his blackface persona, and by 1911 he starred in Broadway revues like *La Belle Paree* and *Vera Violetta*, introducing improvisational gags and songs such as Stephen Foster tunes. Hits like *Sinbad* (1918) featured George Gershwin's 'Swanee' and his signature 'My Mammy,' making him Broadway's biggest star by 1920. His brash, extroverted style popularized African-American musical forms for white audiences; he starred in *The Jazz Singer* (1927), the first major talking picture, cementing his fame through films, records, radio, and WWII troop entertainments. A 1940s revival via *The Jolson Story* (1946) and Decca recordings saw him voted 'Most Popular Male Vocalist' in 1948 despite younger rivals like Bing Crosby.[1][3][4]

Jolson died on October 23, 1950, from a heart attack shortly after performing 42 shows for Korean War troops, earning a posthumous Medal for Merit. His legacy is complex: hailed as 'The World's Greatest Entertainer' for opening white ears to black musical traditions, yet criticized for perpetuating blackface stereotypes, though he fought Broadway discrimination as early as 1911 and was praised by Black publications.[1][4]
