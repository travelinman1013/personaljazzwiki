## Biography
James Sylvester Scott (February 12, 1885 – August 30, 1938) was born in Neosho, Missouri, to former slaves James Scott Sr. and Molly Thomas Scott, as one of six children. Primarily self-taught with perfect pitch, he learned piano by ear before taking lessons from local teachers John Coleman and Emma Johns DeArmond while attending Lincoln High School in Carthage, Missouri, after his family moved there in 1901. Scott began working at Charles L. Dumars' music store, demonstrating pieces including his own, leading to the publication of his first composition, 'A Summer Breeze - March and Two Step,' in 1903, followed by 'Fascinator March' and 'On the Pike March' in 1904.[1][2][4]

In 1905, inspired by Scott Joplin, Scott traveled to St. Louis, where Joplin introduced him to publisher John Stillwell Stark, who released 'Frog Legs Rag' in 1906, a massive hit second only to Joplin's 'Maple Leaf Rag' in Stark's catalog. Scott became a key contributor to Stark until 1922, producing classics like 'Climax Rag,' 'Grace and Beauty,' 'Ophelia Rag,' and 'The Ragtime Oriole.' He moved to Kansas City in 1914, marrying Nora Johnson, teaching music, leading an eight-piece band for dances and beer parks, and accompanying silent films at the Panama Theater. Known as the 'Little Professor' for his quiet demeanor, his style blended classic ragtime structure with lively syncopation, solidifying his place as one of the 'Big Three' ragtime composers alongside Joplin and Joseph Lamb.[1][2][3][7]

Scott's fortunes declined with the advent of 'talkies' in the late 1920s; he lost theater work, his wife died in 1930 without children, and chronic dropsy worsened his health. He lived with cousin Ruth Callahan in Kansas City, Kansas, continuing to compose, teach, and accompany dances until his death at Douglas Hospital on August 30, 1938, at age 52. Buried beside his wife in Westlawn Cemetery, Scott's legacy endures as a cornerstone of ragtime, influencing jazz's development.[1][2][3]

## Fun Facts
- Scott was nicknamed the 'Little Professor' due to his quiet demeanor and prodigious talent as a young pianist.
- He formed his own segregated eight-piece band with Black musicians recruited from as far as Joplin, Missouri, performing at parks, churches, and social events.
- His hit 'Frog Legs Rag' was the second best-seller in John Stark's catalog, only behind Scott Joplin's iconic 'Maple Leaf Rag.'
- Scott had perfect pitch and was largely self-taught before formal lessons, becoming a headliner at Lakeside Amusement Park in Carthage.
