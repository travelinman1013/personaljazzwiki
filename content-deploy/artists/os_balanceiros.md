## Biography
Based on available evidence, **Os Balanceiros** appears not to be a documented, discrete musical artist or group but rather a likely metadata or tagging error in certain playlist or database entries. The clearest trace is an entry in the WWOZ New Orleans 90.7 FM playlist, where "Os Balanceiros" is listed in association with the standard "Hello Dolly"; however, there is no corroborating information in Brazilian or international discographies, press articles, databases, or liner-note style resources that identifies Os Balanceiros as a band, ensemble, or solo act with a verifiable history.[6]

Extensive searches in Portuguese and English sources that typically document Brazilian or lusophone artists (including general web results, music journalism, biographies, and fan wikis) return results for similarly named entities such as *Forró Balancear* and songs titled "Balanceiro" but nothing substantive about any group or artist formally called Os Balanceiros.[2][3][5] In the absence of any biographical details, discography, live performance records, line-ups, or interviews, it is not possible to write a factual narrative about early life, career development, musical style, or legacy without inventing information, which would be inaccurate.

Given the lack of independently verifiable documentation, Os Balanceiros should, for now, be treated as an **unverified or possibly misattributed artist name** rather than as an established act with a traceable career. Any detailed biography beyond this clarification would necessarily be speculative and is therefore omitted here to maintain accuracy.

## Fun Facts
- The only clear occurrence of the credit "Os Balanceiros" located in public sources is in a WWOZ New Orleans 90.7 FM playlist entry tied to the standard "Hello Dolly," with no further contextual information such as album, label, or recording date.[6]
- Searches in Portuguese-language biographical and fan wikis that often document even small regional Brazilian acts (for example, entries on groups like Forró Balancear) do not turn up any entry or discussion for an artist or band called Os Balanceiros, suggesting the name is either extremely obscure or a metadata error.[2]
- The word "balanceiro" appears in Brazilian music as a song title and lyrical motif, particularly in Northeastern Brazilian contexts, which may have contributed to tagging or naming confusion with "Os Balanceiros" in digital playlists.[3][5]
