## Biography
Don Ewell was born on November 14, 1916, in Baltimore, Maryland. He began playing piano at the age of ten and was initially interested in classical music, studying at the Peabody Institute. However, he soon shifted his focus to jazz, influenced by pianists like Earl Hines, Teddy Wilson, and Jelly Roll Morton.

After the war, he moved to Chicago and played with Bill Reinhardt's Jazz, Ltd. band from 1947 to 1949. In the 1950s, Ewell joined Kid Ory's band and later became a member of Jack Teagarden's band from 1956 to 1962. His career was marked by performances with notable jazz figures such as Sidney Bechet, George Lewis, and Bunk Johnson. Ewell's playing style was characterized by his ability to synthesize various influences while maintaining a unique sound. Despite facing personal challenges, including alcoholism and health issues, Ewell continued to perform until his death on August 9, 1983, in Pompano Beach, Florida. His legacy as a jazz stride pianist remains significant, with his music being described as joyous and multi-hued. Ewell's contributions to traditional jazz are celebrated for their depth and emotional resonance, even if he never achieved widespread fame during his lifetime.
