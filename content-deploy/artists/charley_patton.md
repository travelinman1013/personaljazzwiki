## Biography
Charley Patton, often called the 'Father of the Delta Blues,' was born around 1891 in Hinds County, Mississippi, near Edwards or Bolton. Raised in a sharecropping family, Patton moved as a child to Dockery's Plantation, a hub for blues musicians in the Mississippi Delta. There, he absorbed musical influences from older guitarists and began performing locally, developing a distinctive style marked by raw, emotive vocals and percussive, polyrhythmic guitar playing[1][2][3][4].

Patton's career flourished in the early 20th century as he traveled throughout the South, playing at rural parties, barrelhouses, and dances. He recorded nearly 70 tracks between 1929 and 1934, including classics like 'Pony Blues,' 'Down the Dirt Road Blues,' and 'High Water Everywhere.' His performances were noted for their aggressive intensity, showmanship, and the ability to captivate audiences with both music and stage antics, such as playing guitar behind his back[1][2][3].

Patton's legacy is profound: his innovative approach to blues guitar and singing laid the foundation for future generations of blues artists. He influenced iconic musicians such as Robert Johnson, Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, Son House, and Bukka White, shaping the sound and spirit of American blues. Patton was posthumously inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1980, cementing his status as a cornerstone of American music[1][2][3].

## Fun Facts
- Patton was known for his flamboyant stage presence, often playing guitar behind his back or between his legs to entertain audiences[2].
- His vocal style was so loud and gravelly that it could be heard across large, noisy venues, making him a favorite at rural parties[2][3].
- Patton's ethnicity has been the subject of speculation, with some suggesting he was of mixed African American, Native American, or even Mexican heritage[2].
- His tombstone in Indianola, Mississippi, reads: 'The Voice of the Delta – The Foremost Performer of Early Mississippi Blues Whose Songs Became Cornerstones of American Music'[2].
