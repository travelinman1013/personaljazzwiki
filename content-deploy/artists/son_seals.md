## Biography
Frank 'Son' Seals (August 14, 1942 – December 20, 2004) was an influential American electric blues guitarist, singer, and songwriter, recognized for his fiery guitar work and raw, passionate vocals. Born in Osceola, Arkansas, Seals was raised in the vibrant musical environment of his father Jim 'Son' Seals's juke joint, the Dipsy Doodle, where he was exposed to legendary blues musicians from a young age. By age 13, he was already performing as a drummer with visiting artists, and by 18, he was leading his own band and had switched to guitar, developing a distinctive, high-energy style shaped by the blues greats who frequented his father's club.[1][2][4]

Seals's early career included stints as a drummer for Albert King (notably appearing on King's 'Live Wire/Blues Power' album) and as a guitarist with Earl Hooker. In 1971, following his father's death, Seals moved to Chicago, where he quickly became a fixture on the city's blues scene, playing alongside Junior Wells, Buddy Guy, and Hound Dog Taylor. Discovered by Alligator Records founder Bruce Iglauer, Seals released his debut album, 'The Son Seals Blues Band,' in 1973, followed by the critically acclaimed 'Midnight Son' in 1977. His intense, original songwriting and electrifying live performances earned him a reputation as one of the leading voices in Chicago blues, and he toured internationally, helping to keep the tradition alive through the 1970s, 80s, and beyond.[2][3][4]

Son Seals's legacy is marked by his role in revitalizing the gritty, Southern-rooted Chicago blues sound at a time when many contemporaries were moving toward funk, soul, or rock. Over his career, he recorded eight albums for Alligator Records, won three W.C. Handy Blues Awards, and was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 2009. His music has influenced a new generation of blues and rock musicians, and his songs continue to be celebrated by artists and fans alike.[1][2][3][7]
