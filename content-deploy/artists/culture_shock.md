## Biography
James Pountney, professionally known as Culture Shock, is a British drum and bass DJ and producer who has played a significant role in shaping the modern sound of the genre. Born on January 23, he discovered drum and bass in 1996 through London's pirate radio stations, which inspired him to build a home studio and begin producing his own tracks. His early work culminated in the release of 'The Vega EP' on Moving Shadow in 2004, marking his formal entry into the drum and bass scene.

Culture Shock's career gained momentum when he signed with the influential RAM Records in 2006, a label led by Andy C. His debut RAM release, 'The Third Stage' EP (2007), included collaborations such as 'Rework' with the Brookes Brothers, showcasing his knack for blending melodic elements with energetic rhythms. After a brief hiatus, he returned in 2014 with remixes and original tracks that reaffirmed his innovative approach. The 2015 single 'City Lights,' featuring Bryn Christopher, became a staple on UK radio and highlighted his crossover appeal. Subsequent releases like the 'Transit' EP (2015), 'Sequence' (2019), and 'Sequel' (2022) further cemented his reputation for high-quality, forward-thinking drum and bass.

Known for his dynamic DJ sets and polished productions, Culture Shock has maintained a strong presence in the electronic music scene. His ability to innovate while staying true to the genre's underground roots has made him a respected figure among both peers and fans, contributing to the ongoing evolution of drum and bass.
