## Biography
Gregory Agid, a jazz clarinetist and saxophonist, was born in San Antonio, Texas, lived briefly in Dallas, and grew up in Honolulu, Hawaii, until age 12. His mother is from Switzerland and his father from Paris; at age seven, while visiting family in Switzerland, he discovered the clarinet at his uncle's house, receiving his first instrument that Christmas. In 2000, at age 12, his family moved to New Orleans, where he immersed himself in jazz at Louis Armstrong Jazz Camp under teachers like Alvin Batiste, Kidd Jordan, and Clyde Kerr. Despite pressures to play saxophone, Agid chose clarinet for its beautiful tone, inspired by Batiste's avant-garde and modern jazz approach.[1][3]

Agid studied classical music at Loyola University and earned a jazz studies degree from the University of New Orleans. He received a grant to study with Eddie Daniels in 2005 and has since built a prolific career, performing with GRAMMY winner Michael Buble, Delfeayo Marsalis’ Uptown Jazz Orchestra (since 2011, including South Africa tours), Ellis Marsalis, Branford Marsalis, Herlin Riley, and the New Orleans Jazz Orchestra. Leading his Gregory Agid Quartet, he released albums like Mystery Blues, Words Are Not Enough (featuring Harold Battiste's 'Nevermore'), and Jamz. His style blends traditional jazz excellence with modern innovation, establishing him as the preeminent jazz clarinetist of his generation.[1][5]

Beyond performing, Agid is a dedicated educator, teaching at the University of New Orleans, Tulane, and privately. With drummer Darrian Douglas, he co-founded the Second Line Arts Collective, a non-profit offering jazz summer camps for ages 14-21, focusing on music and business skills, continuing Alvin Batiste's mentorship legacy. Based in New Orleans, his strong social media presence positions him as a clarinet community leader.[1]
