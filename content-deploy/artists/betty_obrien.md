## Biography
Betty O'Brien is a lesser-known but highly respected figure in the Northern Soul scene, active primarily in the early 1960s. She recorded only a handful of singles between 1961 and 1964, yet her work has become a cult favorite among collectors and soul enthusiasts. Her debut single, 'She'll Be Gone,' released on the Burnetts Of Detroit label, is particularly celebrated for its driving rhythm and emotive vocal delivery, embodying the raw, heartfelt style that characterizes Northern Soul.

Managed by the influential Clyde Otis, who was also known for his work with Liberty Records artist Timi Yuro, O'Brien's brief career was marked by both promise and frustration. Despite her evident talent and the quality of her recordings—including a cover of 'Money Honey'—she did not achieve mainstream success, and her output was limited to just three singles over three years. Nevertheless, her music has endured, finding new audiences through the Northern Soul revival and rare soul collectors.

O'Brien's style is rooted in classic R&B and early soul, with powerful, expressive vocals and arrangements that reflect the influence of the Detroit sound. While little is documented about her later life, her recordings remain staples at Northern Soul events, and her legacy is preserved through the ongoing appreciation of her rare singles.
