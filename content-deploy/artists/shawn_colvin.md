## Biography
Shawn Colvin, born January 10, 1956, in Vermillion, South Dakota, is a celebrated American singer-songwriter renowned for her introspective lyrics and folk-pop sound. Raised partly in Illinois, she began playing guitar at age ten and made her first public performance at fifteen. Colvin attended Southern Illinois University but left to pursue music, performing in folk and rock clubs across Illinois, Texas, California, and New York throughout the late 1970s and early 1980s. After stints in bands like the Dixie Diesels and the Buddy Miller Band, she became involved with New York's Fast Folk cooperative, which helped launch her solo career.

Colvin's breakthrough came with her debut album 'Steady On' (1989), which won the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Recording. She continued to build her reputation with albums like 'Fat City' (1992) and 'Cover Girl' (1994), but it was 'A Few Small Repairs' (1996) that brought her mainstream success, earning her two Grammy Awards for the hit single 'Sunny Came Home.' Her music blends folk, pop, and country influences, marked by confessional songwriting and melodic craftsmanship. Over her four-decade career, Colvin has released more than a dozen albums, earning critical acclaim and influencing a generation of singer-songwriters.
