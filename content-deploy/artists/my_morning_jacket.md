## Biography
My Morning Jacket is an American indie rock band formed in 1998 in Louisville, Kentucky, by singer-guitarist Jim James (born James Olliges, Jr.), who started it as an outlet for introspective songs rejected by his prior band. James adopted his stage name for open-mic billing ease, inspired by a Western gunslinger vibe, and drew early influences from Nirvana and R.E.M. after a heavy-metal phase. He recruited cousin Johnny Quaid on guitar, college friend bassist 'Two-Tone Tommy' Blankenship, and keyboardist Danny Cash, releasing debut album *The Tennessee Fire* (1999) and *At Dawn* (2001) on indie label Darla Records after a creatively packaged demo letter secured their interest. The band built a cult following, especially in the Netherlands and Belgium, through relentless touring.[1][2]

Breakthrough came with 2003's *It Still Moves* on ATO Records, co-produced by John Leckie, following drummer Patrick Hallahan (James' childhood friend) joining the lineup; this era marked their shift to alt-country, folk rock, psychedelic, and jam band styles with reverb-soaked sound and epic live shows. Lineup changes ensued as Quaid and Cash departed in 2004 due to touring fatigue, replaced by guitarist Carl Broemel and keyboardist Bo Koster, enabling albums like *Z* (2005), *Evil Urges* (2008), *Circuital* (2011, recorded in a Louisville church gym), and *The Waterfall* (2015). Hits like 'One Big Holiday' dominated college radio, and 'I'm Amazed' hit #6 on Billboard's Triple A chart; their Bonnaroo performances, including a legendary rainy 2004 set and 2008 headliner, cemented their reputation as live legends.[1][2][6][7]

Over 25+ years, My Morning Jacket has sustained creative evolution while rooted in Southern rock, jazz, country, and folk, with Blankenship as the only other original member alongside James, Broemel, Hallahan, and Koster. Despite hiatuses and internal tensions thawing by 2019 with Red Rocks shows, they remain a cultural force known for community-building and boundary-pushing artistry.[3][4][5][7]
