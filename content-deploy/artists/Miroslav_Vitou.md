## Biography
Miroslav Vitouš, born December 6, 1947 in Prague, Czech Republic, is a renowned jazz bassist and composer whose innovative approach has left a lasting mark on jazz and fusion music. He began his musical journey studying violin at age six before transitioning to the double bass, quickly demonstrating prodigious talent. His early classical training and exposure to jazz in Prague set the stage for his future explorations in improvisation and genre-blending[1][2].

Vitouš moved to the United States in the late 1960s after winning a scholarship to the Berklee College of Music, where he was influenced by leading jazz educators and musicians. He soon became a sought-after collaborator, performing with jazz luminaries such as Chick Corea, Herbie Hancock, and Miles Davis. In 1970, Vitouš co-founded the legendary jazz fusion band Weather Report alongside Joe Zawinul and Wayne Shorter, helping to pioneer a new sound that fused jazz, funk, and world music elements[3]. His melodic bass lines and adventurous improvisations were central to the band's early identity.

Throughout his career, Vitouš has released numerous solo albums and worked as a bandleader, educator, and composer. His style is distinguished by its lyrical phrasing, technical mastery, and openness to experimentation, bridging free jazz, fusion, and classical influences. Vitouš's legacy is evident in the generations of bassists and jazz musicians who cite his work as foundational to modern jazz.
