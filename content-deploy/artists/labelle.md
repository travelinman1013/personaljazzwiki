## Biography
Labelle was an influential American soul and funk trio that emerged from the Philadelphia music scene in the early 1960s. The group originated from two rival girl groups, the Ordettes and the Del-Capris, merging to form what would become Patti LaBelle and the Bluebelles. The founding members were Patti LaBelle (born Patricia Louise Holt), Nona Hendryx, Sarah Dash, and Cindy Birdsong. Initially, the group achieved success with doo-wop and R&B ballads such as 'Down the Aisle (The Wedding Song)' and 'You'll Never Walk Alone,' earning them national recognition and the nickname 'Apollo Sweethearts' after their performances at Harlem's Apollo Theater.

After Cindy Birdsong departed in 1967 to join The Supremes, the group faced a period of stagnation. Under the guidance of manager Vicki Wickham, they reinvented themselves in 1971 as Labelle, adopting a bold, futuristic image and a progressive soul sound that incorporated elements of rock, funk, and glam. Their willingness to address provocative themes and experiment with their musical style set them apart from other female groups of the era. Labelle's breakthrough came in 1974 with the release of 'Nightbirds,' featuring the chart-topping single 'Lady Marmalade.' This hit propelled them into mainstream success, making them the first Black vocal group to appear on the cover of Rolling Stone and the first contemporary pop group to perform at the Metropolitan Opera House.

Labelle's legacy is marked by their innovative approach to music and performance, blending genres and challenging conventions in both sound and image. Their influence extended beyond their own recordings, paving the way for future generations of female artists in R&B, soul, and pop. After disbanding in 1977 due to creative differences, each member pursued successful solo careers, most notably Patti LaBelle, who became known as the 'Godmother of Soul.'
