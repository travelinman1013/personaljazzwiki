## Biography
Motel Radio is an indie rock band from New Orleans, Louisiana, known for warm harmonies, melodic guitar work, and an easygoing, sun‑washed sound that blends indie rock, folk, and retro‑soul inflections.[1][3][5] The group formed in 2014 at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, when Texas natives and college roommates Ian Wellman and Winston Triolo began writing songs together and singing close harmonies at campus parties.[2][4][8] Their relaxed, beachy vocal style and early folk‑leaning material quickly resonated with fellow students, and the pair soon expanded into a full band with Andrew Pancamo on bass and Eric Lloyd on drums, relocating activity to nearby New Orleans, where the city’s eclectic musical culture helped shape their developing sound.[1][2][3][4]

The band generated early buzz with their debut EP *Days & Nights* (2015), which established their reputation in New Orleans and landed them support slots for national acts such as Kurt Vile and Drive‑By Truckers, as well as appearances at major festivals including Firefly, New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, and Voodoo.[2][3][5][7] They followed with *Desert Surf Films* (2016), recorded at Dockside Studios in Lafayette, Louisiana, where experienced engineers helped the band refine their sonic identity, and in 2016 they were named “Best Emerging Artist” at New Orleans’ Big Easy Awards, cementing their status on the regional scene.[2][3][5] Their first full‑length album, *Siesta Del Sol* (2019), inspired in part by a trip to Marfa, Texas, broadened their palette with more expansive, hypnotic textures and supported a 31‑city U.S. tour that grew their national following.[2][5]

In the years that followed, Motel Radio increasingly focused on self‑production and sonic experimentation, aiming to become more self‑sufficient in the studio.[5] Their sophomore LP *The Garden* was recorded partly at a fishing camp south of New Orleans with engineer Ross Farbe (Video Age, Esther Rose) and partly through remote sessions the band engineered themselves, embracing synths, samples, and modern production tools to expand beyond their original folk‑centric roots while retaining their melodic core.[4][5] As adult life pulled members across different states—Wellman moving to San Francisco and Triolo to Portland—the band learned to balance personal growth with creative collaboration, channeling these experiences into introspective songwriting that often meditates on change, distance, and resilience.[4][5] Though still a relatively young act, Motel Radio has carved out a distinct place within contemporary indie rock through consistent touring, thoughtful lyricism, and a quietly evolving sound that continues to attract a devoted, grassroots audience.[2][3][4][5]

## Fun Facts
- Motel Radio originally formed at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge not as a formal band, but as a casual songwriting and harmony project between college roommates Ian Wellman and Winston Triolo, playing songs for friends at campus parties before ever hitting a proper venue.[2][4]
- The band’s transition from local college shows to the national stage was catalyzed when manager Ron Richard "discovered" them and began securing slots at major festivals like SXSW, New Orleans Jazz Fest, Firefly, and Voodoo, dramatically accelerating their exposure.[2]
- Their debut EP *Days & Nights* grew out of a period when the members were in a "deep folk phase," learning songcraft from classic folk standards before later pushing themselves toward more distinctive, experimental arrangements.[3][5]
- To record their sophomore LP *The Garden*, Motel Radio tracked part of the album in an old fishing camp south of New Orleans and finished the rest remotely, teaching themselves engineering and embracing synths, samples, and plug‑ins to expand their sound beyond their original folk‑rock roots.[4][5]
