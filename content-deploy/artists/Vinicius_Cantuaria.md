## Biography
Vinicius Cantuária is a celebrated Brazilian singer, guitarist, composer, drummer, and percussionist, renowned for his contributions to bossa nova, Brazilian jazz, and MPB (Música Popular Brasileira). Born in Manaus, Amazonas in 1951, Cantuária grew up in Rio de Janeiro, where he absorbed the vibrant musical culture that would shape his career. His early years coincided with the global rise of bossa nova, which deeply influenced his artistic sensibility. In the 1980s, he led the influential Brazilian rock band O Terço and released several successful albums, establishing himself as a versatile figure in Brazil’s music scene.[1][3][5][6]

Cantuária’s songwriting prowess came to the fore with hits like "Lua e Estrela" (famously recorded by Caetano Veloso in 1981), "So Você," and "Coisa Linda," each becoming MPB classics and selling millions of copies. In 1994, seeking new artistic horizons, he relocated to New York City, where he became a prominent figure in the downtown jazz and contemporary music scenes. There, he pioneered a style often called "Nova Bossa Nova," blending traditional Brazilian forms with jazz, avant-garde, and pop influences. His acclaimed solo albums, including "Sol na Cara," "Ê Vinicius," and "Horse & Fish," feature collaborations with leading musicians from both Brazil and New York, further cementing his legacy as an innovator and bridge-builder between musical worlds.[1][3][4][6]

Cantuária’s music is noted for its melodic sophistication, rhythmic subtlety, and emotional depth. He is celebrated as a brilliant interpreter of the works of Antonio Carlos Jobim and João Gilberto, and his own compositions have become standards in the Brazilian repertoire. Over more than four decades, Cantuária has influenced generations of musicians, both in Brazil and internationally, through his recordings, collaborations, and live performances.[3][4][5]
