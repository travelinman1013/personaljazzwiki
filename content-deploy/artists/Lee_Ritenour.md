## Biography
Lee Ritenour, born January 11, 1952, in Los Angeles, California, is a Grammy-winning guitarist renowned for his work in jazz, jazz fusion, and smooth jazz. Picking up the guitar at age eight, Ritenour was already performing professionally by his teens, playing his first major session at just 16 with the Mamas and the Papas, who nicknamed him 'Captain Fingers' for his technical prowess. His early exposure to a vibrant Los Angeles music scene, combined with formal studies under classical guitarist Christopher Parkening at the University of Southern California, laid the foundation for a career marked by versatility and innovation.[2][6][8]

By the 1970s, Ritenour had become one of the most in-demand session guitarists in Los Angeles, contributing to more than 3,000 recordings across genres, including work with Steely Dan, Pink Floyd, Barbra Streisand, Aretha Franklin, and Quincy Jones. As a solo artist, he released over 40 albums, including the influential 'First Course' and 'The Captain's Journey.' Ritenour's collaborative spirit led to the formation of Fourplay in 1991 alongside Bob James, Nathan East, and Harvey Mason, a group that became a cornerstone of contemporary jazz. His projects often blend jazz with pop, rock, Brazilian, and funk influences, and he is celebrated for both his technical mastery and melodic sensibility.[2][6][8]

Ritenour's legacy is defined by his genre-crossing collaborations, his role in shaping the sound of contemporary jazz, and his mentorship of emerging guitarists through initiatives like the 6 String Theory Competition. His impact is reflected in numerous accolades, including a Grammy Award, 19 Grammy nominations, and a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Canadian SJ Awards, cementing his status as one of the most influential guitarists of his generation.[2][3][8]
