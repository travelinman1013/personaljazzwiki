## Biography
Ikebe Shakedown is a Brooklyn-based instrumental ensemble known for their dynamic blend of afrobeat, jazz funk, cinematic soul, and deep disco. The group was formed in the late 2000s by musicians who initially met at Bard College, where much of the rhythm section played together in various projects before relocating to New York City. Bassist Vince Chiarito was instrumental in assembling the band, which quickly expanded to include a robust horn section and began performing across Brooklyn and Manhattan, rapidly establishing themselves within the city's vibrant live music scene[1][7].

Drawing inspiration from 1970s African funk, 1960s American soul, and classic film soundtracks, Ikebe Shakedown has developed a signature style they describe as 'hard-hitting afro-funk.' Their music is strictly instrumental, characterized by tight grooves, lush horn arrangements, and a cinematic quality that evokes both dancefloor energy and evocative storytelling. Over the years, the band has released several acclaimed albums, including 'Hard Steppin',' 'Stone by Stone,' and 'The Way Home,' each showcasing their evolving collaborative songwriting process and deepening their reputation for energetic, immersive live performances[2][3][4].

Ikebe Shakedown's legacy lies in their ability to bridge genres and eras, channeling the spirit of afrobeat pioneers like Fela Kuti and the soul of classic Motown while pushing the boundaries of modern instrumental music. Their commitment to groove, ensemble interplay, and creative exploration has made them a staple of the New York funk and soul scene, influencing a new generation of instrumental bands.
