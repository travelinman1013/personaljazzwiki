## Biography
The Trammps are an American disco and soul **band** from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, widely regarded as one of the first acts to crystallize the sound of disco from the roots of gospel-inflected soul and R&B.[4][5] Emerging from the 1960s Philadelphia soul scene, the musicians first worked together under names such as **The Volcanos** and **The Moods** before settling on The Trammps in the early 1970s.[1][3] Early line‑ups featured Gene Faith as lead vocalist alongside key figures including drummer/vocalist **Earl Young**, vocalist **Jimmy Ellis**, guitarist **Norman Harris**, guitarist **Dennis Harris**, keyboardist **Ron Kersey**, organist **John Hart**, guitarist/vocalist **Harold Wade**, bassist **Stanley Wade**, and drummer **Michael Thomas**.[1][3] They began issuing singles in 1972 on Buddah Records, scoring an R&B hit and UK northern soul favorite with their exuberant cover of Judy Garland’s “**Zing! Went the Strings of My Heart**,” followed by further success with “**Hold Back the Night**,” which became a Top 5 UK hit on its 1975 re‑release.[1][2]

As disco emerged from East Coast clubs in the early 1970s, The Trammps were among the first soul groups to fully embrace and shape the new style, marrying Philadelphia string arrangements and gospel‑styled vocals with a driving four‑on‑the‑floor beat pioneered by Earl Young’s drumming.[2][3] They released their self‑titled debut album in 1975 and moved through labels including Buddah, Philadelphia International, and ultimately **Atlantic Records**, where they cut their defining track, **“Disco Inferno.”**[1][2][3] Initially released in 1976, “Disco Inferno” exploded after its inclusion on the 1977 *Saturday Night Fever* soundtrack, reaching the U.S. pop Top 20, climbing the R&B charts, and later winning a Grammy Award as part of the blockbuster soundtrack’s triumph.[1][2] The Trammps continued to chart on R&B and disco playlists throughout the 1970s, and their work helped bridge classic 1960s soul to the full‑blown disco era—an influence later recognized when “Disco Inferno” was inducted into the **Dance Music Hall of Fame** in 2005.[1] Though tastes shifted after the disco backlash, the band’s recordings remained staples of dancefloors and film/TV soundtracks, and various touring line‑ups of The Trammps have continued to perform internationally, sustaining their legacy as one of disco’s most soulful and foundational groups.[1][2][4][5]

## Musical Connections

### Mentors/Influences
- [[philadelphia_soul_and_randb_tradition_e.g._motownstax-era_soul|Philadelphia soul and R&B tradition (e.g., Motown/Stax-era soul)]] - The Trammps developed within the broader 1960s soul movement shaped by labels like Motown, Stax, and Atlantic, drawing on gospel-tinged vocals, orchestrated arrangements, and R&B grooves that defined Philadelphia soul. (Early singles such as “Zing! Went the Strings of My Heart” and “Hold Back the Night,” which adapt classic soul songcraft to a more dance-focused context.) [1960s–early 1970s[2]]
- [[east_coast_nightclub_disco_scene_new_york_and_philadelphia|East Coast nightclub disco scene (New York and Philadelphia)]] - The group was influenced by the emerging disco sound born on dance floors in New York and Philadelphia, which encouraged them to pivot from straight soul into extended, rhythm-driven dance records. (“Trammps Disco Theme,” early 1970s disco singles and club mixes.) [Early–mid 1970s[2][4]]

### Key Collaborators
- [[earl_young|Earl Young]] - Founding member, drummer, and vocalist whose innovative four-on-the-floor drumming style became a blueprint for disco rhythm sections; central to the band’s recordings and live sound. (Core Trammps catalog including “Zing! Went the Strings of My Heart,” “Hold Back the Night,” “Trammps Disco Theme,” and “Disco Inferno.”) [Late 1960s–1970s (and later touring incarnations)[1][3]]
- [[jimmy_ellis|Jimmy Ellis]] - Lead vocalist whose gospel-inspired, soaring tenor was a key signature of The Trammps’ sound, particularly in their disco-era hits. (Lead vocals on major singles such as “Disco Inferno” and other Atlantic-era releases.) [Early 1970s–late 1970s[1][2][3]]
- [[norman_harris|Norman Harris]] - Guitarist and vocalist, part of the core Philadelphia session community; contributed to the group’s arrangements and distinctive Philly soul–meets–disco sound. (Guitar and arrangements across early Trammps recordings and disco-era albums.) [Early–late 1970s[1][3]]
- [[ron_ronald_kersey|Ron (Ronald) Kersey]] - Keyboardist and songwriter/arranger who helped shape the harmonic and textural palette of the band’s recordings. (Keyboards and arrangements on 1970s Trammps releases, including “Disco Inferno.”) [Early–late 1970s[1][3]]
- [[atlantic_records_and_saturday_night_fever_production_team|Atlantic Records and *Saturday Night Fever* production team]] - Label and soundtrack collaborators who helped bring “Disco Inferno” to a global audience through its placement on the *Saturday Night Fever* album. (“Disco Inferno” as part of the *Saturday Night Fever* soundtrack.) [1976–1979[1][2]]

### Artists Influenced
- [[disco_and_dance_music_producers_and_vocal_groups_of_the_late_1970s_and_1980s|Disco and dance music producers and vocal groups of the late 1970s and 1980s]] - The Trammps’ combination of gospel-style lead vocals, group harmonies, and Earl Young’s steady four-on-the-floor drumming helped codify the disco template adopted by later disco, post-disco, and house producers. (“Disco Inferno” and the group’s mid-1970s disco singles, which became reference points for extended club mixes and rhythm-section arranging.) [Late 1970s–1980s and beyond[2][3][4]]
- [[film_and_television_music_supervisors_using_disco_as_cultural_shorthand|Film and television music supervisors using disco as cultural shorthand]] - Because “Disco Inferno” became an archetypal disco anthem, it has been repeatedly licensed for films and TV series, influencing how later generations associate certain visual tropes with disco-era sound. (Use of “Disco Inferno” on the *Saturday Night Fever* soundtrack and numerous subsequent soundtracks.) [Late 1970s–21st century[1][2][4]]
