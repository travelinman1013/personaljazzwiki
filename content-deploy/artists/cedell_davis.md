## Biography
CeDell Davis, born Ellis CeDell Davis on June 9, 1926, in Helena, Arkansas, emerged as a singular figure in American blues, renowned for his raw, expressive guitar style and indomitable spirit. Raised on a plantation, Davis was immersed in the Delta blues tradition from an early age, learning harmonica and guitar alongside childhood friends, including future bluesman Doctor Ross. At age ten, Davis contracted severe polio, which left him with limited use of his hands. Undeterred, he developed a unique slide guitar technique, using a table knife to fret the strings, giving his music a distinctive, metallic resonance that set him apart from his peers.

Davis began performing in Mississippi Delta nightclubs, and from 1953 to 1963, he played with legendary bluesman Robert Nighthawk. Despite suffering further adversity—his legs were broken in a 1957 club stampede, confining him to a wheelchair—Davis continued to perform, his hardships deeply informing his lyrics and sound. Relocating to Pine Bluff, Arkansas in the early 1960s, he remained active in the blues scene, though his recordings did not appear until the 1980s. Davis experienced a late-career renaissance in the 1990s and 2000s, releasing acclaimed albums on Fat Possum Records, collaborating with artists like Col. Bruce Hampton and members of R.E.M., and earning praise for his timeless approach to the blues. He died in Hot Springs, Arkansas, on September 27, 2017, at age 91, leaving a legacy as a resilient innovator who bridged the rural roots and modern evolution of the blues.
