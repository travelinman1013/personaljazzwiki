## Biography
George Russell (1923–2009) was an influential American jazz composer, bandleader, pianist, arranger, and theorist born on June 23, 1923, in Cincinnati, Ohio. Adopted shortly after birth, he developed an early passion for music, playing drums in ensembles and attending Wilberforce University on scholarship. He gigged with Benny Carter's band but shifted focus after hearing Max Roach and during a tuberculosis hospitalization in his early 20s, where he began studying music theory and composing his first pieces. Moving to New York in 1945, Russell immersed himself in the vibrant jazz scene, associating with innovators like Miles Davis, Charlie Parker, Gil Evans, Gerry Mulligan, and Thelonious Monk, whose ''Round Midnight inspired him profoundly.[1][2][3]

Russell's career breakthrough came with his groundbreaking Lydian Chromatic Concept of Tonal Organization, privately published in 1953, which revolutionized jazz harmony by prioritizing the Lydian scale over traditional major scales and influenced modal jazz pioneers like Miles Davis and John Coltrane. He composed landmark works such as 'Cubano Be, Cubano Bop' for Dizzy Gillespie's orchestra in 1947—the first major Afro-Cuban jazz fusion—and led innovative groups like his Jazz Workshop sextet, recording albums including Jazz Workshop (1956) with Bill Evans and Art Farmer. In 1964, dismayed by U.S. race relations, he relocated to Scandinavia, collaborating with emerging talents and teaching at Lund University before returning in 1969 to join the New England Conservatory under Gunther Schuller, where he taught for decades and formed the Living Time Orchestra in the late 1970s for global tours.[1][2][4][6]

Russell's style blended jazz, classical, and world music elements, emphasizing theoretical innovation over instrumental virtuosity. His legacy includes numerous awards, such as the NEA Jazz Masters Award in 1990, and enduring impact through compositions like The African Game (1985) and ensembles that nurtured future stars. He passed away on July 27, 2009, in Boston from Alzheimer's complications, leaving a profound mark as jazz's premier theorist.[1][2][5]

## Fun Facts
- During a 16-month tuberculosis hospitalization in 1945-46, Russell formulated the core ideas of his Lydian Chromatic Concept while unable to perform.
- 'Cubano Be, Cubano Bop,' co-composed with Dizzy Gillespie, premiered at Carnegie Hall in 1947 as the first major jazz-Afro-Cuban fusion.
- Russell worked a sales counter at Macy’s while finalizing his 1953 theory book, temporarily stepping away from active music-making.
- He lived in Scandinavia for five years starting 1964 partly due to frustration with U.S. race relations, teaching at Lund University.
