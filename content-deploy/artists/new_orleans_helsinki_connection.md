## Biography
New Orleans Helsinki Connection is a jazz ensemble originally formed by musicians from New Orleans, USA, and Helsinki, Finland, with the aim of blending traditional New Orleans jazz with a modern, youthful touch. The group emerged from longstanding collaborations among its members, who had performed together in various bands for years. In the summer of 2002, their dream of a joint band materialized with a successful three-week tour in Finland, marking the official birth of the ensemble. The band's early years were marked by international performances, including festivals in Norway and Finland, and a strong presence in the New Orleans jazz scene, appearing at events like the French Quarter Festival, Satchmo Fest, and the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival[1][2][3].

The group's debut album, 'At Last,' was released in April 2004, followed by extensive touring and radio play, particularly on New Orleans' WWOZ jazz station. Over time, the band evolved to become entirely New Orleans-based, though it retained its international flavor through its members and repertoire. In 2012, the band released 'Paradise On Earth,' featuring both regular and substitute musicians, and showcasing original compositions alongside jazz standards, gospel, blues, and classic New Orleans jazz numbers. The ensemble is led by trombonist Katja Toivola, with key members including Tricia Boutté (vocals), Leroy Jones (trumpet/vocals), Todd Duke (guitar), Paul Longstreth (piano), Nobu Ozaki (bass), and Thomas Rönnholm (drums)[1][3][5].

New Orleans Helsinki Connection is celebrated for its authentic yet innovative approach to New Orleans jazz, characterized by warm, genuine performances and strong musical camaraderie among its members. The band has contributed to clarifying misconceptions about New Orleans jazz, demonstrating its depth beyond the "riverboat-dixie" stereotype, and has built a legacy of cross-cultural musical exchange, inspiring audiences and musicians on both sides of the Atlantic[1][2].
