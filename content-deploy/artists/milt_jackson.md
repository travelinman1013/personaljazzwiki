## Biography
Milt Jackson, born January 1, 1923, in Detroit, Michigan, was an American jazz vibraphonist renowned for his soulful, blues-inflected style and his mastery of the vibraphone. Raised in a musically rich environment, Jackson began playing guitar at age seven and piano at eleven, later exploring violin, drums, and singing in gospel groups. His early exposure to church music shaped his relaxed, expressive approach to jazz, and at sixteen he was inspired to take up the vibraphone after hearing Lionel Hampton perform[4][1].

Jackson's professional breakthrough came when Dizzy Gillespie discovered him in Detroit and brought him into his sextet in 1945, followed by stints in Gillespie's big band. Throughout the late 1940s and early 1950s, Jackson collaborated with jazz luminaries such as Charlie Parker, Thelonious Monk, Howard McGhee, and Woody Herman. In 1952, he co-founded the Modern Jazz Quartet (MJQ) with John Lewis, Percy Heath, and Kenny Clarke, a group that became a cornerstone of modern jazz for over four decades. Jackson's lyrical improvisation and bluesy solos were central to the MJQ's sound, but he also recorded prolifically as a leader and sideman, working with artists like Miles Davis, Ray Charles, and Wes Montgomery[1][2][3][4].

Jackson's influence on jazz vibraphone was profound, setting a standard for expressiveness and swing that shaped generations of musicians. His compositions, including the classic "Bags' Groove," became jazz standards, and his legacy endures through his recordings and the countless vibraphonists he inspired. Jackson passed away from liver cancer on October 9, 1999, leaving behind a monumental contribution to jazz[1][4][5].
