## Biography
Bre Kennedy is an American singer, songwriter, and producer based in Nashville, Tennessee, known for **indie-pop** and **singer‑songwriter** music rooted in intimate storytelling and emotive, cinematic arrangements.[1][4][6] Originally from the West Coast, she moved to Los Angeles as a teenager and began her career behind the scenes, writing songs for other artists while working part-time jobs to support herself.[3][8] Her early years in LA honed both her craft and work ethic and eventually led to a publishing deal, opening the door for a transition from staff songwriter to recording artist in her own right.[3][7]

Seeking a deeper creative community and a place to grow as a writer and performer, Kennedy relocated from Los Angeles to **Nashville** in 2015.[7] There she developed a sound that blends **rich, timeless storytelling** with **effortless pop sensibilities**, placing her voice and lyrics at the center of lush yet restrained production.[1][4][6] She released a series of EPs and singles that built a steady following through word of mouth and live shows, then moved into full-length projects, including her debut album and later releases such as *Scream Over Everything* and the deeply personal project *The Alchemist*, which chronicles a season of emotional upheaval, grief, and self‑reconstruction following the breakup of a long-term relationship.[2][6] Critics and interviewers often highlight her vulnerability, dynamic vocal presence, and ability to turn personal experiences into universal narratives that resonate with fans of modern indie pop and folk‑leaning singer‑songwriters.[1][2][5]

Across her catalog, Kennedy’s musical style weaves together **indie pop**, **folk**, and classic **singer‑songwriter** traditions, with influences from both pop craft and literary storytelling.[1][4][6] She frequently frames her songs around themes of self-discovery, resilience, and coming‑of‑age in adulthood, treating songwriting as a form of emotional documentation and healing.[2][5] As a live performer, she has earned a reputation in Nashville and beyond for commanding, emotionally charged shows and has toured or shared stages with a variety of contemporary artists, gradually establishing herself as a distinctive voice in the current generation of Nashville‑based indie-pop and Americana‑adjacent songwriters.[5][6]

## Fun Facts
- Kennedy moved to Los Angeles at around 17 years old, juggling multiple part‑time jobs to afford rent while she wrote songs and pursued a publishing deal, effectively launching her professional songwriting career as a teenager.[3]
- Before stepping fully into her role as a solo artist, she spent her early career in LA primarily writing songs for other people to sing, which she later said helped her develop both her voice and perspective as a storyteller.[8]
- The album *The Alchemist* was written out of what Kennedy calls a “foundational demolition” in her life: the end of a nearly decade‑long relationship that spanned most of her twenties, leading her to document grief and transformation in real time rather than after the fact.[2]
- When she released her song “Jealous of Birds,” Kennedy was still working at a Nashville brewery; within about a week, she received a call about working with Sheryl Crow, marking a major turning point from service‑industry work to higher‑profile musical opportunities.[2]

- [[glennon_doyle_elizabeth_gilbert_rebecca_solnit_literary_influences|Glennon Doyle, Elizabeth Gilbert, Rebecca Solnit (literary influences)]] - Kennedy names these writers as major inspirations for *The Alchemist*, drawing on their books about dismantling identity and rebuilding the self to shape her own storytelling approach.[2] (Influenced lyrical themes and narrative arc of *The Alchemist*; specifically cites *Untamed* (Doyle), *Big Magic* (Gilbert), and *A Field Guide to Getting Lost* (Solnit) as works that ‘rocked’ her world.[2]) [Early 2020s during the writing and recording of *The Alchemist*]

- [[longtime_bandmates_unnamed_backing_band|Longtime bandmates (unnamed backing band)]] - Kennedy often records and performs with the same core group of bandmates who helped make her first record; she returned to this group for sessions on songs like “Willow,” emphasizing their importance to her sound and creative process.[2] (Her first full‑length record (title not specified in the cited interview) and later recordings including “Willow.”[2]) [From her debut full‑length through *The Alchemist* era (late 2010s–2020s)]
- [[stephen_wilson_jr|Stephen Wilson Jr.]] - Touring collaborator; Kennedy joined Stephen Wilson Jr. on tour, which she described as a creatively energizing period that preceded the completion of “The Alchemist.”[2] (Shared tour dates (performance collaboration rather than joint studio releases).[2]) [Shortly before finishing “The Alchemist” in the early 2020s]
