## Biography
AfroReggae, officially known as Grupo Cultural AfroReggae (GCAR), is a pioneering Brazilian cultural group and NGO founded in January 1993 in Rio de Janeiro. The group emerged in response to the violence and social exclusion prevalent in the city's favelas, particularly Vigário Geral, one of Rio's most notorious slum areas. Initially, AfroReggae began as a newspaper, AfroReggae Notícias, aimed at promoting black culture and engaging youth interested in genres such as reggae, soul, and hip-hop. The group quickly expanded by establishing its first community cultural center, offering workshops in dance, percussion, capoeira, and other arts as a means to provide alternatives to the drug trade and police oppression[3][7][8].

AfroReggae's musical style is rooted in a fusion of reggae, soul, hip-hop, and traditional Brazilian rhythms, reflecting the diverse cultural influences of its members and the communities they serve. Their music and social projects are deeply intertwined, using artistic expression as a tool for social transformation and empowerment. The group is recognized for its innovative approach to community engagement, offering cultural education and artistic opportunities to adolescents living in marginalized neighborhoods. Through these efforts, AfroReggae has played a significant role in strengthening citizenship and providing viable pathways away from violence for countless young people[3][7].

Over the years, AfroReggae has grown from a local initiative to an internationally recognized movement, inspiring similar projects worldwide. The group's legacy lies not only in its musical achievements but also in its commitment to social justice, cultural pride, and the empowerment of Brazil's urban youth. AfroReggae's work has been featured in global media and has influenced public policy, making it a model for arts-based social intervention[7][8].
