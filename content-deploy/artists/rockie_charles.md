## Biography
Rockie Charles, born Alfred Charles Merrick on November 14, 1942, in Boothville, Louisiana, learned guitar from his father, Earlington Merrick, a traveling bluesman who performed in segregated juke joints. His family relocated to New Orleans when he was 13, where he competed in talent contests alongside emerging artists like Ernie K-Doe and Aaron Neville. Dropping out of high school, Charles worked as a tugboat captain for decades while staying active in music, recording singles and backing southern soul icons such as O.V. Wright, Percy Sledge, Otis Redding, and Little Johnny Taylor.[1][2][5][6]

Charles earned the nickname 'President of Soul' from his early 1970s hit of the same name and released his debut full-length album *Born For You* in 1996, produced by Carlo Ditta of Orleans Records after Charles placed an ad in a local magazine. The album blended blues and New Orleans soul, featuring his versatile voice shifting from baritone to falsetto, funk guitar, Hammond B-3 organ, and original compositions like 'Old Black Joel' and 'I Like to Make Love When It’s Pouring Down Rain.' He later released *I Want First Class* before his death.[1][3]

Known for a style rooted in blues but expanded with soul, funk, and diverse influences from his backing work, Charles's music evoked Hi Records and Stax vibes while showcasing his guitar prowess and emotional depth. He passed away on March 12, 2010, in New Orleans at age 67, leaving a legacy as a hidden gem of southern soul rediscovered late in life.[1][2][3]
