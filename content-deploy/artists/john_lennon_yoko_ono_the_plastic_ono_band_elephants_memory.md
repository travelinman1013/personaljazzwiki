## Biography
John Lennon, born in Liverpool, England, rose to global fame as a founding member of The Beatles, one of the most influential bands in music history. After meeting avant-garde artist Yoko Ono in 1966, Lennon's artistic direction shifted dramatically. The two began a personal and creative partnership, marrying in 1969 and soon after forming the Plastic Ono Band—a conceptual, Fluxus-inspired project that blurred the lines between art and music, and between performer and audience[1]. The Plastic Ono Band was conceived by Ono as an 'imaginary band' of plastic objects and machines, but evolved into a rotating collective of musicians for Lennon and Ono's collaborative and solo works, allowing Lennon to step out from the shadow of The Beatles[1][2]. Their early releases were experimental, but by 1970, Lennon released 'John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band,' a raw, deeply personal album reflecting his psychological struggles and marking a stark departure from his Beatles work[3]. In 1971, after moving to New York, Lennon and Ono collaborated with the local band Elephant's Memory, recording under the name 'Plastic Ono Band with Elephant's Memory' and further expanding their fusion of art rock and political activism[1].

Lennon and Ono's work together was characterized by a commitment to peace, avant-garde experimentation, and the breaking down of musical and social conventions. Their 'Bed-Ins' for peace, the release of anthems like 'Give Peace a Chance,' and the integration of audience participation into the Plastic Ono Band concept were hallmarks of their collaborative ethos[1][2]. Lennon's murder in 1980 cut short their partnership, but Ono has continued to champion their shared vision, including reviving the Plastic Ono Band with their son Sean in the 2000s[1]. Their legacy endures not only in music but in their unwavering advocacy for peace and artistic freedom.

## Fun Facts
- The name 'Plastic Ono Band' was coined by John Lennon after Yoko Ono described her idea for an art exhibition where the 'band' would be made of plastic stands with tape recorders instead of human musicians[1][2].
- The recording of 'Give Peace a Chance' during their Montreal Bed-In was intentionally credited to the Plastic Ono Band to emphasize that everyone present—and by extension, everyone in the world—was part of the band[1][2].
- The original Plastic Ono Band was a multimedia art installation featuring perspex columns with tape recorders, TVs, and light shows, set up in the Apple press office in 1969[1].
- After Lennon's death, Yoko Ono revived the Plastic Ono Band with their son Sean, releasing new music and touring internationally in the 2000s and 2010s[1].
