## Biography
Susannah McCorkle (January 1, 1946 – May 19, 2001) was an American jazz vocalist and writer, born in Berkeley, California. Initially studying languages at the University of California, she pursued a career in translation in Europe, living in Paris and later Italy. Her life took a decisive turn in Paris in 1970 when, on the verge of a translation career with the Common Market, she heard a Billie Holiday record and decided to become a singer instead. She moved to London in 1972, where she began performing regularly in clubs and recorded her debut album, launching a career built on the bandstand rather than formal musical training.

McCorkle became known for her direct, unadorned singing style and quiet intensity, specializing in the Great American Songbook and later exploring Brazilian and Latin American repertoire. She recorded a series of albums for Inner City Records before signing with Concord Records, for which she made about a dozen albums, including notable works like Sabia, I’ll Take Romance, From Bessie To Brazil, and her final studio album, Hearts and Minds. A meticulous researcher of her material, she often unearthed lesser-known songs and sang in multiple languages. Despite her artistic success and critical admiration, McCorkle struggled with depression and tragically died by suicide in 2001 at age 55. Her legacy endures through a rich body of recordings that showcase her interpretive skill and emotional honesty.

## Fun Facts
- McCorkle had no formal musical training and learned her craft entirely on the bandstand, which sometimes made communication with musicians challenging.
- She was multilingual, having studied Italian and other languages, and sang in English, Portuguese, and Italian on her Brazilian-themed album Sabia.
- Her debut album, The Music of Harry Warren (1976), featured a top British jazz band including altoist Bruce Turner and pianist Keith Ingham.
- McCorkle was also a writer of fiction and journalism; her personal papers at the New York Public Library include unpublished novellas and a memoir of her early singing career.
