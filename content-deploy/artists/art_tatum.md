## Biography
Art Tatum, born Arthur Tatum, Jr. on October 13, 1909, in Toledo, Ohio, was a prodigious jazz pianist whose technical virtuosity and harmonic innovation made him a towering figure in 20th-century music. Visually impaired from childhood, Tatum began his musical journey as a violinist before turning to the piano at age thirteen, largely teaching himself and displaying an early aptitude that quickly set him apart. He received some formal training at the Toledo School of Music, but his interests gravitated toward jazz, particularly inspired by Fats Waller. By his late teens, Tatum was performing on local radio and soon had his own show, establishing a reputation for his dazzling technique and improvisational prowess.

In 1932, Tatum moved to New York City, where he rapidly gained acclaim through his solo performances and legendary 'cutting contests' with other top pianists, never losing a single one. His 1933 recording of 'Tiger Rag' stunned the jazz world with its breakneck tempo and complex runs. Throughout the 1930s and 1940s, Tatum recorded extensively and toured widely, forming a celebrated trio in 1943 with guitarist Tiny Grimes and bassist Slam Stewart. His improvisational style was marked by intricate reharmonizations, rapid-fire runs, and a stride-influenced left hand, influencing the harmonic language of modern jazz. Tatum continued to record prolifically, especially after signing with Norman Granz in the 1950s, until his death in Los Angeles on November 5, 1956. His legacy endures as one of the most influential and technically gifted pianists in jazz history.
