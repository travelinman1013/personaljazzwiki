## Biography
Sounds of Blackness, a vocal and instrumental ensemble from Minneapolis/St. Paul, Minnesota, originated in 1969 at Macalester College as the Macalester College Black Voices, founded by Russell Knighton to continue the legacy of Duke Ellington by presenting all styles of Black music. In 1971, Gary Hines, a junior at the college from Yonkers, New York, took over as musical director during his sophomore year, renaming the group Sounds of Blackness and expanding its repertoire to embrace the full scope of African-American music, including gospel, spirituals, jazz, blues, R&B, and more. The ensemble independently released early albums like *Images of Blackness* (1974), *Images of Blackness II* (1976), and *The Night Before Christmas* (1978), focusing on cultural education and empowerment through diverse Black musical traditions.[1][2][3][4]

Their commercial breakthrough came in 1991 with a signing to A&M/Perspective Records, debuting with *The Evolution of Gospel*, which blended genres and sparked controversy in the gospel community as Hines emphasized they were a Black music group of Christians rather than strictly a gospel act. The group achieved widespread acclaim, earning three Grammy Awards, three Stellar Awards, an Emmy nomination, and performing at the White House in 1999, while later signing with Zinc Records for self-produced projects like *Reconciliation*. Their sound evolved into an inspired mix of urban gospel, R&B, jazz, hip-hop, soul, and spirituals, maintaining a mission to glorify God through all styles of Black music.[1][2][4][7]

Over five decades, Sounds of Blackness has become a cultural institution, performing worldwide and emphasizing the comprehensive African-American music experience, with Hines' vision drawing directly from Ellington's multifaceted approach to Black cultural sounds.[3][6][7]

## Fun Facts
- Gary Hines began his musical training in a drum & bugle corps (Samuel H. Dow Drum Corps, American Legion #1017) in Yonkers, New York, before leading Sounds of Blackness.[2]
- The group turned down multiple major label deals in the 1970s-1980s because labels wanted them to change their name (e.g., to 'Sound of Music') and limit their diverse style.[1]
- Sounds of Blackness was the first gospel choir to blend genres with traditional gospel music, making it acceptable in the industry, per critics and fans.[2]
- They performed in the White House Christmas program in 1999.[2]
