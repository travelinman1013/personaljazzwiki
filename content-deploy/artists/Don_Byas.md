## Biography
Don Byas, born Carlos Wesley Byas on October 21, 1912, in Muskogee, Oklahoma, was a pioneering American tenor saxophonist whose career bridged the swing and bebop eras. Raised in a musical family—his mother played piano and his father clarinet—Byas received classical training on violin, clarinet, and alto saxophone before switching to tenor sax in the early 1930s. He began performing in local bands as a teenager and led his own college ensemble at Langston College before moving to the West Coast, where he played with prominent swing bands led by Lionel Hampton, Eddie Barefield, and Buck Clayton.

Byas's big break came in 1941 when he succeeded Lester Young as the tenor saxophone soloist in the Count Basie Orchestra, where his solos on tracks like 'Harvard Blues' became highly regarded. Throughout the 1940s, he collaborated with bebop innovators such as Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker, experimenting with new harmonic and rhythmic concepts while maintaining a strong swing foundation. His 1945 duets with bassist Slam Stewart are considered milestones in the evolution of jazz saxophone technique. In 1946, Byas moved to Europe with Don Redman's band and settled there permanently, becoming a major figure in the European jazz scene and collaborating with both American and European musicians until his death in Amsterdam in 1972.

Byas's playing was characterized by a rich, expressive tone and a sophisticated harmonic approach, blending the robust sound of Coleman Hawkins with forward-looking bebop phrasing. Though his long residence in Europe limited his visibility in the United States, his influence on tenor saxophone playing was profound, inspiring generations of jazz musicians and earning him posthumous recognition, including induction into the Oklahoma Jazz Hall of Fame.
