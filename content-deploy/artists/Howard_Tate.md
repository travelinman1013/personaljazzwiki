## Biography
Howard Tate (August 13, 1939 – December 2, 2011) was an American soul singer and songwriter whose powerful tenor voice and emotionally charged performances made him a cult figure in classic soul. Born in Eberton, Georgia, and raised in Philadelphia, Tate was encouraged by his Baptist minister father to sing in church. By age 10, he had formed a gospel trio with his cousins, and soon joined the Gainors, a local gospel group that performed throughout Philadelphia. In 1955, the Gainors were signed to Mercury Records, but their doo-wop recordings failed to gain traction, leading Tate to join pianist Bill Doggett’s band for several years before returning to Philadelphia.[1]

Tate’s career took off in the mid-1960s when he began working with producer Jerry Ragovoy, who recognized Tate’s unique vocal talent and signed him to Verve Records. Their collaboration produced a string of soul classics, including "Ain't Nobody Home" and "Get It While You Can," the latter later covered by Janis Joplin. Despite critical acclaim and tours with stars like Sam Cooke and Wilson Pickett, Tate never achieved major commercial success and spent much of his career performing on the "chitlin' circuit." After leaving the music business in the 1980s and struggling with addiction and homelessness, Tate experienced a religious conversion in 1994 and became a preacher, helping others overcome addiction.[1][2]

A chance reconnection with soul fans and Jerry Ragovoy in 2001 led to Tate’s celebrated comeback, culminating in the album "Rediscovered" (2003), which showcased his enduring vocal power and artistry. Tate’s style blended gospel fervor with bluesy grit and witty lyricism, earning him respect among soul aficionados and musicians. He passed away in 2011 from complications of multiple myeloma and leukemia, leaving behind a legacy as one of soul’s "great lost" voices.[1][2]
