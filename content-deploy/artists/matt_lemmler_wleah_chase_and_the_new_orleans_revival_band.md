## Biography
Matt Lemmler is a New Orleans-based pianist, vocalist, composer, arranger, educator, and producer who emerged from the birthplace of jazz with a deeply original musical voice. Raised in the Lower 9th Ward just blocks from the home of legendary pianist Fats Domino, Lemmler grew up in a profoundly musical household where jazz and classical piano were played constantly. His father, Richard Lemmler Sr., was a retired professional musician, and his brothers Richard Jr. and Michael (also a noted New Orleans pianist-bandleader) contributed to an environment where music was perpetual. After earning a Bachelor of Music from Loyola University and a Master's degree from Manhattan School of Music in NYC, Lemmler toured for four years with Andrew Lloyd Webber's "The Phantom of the Opera" before returning to New Orleans to refine his craft alongside the city's finest jazz musicians.

Upon his return to the Big Easy, Lemmler worked with several legendary New Orleans bandleaders including Bob French and the Original Tuxedo Jazz Band (over 100 years old), Herb Tassin and the Blue Room Orchestra, and master clarinetist Pete Fountain. He also performed with the Dukes of Dixieland, solidifying his place in the traditional New Orleans jazz scene. In 2001, Lemmler launched his own projects with his debut CD "Portraits of Wonder," a New Orleans jazz tribute to Stevie Wonder's music that received national attention and was performed to sold-out audiences at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival. The album featured renowned jazz artists including drummer Brian Blade, saxophonist John Ellis, Brice Winston, vocalist Leah Chase, George French, and trumpeter Nicholas Payton.

As musical director of the New Orleans Jazz Revival Band, Lemmler's mission is to share New Orleans' distinctly diverse culture with the world and ensure its legacy among future generations through collaborative mentorship and education. His musical style encompasses what he calls "New Orleans Stride"—a slower, loping rhythm akin to ragtime with an underlying triple-meter feel associated with James Booker and Erroll Garner. Currently serving as a Jazz Piano Professor at Loyola University and recognized as a Steinway Artist, Lemmler is notable as one of the few New Orleans pianists who performs as a solo pianist/vocalist interpreting the Great American Songbook. His work spans traditional jazz, gospel masses, classical arrangements, and contemporary pop interpretations, embodying the Ubuntu philosophy of interconnectedness in creativity that defines his approach to New Orleans' 300-year musical heritage.

## Fun Facts
- Lemmler made his professional debut at Carnegie Hall while pursuing his graduate studies at Manhattan School of Music, showcasing his original arrangements, compositions, and piano skills.

- His arrangement of 'If I Only Had a Brain' cleverly incorporates the chord changes from John Coltrane's 'Giant Steps,' creating a piece he titles 'If I Only Had a Trane.'
