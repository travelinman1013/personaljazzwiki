## Biography
Jimmy Ray Dean was born on August 10, 1928, in Olton, Lamb County, Texas, into a struggling rural family that soon moved to Seth Ward near Plainview. Raised by his mother Ruth Taylor Dean after his father George Otto Dean became absent, young Jimmy found solace in music amid hardship; his mother taught him piano at age 10, and he learned guitar, harmonica, and accordion while singing in the church choir. Dropping out of high school, he joined the Merchant Marines at 16 and later the U.S. Air Force, where he performed with the Tennessee Haymakers band at Bolling Air Force Base in Washington, D.C.[1][2][5]

## Fun Facts
- Jimmy Dean wrote his biggest hit 'Big Bad John' in just 90 minutes during a plane ride to Nashville, sparking a craze for heroic saga songs in country music[1][2].
- His CBS variety show 'The Jimmy Dean Show' (1957-1966) was the first to feature Jim Henson's Muppets, including early appearances by characters like Rowlf the Dog[4].
- Dean started his Jimmy Dean Meat Company in 1969 with his brother Don grinding hogs and his mother seasoning the sausage; he sold it to Sara Lee in 1984 for a reported $75 million+ profit by the late 1980s[1][2].
- 'Big Bad John' was country music's first gold record and held No. 1 on both country and pop charts for five weeks, earning Dean a Grammy[1][2][4].
