## Biography
Earl Zebedee Hooker was born on January 15, 1929, in Clarksdale, Mississippi, though he was raised in Chicago from an early age.[1][3] As a youthful prodigy, he preferred playing on the streets to attending school and frequently ran away from home for extended stays in the Mississippi Delta and South. By 1942, at just 13 years old, he was performing on Chicago street corners alongside childhood friends including Bo Diddley, having been influenced by the modern urban electric guitar styles of T-Bone Walker and Robert Nighthawk.[2] In 1949, he joined the King Biscuit Time radio show in Helena, Arkansas, before attempting to establish himself in Memphis's music scene. He quickly returned to the road, fronting his own band and establishing the pattern that would define his career: extensive touring interspersed with residencies in various cities, particularly Chicago.[2]

Hooker became the most respected and technically proficient guitarist in Chicago blues circles during the 1950s and 1960s, earning the distinction of being called the 'blues guitarists' guitarist.'[3] He recorded prolifically across numerous independent labels including King, Sun, Cuca, Jim-Ko, and Arhoolie, producing over 40 albums as a session musician and bandleader.[1] His instrumental "Blue Guitar" became his best-known work, later overdubbed with vocals by Muddy Waters to create the classic "You Shook Me."[2] B.B. King himself called Hooker "the best of the modern blues guitarists," acknowledging his "immaculate" controlled playing, intricate solo lines, and clean, tuneful slide technique.[1] Beyond his mastery of slide guitar, Hooker was a highly developed standard-guitar soloist and rhythm player who remained versatile enough to incorporate blues, boogie-woogie, R&B/soul, be-bop, pop, and country & western into his performances depending on his mood and audience reaction.[2]

In his final years, Hooker experienced a major tuberculosis attack in late summer 1967 and was hospitalized for nearly a year.[2] Upon his release in 1968, he assembled a new band featuring pianist Pinetop Perkins, harmonica player Carey Bell, bassist Geno Skaggs, vocalist Andrew Odom, and steel-guitar player Freddie Roulette, which was widely acclaimed as one of the best bands he had ever led.[2] He toured California in July 1969, performing at venues including The Matrix and Fillmore West, and performed at the first Chicago Blues Festival on August 30, 1969.[2] In October 1969, he toured Europe as part of the American Folk Blues Festival, playing twenty concerts in twenty-three days across nine countries to favorable reviews.[2] Hooker died on April 21, 1970, at age 40, from complications due to tuberculosis.[6]
