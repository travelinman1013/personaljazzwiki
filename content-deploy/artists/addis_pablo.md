## Biography
Addis Pablo, born on August 18, 1989, in Redbank, New Jersey, is a Jamaican reggae musician renowned for his mastery of the melodica, following directly in the footsteps of his father, the legendary Augustus Pablo (Horace Swaby). Raised in Jamaica at his father's home, Addis was immersed in music from an early age, receiving a melodica at three years old and growing up surrounded by reggae luminaries. He learned piano, some guitar, hand drums, and computer technology, developing a deep connection to the instrument that defined his father's innovative 'Far East' sound blending minor key motifs, dub textures, and spiritual resonance[1][2][8].

Addis began performing live in bands with veteran musicians like Chinna Smith and Style Scott, initially tributing his father's classics such as 'Java' before releasing his own material. His debut album *In My Father's House* introduced his style, mirroring Augustus Pablo's approach with melodica, vocals, and dub mixes, while he also produces under Suns of Dub with manager Ras Jammy. Performing genres like dub, roots reggae, and reggae, Addis has played alongside artists like Yami Bolo, Jah9, and Anthony B, maintaining a soft-spoken, understated presence on stage[1][2][3].

Today, Addis and sister Isis steward the family legacy through Rockers International, renovating the record store and label founded by Augustus in 1979, repressing vinyl, and developing a documentary. His work emphasizes healing through spiritual music, drawing from thousands of classic Rockers rhythms while collaborating on new projects[1][2][4].
