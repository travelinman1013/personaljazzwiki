## Biography
Joshua Redman is an American jazz saxophonist and composer, widely regarded as one of the leading voices of his generation. Born on February 1, 1969, in Berkeley, California, he is the son of acclaimed free-jazz saxophonist Dewey Redman and dancer Renee Shedroff.[1][3] Growing up in a culturally rich, musically diverse environment, he was exposed to jazz, classical, rock, soul, and various world traditions, and began playing clarinet at age nine before switching to tenor saxophone at ten.[1][3] He was largely self-taught on the horn, absorbing the work of John Coltrane, Ornette Coleman, Cannonball Adderley, his father Dewey, as well as artists from The Beatles and Aretha Franklin to Earth, Wind & Fire and Led Zeppelin.[3] Redman played in the award‑winning Berkeley High School Jazz Ensemble, then studied at Harvard College, graduating summa cum laude in 1991 with plans to attend Yale Law School before a one‑year deferral changed his life.[2][3]

After moving to New York City in 1991, Redman quickly became immersed in the jazz scene and, encouraged by friends, entered and won the Thelonious Monk International Jazz Saxophone Competition, a major turning point that led him to commit fully to music rather than law.[2][3][6] He signed with Warner Bros. Records in 1992 and released his self‑titled debut in 1993, earning a Grammy nomination and establishing himself as a formidable new bandleader.[3][4][6] Throughout the 1990s he recorded a string of influential albums—including "Wish," "MoodSwing," "Spirit of the Moment/Live at the Village Vanguard," "Freedom in the Groove," and "Timeless Tales (for Changing Times)"—and led cutting‑edge quartets featuring rising stars such as Brad Mehldau, Christian McBride, Brian Blade, Aaron Goldberg, Reuben Rogers, and Gregory Hutchinson.[1][4] Redman continued to expand his palette in the 2000s and beyond with projects like the Elastic Band (an electrified, groove‑based trio), the SFJAZZ Collective (which he helped found and direct), and numerous collaborations that balanced tradition and innovation while maintaining a strong melodic and narrative sense in his improvisations.[1][2][5]

Redman’s musical style is often described as a bridge between classic post‑bop and contemporary jazz, distinguished by a warm, full tenor sound, sophisticated harmonic language, and a keen rhythmic flexibility.[2][3] He draws deeply on the legacies of Coltrane and Ornette while embracing song forms, grooves, and lyricism that appeal beyond the jazz core audience, and he is known for both high‑energy, interactive group improvisation and reflective long‑form works such as "Passage of Time."[1][2] Beyond performing and recording (with nearly two dozen albums as a leader and multiple Grammy nominations), he has contributed to jazz as an organizer and educator, including helping to create the SFJAZZ Collective, serving as artistic director for SFJAZZ seasons, writing film music, and teaching as a Visiting Artist at Stanford University and as Artistic Director of the Roots, Jazz, and American Music program at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music.[1][2] These roles, along with his mentorship of younger musicians and sustained artistic evolution over three decades, have secured his legacy as one of contemporary jazz’s central figures.[2][5][6]

## Fun Facts
- Redman graduated from Harvard College summa cum laude in 1991 and had already been accepted to Yale Law School, planning to become a lawyer before winning the Thelonious Monk International Saxophone Competition convinced him to pursue music instead.[2][3][6]
- He considers himself largely self‑taught on saxophone, developing his sound and technique through listening and playing rather than formal conservatory study, despite growing up the son of a famous jazz musician.[1][3]
- Redman helped found and shape the SFJAZZ Collective, a high‑profile ensemble that each season focuses on both new original compositions and the repertoire of a selected jazz master, blending bandleading with curatorial work.[2][5]
- He wrote and performed the music for Louis Malle’s final film "Vanya on 42nd Street" and appears both on screen and on the soundtrack of Robert Altman’s jazz‑centered film "Kansas City," extending his work into cinema.[2]

## Musical Connections

### Mentors/Influences
- [[dewey_redman|Dewey Redman]] - Father and major musical role model; Joshua played and recorded with him early in his career and absorbed his adventurous approach to improvisation. (Album "Choices" (1992) and other performances together.) [Early 1990s and on[1][3]]
- [[ed_kelly|Ed Kelly]] - Bay Area pianist and educator whose classroom jam sessions Joshua attended after high school, providing formative experience in ensemble playing. (Informal jam sessions at Laney College in Oakland rather than commercial recordings.) [Late 1980s, post‑high‑school period[3]]
- [[john_coltrane|John Coltrane]] - Stylistic influence; Redman has cited Coltrane as a key inspiration in sound, harmony, and spiritual intensity. (Influence heard broadly across early albums such as "Joshua Redman" and "Wish.") [Ongoing influence cited throughout his career[3]]
- [[ornette_coleman|Ornette Coleman]] - Important conceptual and stylistic influence, especially regarding freedom and melody; also linked through Dewey Redman’s work with Ornette. (Reflected in Redman’s more open, exploratory projects and live improvisations.) [Ongoing influence across his discography[3]]

### Key Collaborators
- [[brad_mehldau|Brad Mehldau]] - Pianist in Redman’s first permanent quartet, contributing to a highly interactive small‑group sound that helped launch both of their careers. (Albums "MoodSwing," "Spirit of the Moment/Live at the Village Vanguard," and extensive touring.) [Mid‑1990s[1][4]]
- [[christian_mcbride|Christian McBride]] - Bassist and early peer who helped introduce Redman to the New York scene; frequent bandmate and close musical associate. (Redman’s 1990s quartets, trio tours, and collaborations including "MoodSwing" and live projects.) [Early 1990s onward[1][4][5]]
- [[brian_blade|Brian Blade]] - Drummer in Redman’s early quartet and later Elastic Band; known for deep rhythmic rapport and dynamic group interaction. (Albums "MoodSwing," "Spirit of the Moment/Live at the Village Vanguard," Elastic Band recordings.) [Mid‑1990s and 2000s[1][4][5]]
- [[pat_metheny|Pat Metheny]] - Guitarist who featured Redman in his band and on recordings, broadening Redman’s exposure and exploring modern jazz fusion contexts. (Redman’s album "Wish" and extensive touring with the Pat Metheny group.) [Early to mid‑1990s[1][4]]
- [[aaron_goldberg_reuben_rogers_gregory_hutchinson|Aaron Goldberg, Reuben Rogers, Gregory Hutchinson]] - Core members of Redman’s second acclaimed acoustic quartet, known for tight ensemble playing and modern post‑bop language. (Albums "Beyond" and "Passage of Time," plus touring.) [Late 1990s to early 2000s[1]]
- [[sam_yahel|Sam Yahel]] - Organ/keyboardist central to Redman’s Elastic Band project, helping shape its electrified, groove‑oriented sound. (Elastic Band recordings and tours beginning with 2002 releases.) [Early 2000s onward[1][5]]
- [[sfjazz_collective_members|SFJAZZ Collective members]] - Composer‑performer collective that Redman helped create and lead, collaborating on new works and arrangements. (SFJAZZ Collective concert seasons and recordings focusing on new compositions and repertory projects.) [Mid‑2000s (founding and early seasons)[2][5]]

### Artists Influenced
- [[younger_contemporary_jazz_saxophonists_e.g._peers_and_successors_in_post1990s_jazz|Younger contemporary jazz saxophonists (e.g., peers and successors in post‑1990s jazz)]] - Redman is widely cited in criticism and institutional profiles as one of the most important saxophonists of his generation, whose blend of tradition and modernity has become a model for younger players; specific individual protégés are not formally documented in major sources, but his recordings, leadership in SFJAZZ Collective, and teaching roles at Stanford and the San Francisco Conservatory of Music indicate a broad influence on emerging artists. (Influence radiates from albums like "MoodSwing," "Timeless Tales (for Changing Times)," "Beyond," and his work with SFJAZZ Collective, as well as his teaching and artistic‑director positions.) [Mid‑1990s to present[2][5][6]]
