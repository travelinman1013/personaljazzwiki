## Biography
MRCY is a British soul duo formed in 2021 by producer Barney Lister and vocalist Kojo Degraft-Johnson, both hailing from different ends of England and bringing together a rich tapestry of cultural and musical influences[1][4]. Barney grew up in Huddersfield, Yorkshire, immersed in the town’s vibrant soundsystem culture, which shaped his rhythmic sensibilities and production style[1][3]. Kojo, raised in South London, was steeped in gospel and choral music from his father’s Catholic church and his mother’s Ghanaian ministry, while also absorbing the legacy of soul icons like Aretha Franklin and Sam Cooke[1][3]. The pair first connected online during the pandemic, after Barney was struck by Kojo’s live Instagram performance; their chemistry was immediate, and their first session produced the track ‘R.L.M.’, which became the opening of their debut EP, VOLUME 1[1][2]. MRCY’s music is a blend of retro soul, R&B, funk, and psychedelia, characterized by Kojo’s commanding, gospel-inflected vocals and Barney’s lush, cinematic production—a sound that nods to classic soul while incorporating modern sensibilities reminiscent of artists like Khruangbin and Anderson .Paak[1][4]. Their lyrics often reflect on social and political turbulence, but the overarching message is one of unity, hope, and the power of shared experience[1][4]. Since their formation, MRCY have earned critical acclaim, touring Europe with Black Pumas, selling out London’s Jazz Café, and being named among DIY’s Class of 2025 and Rolling Stone’s Ones to Watch[3]. They are currently working on their debut album and continue to expand their reach with live performances and new releases[3][6].
