## Biography
Erykah Badu and The Alchemist are two of the most innovative and influential figures in contemporary music, each with a storied career that has shaped the sound of neo soul, R&B, and hip-hop. Erykah Badu, born Erica Abi Wright in Dallas, Texas, emerged in the mid-1990s as a leading voice in the neo soul movement, blending jazz, soul, and hip-hop with poetic lyricism and a distinctively warm vocal tone. Her debut album, 'Baduizm' (1997), was a critical and commercial success, earning her the nickname 'Queen of Neo Soul.' Over the years, Badu has continued to push boundaries with her music, fashion, and activism, releasing acclaimed albums such as 'Mama's Gun' (2000) and 'New Amerykah Part Two (Return of the Ankh)' (2010). The Alchemist, born Alan Maman in Beverly Hills, California, is a legendary hip-hop producer known for his atmospheric, sample-heavy beats and collaborations with some of the genre's most respected artists. Over three decades, he has worked with Nas, Mobb Deep, Earl Sweatshirt, Freddie Gibbs, and many others, earning Grammy nominations and a reputation as a sonic innovator. In 2025, Badu and The Alchemist joined forces for their first full-length collaborative album, 'Abi & Alan,' executive produced by Badu on her Control FREAQ Records label. The project marks Badu's first album in 15 years and showcases a meeting of minds between two seasoned artists, blending Badu's soulful artistry with The Alchemist's signature production style. Their collaboration is a testament to their enduring creativity and willingness to experiment, bringing together two distinct musical worlds in a way that feels both fresh and timeless.
