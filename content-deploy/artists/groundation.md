## Biography
Groundation is an American roots reggae band formed in 1998 at the Jazz Performance program of Sonoma State University in California by Harrison Stafford (guitar/lead vocals), Ryan Newman (bass), Marcus Urani (keyboards), and drummer James Stafford. Stafford's deep knowledge of reggae led him to teach the first California state university accredited class on the History and Culture of Reggae Music, where legends like Joseph Hill of Culture and Abba Melchezadek (Haile Selassie's private secretary) shared experiences.[1][2][3][5][6] The band's early albums, Young Tree (1999) and Each One Teach One (2001), established their signature roots reggae/jazz fusion sound, blending improvisation, funk, dub, and socially conscious lyrics while collaborating with foundational Jamaican artists like Marcia Higgs and Nyabinghi drumming master Ras Michael.[1][2][6]

Over the years, Groundation evolved through personnel changes but remained anchored by Harrison Stafford's leadership, incorporating jazz trumpeter David Chachere (2000), trombonist Kelsey Howard, drummer Rufus Te Kanawa Haereiti (2008), percussionist Mingo Lewis Jr. (son of Santana collaborator Mingo Lewis), and vocalists Kim Pommell and Stephanie Wallace (2007-2008).[1][2][3] They released acclaimed albums like Hebron Gate (2003), recorded at Lion and Fox studios with engineer Jim Fox, and continued with We Free Again (2004), Upon The Bridge (2006), Here I Am (2009), Building An Ark (2012), A Miracle (2014), and The Next Generation (2018), which opened with a full jazz big band and won Reggae.fr's Best Roots Reggae Album of 2018.[3][6] Known for dynamic live performances, the band has toured over 35 countries across 5 continents, headlining major festivals and earning recognition as the biggest, most respected American reggae band.[1][2][3][6]

Groundation's legacy lies in pushing reggae boundaries with jazz harmonies, live improvisation, and a commitment to social upheaval messages, fostering a unique international movement while honoring Jamaican roots through collaborations with elders like Don Carlos, Leroy 'Horsemouth' Wallace, Pablo Moses, and The Congos.[3][4]
