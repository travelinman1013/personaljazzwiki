## Biography
The Sensational Saints, a gospel group, were formed in the early 1950s in Cleveland, Ohio, under the leadership of Charles Chambliss, who had relocated from Tuskegee, Alabama. Members were handpicked from local spots including a clothing store, a pool room, and a group of friends singing from a third-story window, reflecting a grassroots beginning in the city's vibrant music scene.[1]

Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the group experienced rotating membership and released stray singles on various non-denominational labels, honing their sound at the intersection of funk and traditional gospel. By the late 1960s, they connected with Reverend Melvin Kenniebrew, a vocally gifted figure who elevated their performances, fulfilling their 'Sensational' name. Their career peaked in 1973 with the album 'You Won't Believe It' (also known as 'Try It You'll Like Us'), issued in limited quantities by James Bullard on the King James label, featuring a notable religious adaptation of a Bill Withers tune.[1]

The Sensational Saints' legacy endures through reissues by Numero Group, preserving their rare gospel-funk fusion as a unique artifact of 1970s independent gospel music, though they remain obscure with low mainstream popularity.
