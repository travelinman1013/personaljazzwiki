## Biography
Delmar Allen "Dale" Hawkins (August 22, 1936 – February 13, 2010) was a pioneering American rock singer, songwriter, and rhythm guitarist, often credited as the architect of swamp rock boogie[1][3]. Born on Goldmine Plantation in Richland Parish, Louisiana, Hawkins was immersed in music from a young age, influenced by his father's professional playing and the rich musical traditions of the region. He absorbed country and rhythm & blues from local radio and the blues and gospel sounds of black sharecroppers and church singers[3]. After joining the US Navy at fifteen and serving during the Korean War, Hawkins returned to Louisiana, where he worked at Stan’s Record Shop and began performing in local clubs[3].

Hawkins launched his recording career in 1956, and in 1957 released his most famous song, "Susie Q," featuring guitarist James Burton. The track blended rockabilly with heavy Louisiana blues, earning recognition as one of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's "500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll"[1][3]. Hawkins continued recording for Chess Records into the early 1960s, and later expanded his career as a producer, working with acts like The Uniques, The Five Americans, and Bruce Channel. He also hosted "The Dale Hawkins Show" on Philadelphia television and held executive roles at several record labels[1]. Hawkins experienced a career resurgence in the 1990s and 2000s, releasing acclaimed albums and earning induction into both the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame and the Rockabilly Hall of Fame[1][3].

Hawkins's musical style was marked by a fusion of rockabilly, blues, and swamp rock, characterized by driving rhythms and distinctive guitar work. His legacy endures through his influential recordings, production work, and mentorship of younger musicians. Hawkins's "Susie Q" inspired countless covers, most notably by Creedence Clearwater Revival, and his contributions helped shape the sound of early rock and roll[1][3].
