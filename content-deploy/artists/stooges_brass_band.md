## Biography
The Stooges Brass Band emerged from New Orleans in 1996 as a collective of high school students attending prestigious institutions including the New Orleans Center for Creative Arts (NOCCA), John F. Kennedy High School, and St. Augustine High School. Founded by bandleader Walter "Whoadie" Ramsey, a tuba and trombone player, the group initially cut their musical teeth performing at weddings, funerals, and local parties. Their breakthrough came in 1998 when they were invited to perform at the Rebirth Brass Band's 15th Anniversary Parade, establishing themselves as one of New Orleans' premier brass bands and launching their trajectory into national and international prominence.

The Stooges Brass Band distinguished themselves by blending traditional New Orleans brass band aesthetics with contemporary influences, creating a distinctive sound that members described as "The Roots meets Earth, Wind, and Fire, meets The Dirty Dozen." This fusion incorporated hip-hop elements with classic jazz traditions, allowing them to appeal to both traditionalists and younger audiences. The band's versatility and innovative approach earned them performances with major artists including Jessica Simpson ("Angels"), Jadakiss ("Time's Up"), and appearances at high-profile events such as President Barack Obama's campaign for Illinois Senator. Their international touring expanded their reach across Asia, Europe, and South America, with plans to introduce their music to African and Australian audiences.

By the early 2010s, the Stooges Brass Band had solidified their status as elite practitioners of contemporary New Orleans brass music. In 2010, they won the Red Bull Street Kings competition, defeating rival brass bands and earning an all-expense paid recording and mentorship session at Red Bull Studios in California. Their discography includes albums such as "It's About Time" and "The Reunion," featuring original compositions like "One of Dem Girls" (featuring JumpShive), "I Gotta Eat," and "Oh No." The band continues to represent the evolution of New Orleans brass traditions, consistently delivering performances that honor their heritage while pushing the genre forward.
