## Biography
The University Six was a short-lived but influential American jazz and dance band active in the late 1920s. The group was not a university ensemble, but rather a studio band comprised of some of New York’s finest jazz musicians of the era, assembled to record under the 'University Six' name for various record labels. The band is best known for its lively, syncopated performances that bridged the gap between ragtime, early jazz, and the emerging swing style.

The University Six featured a rotating roster of top musicians, many of whom were associated with the legendary Jean Goldkette and Paul Whiteman orchestras. Notable members included the celebrated cornetist Red Nichols, trombonist Miff Mole, clarinetist Jimmy Dorsey, and drummer Vic Berton. Their recordings, made between 1927 and 1930, showcased intricate arrangements, tight ensemble playing, and virtuosic solos, reflecting both the ragtime roots and the evolving jazz idiom of the period. The group’s output, though limited, is prized by collectors and historians for its high musicianship and as a snapshot of New York’s vibrant studio scene during the Jazz Age.

Though The University Six did not perform live as a touring band, their studio work contributed to the popularization of hot jazz and influenced the development of small-group swing. Their legacy endures in the continued appreciation of their recordings by jazz enthusiasts and in the careers of their illustrious members, many of whom went on to shape American jazz in the decades that followed.
