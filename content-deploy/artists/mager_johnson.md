## Biography
Mager Johnson was an early 20th‑century Mississippi blues guitarist and singer best known as one of the musical brothers of influential Delta bluesman Tommy Johnson.[2][3] Born around 1905 in the Crystal Springs–Terry area of Mississippi, he grew up in a large African American family in which several siblings became accomplished blues musicians, including Tommy and LeDell Johnson.[2][3] By the 1910s and 1920s, the Johnson brothers were active in the regional blues scene, playing at local gatherings and dances in and around Crystal Springs, with Mager developing a reputation—alongside LeDell—as an “incredibly fine” player in his own right.[2] His first name, often pronounced “Major,” has occasionally led to confusion in written sources, but period recollections by family and fellow musicians clearly distinguish him as a separate artist within the Johnson musical clan.[2]

Although Tommy Johnson became the best‑documented member of the family through his Paramount and Victor recordings of classics such as “Canned Heat Blues,” “Big Road Blues,” and “Cool Drink of Water Blues,” Mager contributed significantly to the family’s live performance tradition and to the local sound of Copiah County blues.[3] According to later research drawing on interviews with relatives and musicians who knew the family, Mager and LeDell were both regarded as highly skilled guitarists whose playing helped shape Tommy’s circle and the broader Mississippi blues community.[2] While no commercially issued recordings by Mager Johnson are known and surviving documentation of his career is sparse, his status as a respected regional player within one of Mississippi’s most important blues families secures his place—albeit a shadowy one—in early country blues history.[2][3][6]

## Fun Facts
- Contemporary researchers note that Mager Johnson’s first name was pronounced “Major,” which has led some listeners and writers unfamiliar with the family to misread or mishear his name.[2]
- Blues historian David Evans’ research—drawing heavily on interviews with the Johnson family—describes both LeDell and Mager as “incredibly fine players,” placing Mager on roughly the same technical level as his more documented brothers.[2]
- Mager figures in the famous crossroads legend not as a participant but as a family witness: later accounts mention that he was reportedly angered with brother LeDell for publicly talking about Tommy Johnson’s alleged deal with a mysterious figure at a crossroads.[5]
- Unlike his brother Tommy, who recorded for Victor and Paramount between 1928 and 1930, there are no known commercial recordings by Mager Johnson, making him one of several important Mississippi bluesmen remembered primarily through oral history and secondary research rather than surviving discs.[2][3][6]

## Musical Connections

### Mentors/Influences
- [[ledell_johnson|LeDell Johnson]] - Older brother and fellow blues guitarist within the Johnson family; part of the tight‑knit musical environment in which Mager developed, though LeDell is specifically cited as Tommy’s guitar teacher rather than Mager’s. (Live performances around Crystal Springs and Copiah County; no specific recordings documented for Mager.) [c. 1910s–1930s[2][3]]
- [[tommy_johnson|Tommy Johnson]] - Elder brother and major Mississippi blues figure whose repertoire and performing circuit overlapped with Mager’s; they frequently played together in the Crystal Springs area, influencing one another’s styles. (Regional performances; Tommy’s recorded titles such as “Canned Heat Blues,” “Big Road Blues,” and “Cool Drink of Water Blues” represent the family style, though Mager is not documented on these records.) [c. 1910s–1930s[2][3]]

### Key Collaborators
- [[tommy_johnson|Tommy Johnson]] - Regular live collaborator; Mager played guitar alongside Tommy in local bands and informal ensembles in and around Crystal Springs. (Local performances with the Johnson brothers; no confirmed studio collaborations on released records.) [c. 1920s–1930s[3]]
- [[ledell_johnson|LeDell Johnson]] - Guitar‑playing brother with whom Mager frequently performed, forming part of the Johnson family band tradition that supported Tommy’s shows and local dances. (Unrecorded joint performances in Crystal Springs and neighboring communities.) [c. 1920s–1930s[2][3]]

### Artists Influenced
- [[regional_mississippi_blues_musicians_around_crystal_springs_and_copiah_county|Regional Mississippi blues musicians around Crystal Springs and Copiah County]] - As an “incredibly fine” guitarist in the Johnson family circle, Mager contributed to the localized transmission of Tommy Johnson’s style and the broader country blues vocabulary, influencing younger and peer musicians who heard the brothers perform. (Informal, live performances rather than specific recordings; influence is documented through oral histories rather than named songs.) [c. 1920s–1940s[2][3]]
