## Biography
Roy Kent Head was born on January 9, 1941, in Three Rivers, Texas, to a sharecropping family. Growing up in a musically rich environment, he was exposed to a wide variety of genres through his small radio, including early Rhythm & Blues, country, and rockabilly. His childhood friends, who were mostly Black, introduced him to artists like Elmore James, Bobby Bland, and Little Junior Parker, while his mother's love for the Louisiana Hayride exposed him to country legends such as Hank Williams and Ernest Tubb. Head began performing in high school, forming his first band, The Traits, in San Marcos, Texas, around 1956. The band's early sound blended rockabilly, R&B, and rock and roll, reflecting the eclectic musical landscape of Texas.

Roy Head & The Traits achieved international fame in 1965 with their hit 'Treat Her Right,' a song that combined rockabilly and R&B and reached #2 on the pop charts. Head's dynamic stage presence, characterized by wild antics and energetic performances, set him apart as a unique figure in American music. After the band split in 1966, Head pursued a solo career, recording for labels such as Mercury, Elektra, and Texas Crude, and later found success in country music with hits like 'Baby’s Not Home' in the 1970s. He continued to perform regularly, maintaining a reputation for unpredictable and entertaining live shows well into his later years. Roy Head passed away on September 21, 2020, in Texas, leaving behind a legacy as a pioneering figure in the fusion of rockabilly and soul.
