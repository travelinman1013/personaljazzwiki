## Biography
Luke Winslow-King is a guitarist, singer, producer, and songwriter originally from Cadillac, Michigan, who has established himself as a master craftsman of American roots music. Born and raised in Northern Michigan, he began performing at an early age, starting the Winslow-King Blues Band when he was 13 and playing music festivals throughout his teenage years. Formally trained in musical composition at the University of New Orleans' classical music program, Winslow-King moved to New Orleans at age 19 and spent over 15 years immersing himself in the city's rich musical traditions, where he collaborated with local legends and developed his distinctive sound that seamlessly blends delta blues, roots rock, folk, gospel, R&B, and jazz influences.[1][2][3]

Winslow-King's professional recording career began in 2007, and he has since released eight full-length studio albums, with his most recent being "Flash-A-Magic" (2024), recorded across Tuscany, Italy and Memphis, Tennessee. His work is characterized by masterful guitar work, authentic vocals, and deeply personal songwriting that draws from both his classical training and his lived experiences navigating the American musical landscape. Beyond his solo work, he has shared stages with renowned artists including Jack White, Taj Mahal, and Rosanne Cash, and has performed at prestigious venues such as Austin City Limits, New Orleans JazzFest, Glastonbury, and Azkena Rock Festival.[1][2]

Winslow-King's artistry reflects a commitment to authenticity rooted in his Baptist church upbringing and his deep respect for traditional American music. His original composition "Everlasting Arms" was notably performed by Dr. John as part of the Playing for Change 'Songs Around the World' series, and his music has been featured on television programs including Anderson Cooper Live (CNN), NCIS: New Orleans (CBS), and Deadliest Catch (Discovery). His work demonstrates continuous artistic growth, evolving from more acoustic and jazz-influenced early albums to increasingly electric and rock-oriented productions while maintaining the emotional depth and sincerity that define his musical identity.[1][3]

## Fun Facts
- Winslow-King spent time in Kalkaska County jail in Northern Michigan after being arrested with a small amount of marijuana. During his solitary confinement (due to his severe peanut allergy requiring isolation), he wrote the song 'Break Down the Walls,' which reflects on overcoming personal boundaries and emerged from what he now views as a transformative life experience.[3]
- He is formally trained in musical composition and orchestration, with a college major in music composition, which gives him sophisticated knowledge of instrumental capabilities and the ability to write and arrange music for multiple instruments.[3]
- His eighth album 'Flash-A-Magic' was recorded across two continents—in the Tuscan fortress village of Lari, Italy and Memphis, Tennessee—demonstrating his international reach and commitment to capturing diverse sonic influences.[1]
- Winslow-King began his professional music journey early, starting the Winslow-King Blues Band at age 13 and playing music festivals throughout his high school years in Northern Michigan before eventually relocating to New Orleans at age 19.[7]
