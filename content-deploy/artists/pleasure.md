## Biography
Pleasure is an American band formed in Portland, Oregon in 1972, known for their innovative blend of soul, funk, and jazz with a distinctive street edge. The group emerged from the merger of two local bands, The Franchise and The Soul Masters, bringing together musicians such as drummer Bruce Carter, bassist Nathaniel Phillips, guitarist Marlon McClain, keyboardists Michael and Donald Hepburn, saxophonist Dennis Springer, trombonist/guitarist Dan Brewster, vocalist Sherman Davis, and percussionist Bruce Smith. Their dynamic sound quickly gained traction in the underground black music scene of the late 1970s, earning them a devoted following and cult status[3][5].

Pleasure's big break came after jazz saxophonist Grover Washington Jr., a fan of the band, introduced them to Wayne Henderson of The Crusaders. Henderson became their producer and mentor, helping secure a deal with Fantasy Records. Over a six-year relationship with the label, Pleasure released a series of albums that fused jazz, funk, soul, and rock. Their 1979 album 'Future Now' featured the hit single 'Glide,' which reached #55 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #10 on the R&B chart. The band's sophisticated musicianship and genre-crossing style made them influential not only among their contemporaries but also among later generations of hip-hop artists who sampled their work[3][5].

Despite not achieving massive mainstream fame, Pleasure's legacy endures through their innovative sound and the enduring popularity of tracks like 'Glide.' Their music continues to be celebrated for its complexity, groove, and influence on both funk and hip-hop, cementing their place as a seminal act in American music history[3][5].
