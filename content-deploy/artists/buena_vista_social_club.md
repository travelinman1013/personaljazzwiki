## Biography
Buena Vista Social Club is a Cuban musical project and ensemble formed in Havana in 1996, bringing together veteran musicians from Cuba’s pre-revolutionary golden age of son, bolero, danzón, and related genres. The group was convened by producer Nick Gold, guitarist Ry Cooder, and bandleader Juan de Marcos González, initially as an ad hoc studio collective rather than a standing band, with the name taken from a long-closed members’ club in the Buenavista district of Havana that had been a social and musical hub in the 1940s and 1950s. Their self-titled album, recorded in just a few days at EGREM Studios, showcased an intergenerational cast including Compay Segundo, Ibrahim Ferrer, Rubén González, Omara Portuondo, and Eliades Ochoa, many of whom had slipped into obscurity despite long careers in Cuban music.

The 1997 release of “Buena Vista Social Club” became an international phenomenon, winning a Grammy Award and introducing traditional Cuban styles to a global audience at a time when many of the musicians were already elderly. The project led to individual solo albums, international tours, and a small number of high-profile concerts, including acclaimed performances in Amsterdam and at New York’s Carnegie Hall that cemented their reputation as cultural ambassadors of Cuba’s mid‑20th‑century musical heritage. In 1999, Wim Wenders’ documentary film of the same name further amplified their profile, interweaving concert footage with personal stories of the musicians and helping spark a worldwide surge of interest in Cuban music and dance.

Buena Vista Social Club’s musical style centers on son cubano, bolero, and related traditional forms, characterized by acoustic guitar and tres, piano, percussion, call-and-response vocals, and danceable yet relaxed rhythmic grooves. Their work is often described as both nostalgic and timeless, preserving repertoire and performance practices that had largely disappeared from the international stage while remaining vital and emotionally immediate for contemporary listeners. Even as many original members have since died, surviving artists and associated ensembles, such as Orquesta Buena Vista Social Club and the Afro‑Cuban All Stars, have continued to tour and record, sustaining the project’s legacy as a symbol of Cuban cultural continuity and of late‑life artistic rediscovery.

## Fun Facts
- The original Buena Vista Social Club sessions in Havana were recorded in roughly six days, yet produced not only the famous album but also material for several related releases.
- The ensemble took its name from a real members’ club in Havana’s Buenavista neighborhood, a once-thriving venue for Afro‑Cuban social events and live music that had closed decades earlier.
- Before being recruited for the project, singer Ibrahim Ferrer had largely retired from professional music and was making a living doing odd jobs, including shining shoes and selling lottery tickets.
- Despite their advanced ages, several core members went from relative obscurity to performing on major international stages such as Amsterdam’s Carré Theatre and New York’s Carnegie Hall in the space of just a few years.
