## Biography
Carrie Marie Underwood was born on March 10, 1983, in Muskogee, Oklahoma, and raised on her parents' farm in the nearby rural town of Checotah. The youngest of three sisters, with Shanna and Stephanie as her elders, she grew up in a supportive family; her father Steve worked in a paper mill, and her mother Carole was an elementary school teacher who encouraged her artistic pursuits by sewing outfits for talent shows. From age three, Underwood sang in her local First Free Will Baptist Church and performed at events like the Robbins Memorial Talent Show, Old Settler's Day, and Lions Club gatherings. An active student, she excelled in Checotah High School as salutatorian in 2001, participating in cheerleading, basketball, softball, and the Honor Society, before attending Northeastern State University, where she studied mass communications, joined the Sigma Sigma Sigma sorority, and performed in the Downtown Country show.[1][2][5]

At 14, a local admirer arranged an audition for Underwood in Nashville with Capitol Records, leading to near-signing in 1997, but management changes canceled it—a setback she later viewed positively as she wasn't ready. Opting for practicality post-high school, she worked various jobs including as a page for an Oklahoma state representative, waiting tables, at a zoo, and a veterinary clinic, while competing in beauty pageants and earning Miss NSU runner-up in 2004. Her breakthrough came during her senior year when, with parental encouragement, she auditioned for American Idol Season 4 in St. Louis, advancing to win in 2005. Her debut single 'Inside Your Heaven' topped the Billboard Hot 100, making her the only country artist and solo country artist of the 2000s to achieve this. She graduated magna cum laude from Northeastern State in 2006 amid rising fame.[1][2][3][5]

Underwood's musical style is rooted in country, blending powerful vocals with themes of faith, heartbreak, and empowerment, as showcased in albums like Some Hearts (2005) and Carnival Ride (2007). Inducted into the Grand Ole Opry by Garth Brooks in 2008 at age 26—the youngest until Kelsea Ballerini in 2019—she won back-to-back ACM Entertainer of the Year awards. A multi-format superstar, she has expanded into songwriting, production, acting, authorship, and entrepreneurship, solidifying her legacy as one of country's most successful artists with Spotify genres in country and a popularity score of 73.[2][5][7]
