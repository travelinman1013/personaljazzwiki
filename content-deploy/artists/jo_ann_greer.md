## Biography
Jo Ann Greer, born Katherine Joan Greer on April 3, 1927, in Los Angeles, California, was a distinguished American singer whose career spanned nearly five decades. Raised in a musically inclined family—her mother was a piano teacher—Greer was immersed in the arts from a young age and developed her craft by absorbing the sounds of big bands and jazz legends during her formative years. Her early exposure to Hollywood’s vibrant culture and her admiration for icons like Billie Holiday and Bing Crosby deeply influenced her vocal style, which blended pop, jazz, and big band elements.

Greer’s professional journey began in the late 1940s, initially gaining recognition through her marriage to pianist Freddie Slack and her performances with local orchestras. Her big break came with Ray Anthony’s band, where she recorded hits such as “Wild Horses” and “The Hokey Pokey.” In 1953, she joined Les Brown’s Band of Renown, replacing Lucy Ann Polk as the lead vocalist—a role she held for nearly 40 years, touring internationally and recording numerous singles. Greer’s signature renditions, like "Sentimental Journey," and her engaging stage presence earned her the 1956 Down Beat Readers Poll for "best girl band vocalist."

Beyond her work with big bands, Greer became renowned as a "ghost singer" in Hollywood, providing the singing voices for stars such as Rita Hayworth in films like "Affair in Trinidad," "Miss Sadie Thompson," and "Pal Joey." Her behind-the-scenes contributions to film soundtracks and her dedication to her craft left a lasting legacy, both as a performer and as a vital yet often uncredited voice in American entertainment. Greer continued to perform into the early 1990s and passed away in Los Angeles on May 24, 2001.
