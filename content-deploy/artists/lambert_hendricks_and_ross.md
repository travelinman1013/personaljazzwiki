## Biography
Lambert, Hendricks & Ross was a groundbreaking American vocal jazz trio formed in 1957 by Dave Lambert, Jon Hendricks, and Annie Ross. The group emerged at a time when vocalese—the art of setting lyrics to jazz instrumental solos—was still a niche style, and each member brought pioneering experience to the genre. Their debut album, 'Sing a Song of Basie' (1958), reimagined Count Basie’s big band arrangements using only three voices, multi-tracked to create the effect of a full choir. The album's success led to a direct collaboration with the Count Basie Orchestra on 'Sing Along with Basie' (1959), cementing their reputation as innovators in vocal jazz.[1][4][5][6]

The trio’s signature sound combined Lambert’s intricate vocal arrangements, Hendricks’s witty and literate lyrics, and Ross’s agile, expressive voice. Their approach fused bebop harmonies and improvisational techniques with ensemble singing, transforming jazz standards and instrumental classics into vocal masterpieces. From 1959 to 1962, they recorded several acclaimed albums for Columbia Records and became known for their energetic live performances. Annie Ross left the group in 1962 and was replaced by Yolande Bavan; the group continued as Lambert, Hendricks & Bavan until disbanding in 1964. Their work has been recognized with Grammy Awards and Hall of Fame honors, and their influence endures in the vocal jazz world.[1][4][5][6]

Lambert, Hendricks & Ross were notable not only for their musical achievements but also for their social impact as one of the few racially integrated and mixed-gender jazz groups in 1950s America. Their innovative vocalese style and sophisticated arrangements paved the way for future vocal groups and helped redefine the role of the voice in jazz, inspiring generations of musicians and vocalists.[6][4]

## Fun Facts
- The group originally planned to use a full vocal choir for their debut album, but ended up multi-tracking their own voices due to dissatisfaction with the studio choir, creating a unique sound.[4][5]
- Lambert, Hendricks & Ross were one of the first racially integrated and mixed-gender jazz vocal groups in the United States, which was highly unusual in the 1950s.[6]
- Their song 'Twisted,' featuring Annie Ross's lyrics set to a Wardell Gray melody, became a jazz standard and was later covered by Joni Mitchell.[1]
- The trio was voted Best Vocal Group in the DownBeat Readers Poll for five consecutive years (1959-1963).[1][2]
