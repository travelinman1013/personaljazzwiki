## Biography
The Charlie Byrd Trio was founded by American jazz guitarist Charlie Byrd, who was born in Suffolk, Virginia, in 1925 and raised in the nearby community of Chuckatuck. Byrd began playing guitar at age 10, taught by his father, and was inspired by local musicians who gathered at his family's general store. After serving in World War II, where he performed for troops in Europe, Byrd returned to the United States and studied jazz theory and composition in New York. In the early 1950s, he developed a keen interest in classical guitar, studying with Sophocles Papas and later with the legendary Andrés Segovia in Italy.

Byrd formed his first jazz trio in the mid-1950s, finding the trio format ideal for blending jazz, blues, and classical influences. His signature approach featured fingerstyle playing on a classical guitar, which was unusual in jazz at the time. The trio's music was characterized by a sophisticated fusion of jazz improvisation, classical technique, and, later, the rhythms and harmonies of Brazilian bossa nova. The Charlie Byrd Trio gained wider recognition in the late 1950s and early 1960s, particularly after Byrd's collaboration with Stan Getz on the landmark album 'Jazz Samba' (1962), which helped introduce bossa nova to American audiences. Throughout his career, Byrd recorded prolifically and performed with a variety of notable musicians, leaving a legacy as a pioneering figure in Latin jazz and bossa nova in the United States.
