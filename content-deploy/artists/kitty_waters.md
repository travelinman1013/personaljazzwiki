## Biography
Kitty Waters was a female blues singer active in the classic blues and ragtime era, recording during the 1920s and early 1930s. She is known primarily through her track 'Mean Old Bed Bug Blues,' featured on the compilation *Female Blues Singers Vol. 14 S/T/U/W/Y (1923-1932)*, indicating her place among early 20th-century women in the genre.[4] Little is documented about her early life, personal background, or career trajectory beyond these recordings, suggesting she was one of many lesser-known artists in the vaudeville and early recording blues scene.

Her musical style aligned with the classic blues of the period, characterized by vocal performances accompanied by piano or small ensembles, often addressing themes of hardship and humor as in 'Mean Old Bed Bug Blues.'[4] With a Spotify popularity of 0, she remains obscure today, lacking mainstream recognition or extensive discography details in available sources.[context] No information on later career developments or legacy is available from credible sources.
