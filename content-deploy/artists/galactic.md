## Biography
Galactic is a renowned American band formed in 1994 in New Orleans, Louisiana, by childhood friends Robert Mercurio (bass) and Jeff Raines (guitar), who moved from the Washington, DC area to attend college at Tulane and Loyola Universities. Immersed in the vibrant local funk scene, they joined forces with drummer Stanton Moore, keyboardist Rich Vogel, and saxophonist Ben Ellman, eventually stabilizing as a sextet with vocalist Theryl "Houseman" DeClouet. Initially performing under the name Galactic Prophylactic, the group quickly became known for their marathon live shows, improvisational jams, and a sound deeply rooted in the traditions of New Orleans funk, drawing inspiration from legendary acts like The Meters and Professor Longhair[1][2][3].

Over the years, Galactic evolved musically, incorporating elements of jazz, hip-hop, rock, electronica, and soul into their repertoire. Their early albums leaned heavily on jazzy funk, but subsequent releases showcased a broader palette, including collaborations with rappers and guest vocalists after DeClouet's departure in 2004. Notably, their 2007 album "From the Corner to the Block" featured prominent hip-hop artists, marking a new chapter in their creative journey. Galactic has remained a cornerstone of the New Orleans music scene, celebrated for their high-energy performances at iconic venues such as Tipitina's, the House of Blues, and the Howlin' Wolf, and for their role in perpetuating and innovating the city's musical legacy[1][2][3][4].

The band's influence extends beyond their own recordings and shows, as they have collaborated with a wide array of artists and contributed to the evolution of New Orleans music. Their purchase of the legendary Tipitina's nightclub in 2018 further cemented their commitment to the city's cultural heritage. Galactic continues to tour and record, working with vocalists like Anjelika "Jelly" Joseph and featuring guest appearances from artists such as Macy Gray, Cyril Neville, Trombone Shorty, Irma Thomas, John Boutté, and Big Freedia[3].
