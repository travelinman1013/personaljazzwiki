## Biography
Sinéad O'Connor (8 December 1966 – 26 July 2023) was an Irish singer, songwriter, record producer, and activist who rose to international prominence in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Born in Glenageary, County Dublin, Ireland, O'Connor had a troubled childhood that led her to seek solace in music at a young age. After leaving school at 15, she eventually found her way into Dublin's music scene, joining the pub-rock band Ton Ton Macoute in the mid-1980s, where her powerful and expressive voice quickly became the band's standout feature. Her performances caught the attention of Ensign Records, leading to her signing with the London-based label in 1985.

O'Connor's debut album, *The Lion and the Cobra* (1987), established her as a critical force in music, earning her a Grammy nomination for Best Rock Vocal Performance, Female, and selling over 500,000 copies worldwide. However, it was her second album, *I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got* (1990), that catapulted her to global superstardom. The album's lead single, "Nothing Compares 2 U"—a Prince composition that O'Connor reimagined—became a phenomenal international hit, reaching number one in America for four weeks and earning her four Grammy Award nominations including Best Album and Best Female Vocalist. The album itself sold over seven million copies worldwide, making it her biggest commercial success.

Beyond her musical achievements, O'Connor became known for her activism and controversial public stances. She famously tore up a photograph of Pope John Paul II on live television during a 1992 Saturday Night Live performance, sparking significant controversy. In 1999, she was ordained as the first-ever priestess of the Latin Tridentine Church, a dissident Catholic group, taking the clerical name Mother Bernadette Marie. Throughout her career, O'Connor continued to release albums across diverse genres, including reggae-influenced work (*Throw Down Your Arms*, 2005) and traditional Irish music (*Sean-Nós Nua*, 2002). Her later albums, such as *How About I Be Me (And You Be You)?* (2012) and *I'm Not Bossy, I'm the Boss* (2014), received critical acclaim. O'Connor's memoir, *Rememberings*, published in 2021, became a bestseller. She passed away on 26 July 2023, at the age of 56, leaving behind a legacy as one of the most distinctive and influential voices in modern music.
