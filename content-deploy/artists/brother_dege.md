## Biography
David John Legg, professionally known as Brother Dege (June 8, 1967 – March 8, 2024), was an American singer, songwriter, and musician who emerged from Lafayette, Louisiana as one of the Deep South's most distinctive voices in roots and blues music. Born to Air Force parents, Legg moved frequently during childhood, spending time in Northern California and Georgia before eventually settling in the South. He earned a Bachelor of Arts in philosophy from Louisiana State University and was deeply influenced by literary figures including Henry Miller, Charles Bukowski, and Gabriel García Márquez, as well as Beat Generation writers. His musical foundation was built on 1970s and 1980s rock—Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Jimi Hendrix, and AC/DC—combined with pre-war blues masters like Blind Willie Johnson, Son House, Robert Johnson, and Bukka White, alongside the lyrical sensibilities of Tom Waits and Bob Dylan. Teaching himself guitar, Legg developed a distinctive sound he termed "psyouthern" (psychedelic and southern), characterized by dark, spooky energy that reflected his regional roots.

Legg's professional career began in 1994 when he formed Santeria, a Lafayette-based band that fused psychedelic influences with hard-hitting Southern rock over a decade-long run, self-releasing four albums on his own label before dissolving in 2008. During the 2000s, he pursued diverse musical projects including stints with C.C. Adcock's touring band and leading Black Bayou Construkt, while simultaneously developing his solo work as Brother Dege. His unconventional recording approach—capturing ambient textures in trailers, elevator shafts, open fields, and abandoned houses—resulted in the ambitious album "Folk Songs of the American Longhair," which took ten years to complete. His breakthrough came in 2011 when director Quentin Tarantino selected his signature song "Too Old to Die Young" for the film *Django Unchained*, leading to Grammy nomination recognition and enabling him to pursue music full-time. Over his final years, Brother Dege toured extensively across America and Europe, gaining particular notoriety in Belgium and the Netherlands, while maintaining his DIY ethos and working various jobs including cab driver, dishwasher, mechanic, line cook, caseworker, and journalist. He passed away on March 8, 2024, at age 56 in Lafayette, with his final album *Aurora* released posthumously on March 15, 2024.

Brother Dege's legacy encompasses not only his distinctive "cinematic" musical approach but also his work as an accomplished writer and author, including the 2020 memoir *Cablog: Diary of a Cabdriver*. His music, described by critics as tunneling "into the ancient mysteries of pre-war blues and its devil-obsessed masters," represented a unique fusion of roots traditions with experimental production techniques. Though he remained relatively obscure for much of his career, his influence grew substantially in his final years, particularly in European music circles where his passing garnered significant media attention.

## Fun Facts
- Brother Dege recorded an entire exploratory ambient album in the trailer he called home during the 2000s, and filmed guerrilla-style performance videos in unconventional locations including abandoned houses and the woods outside Mamou, Louisiana.
- During his early solo touring years as Brother Dege, he traveled across America with only a dobro, a slide, some pedals, and an amp, often sleeping in a black van with 'Black Bayou Ministries' painted on the side.
- His song 'Hard Row to Hoe' was licensed by the producers of the American reality television series *Deadliest Catch*, bringing his music to mainstream television audiences.
- Beyond music, Brother Dege was a prolific writer and journalist who published four books, including the 2020 memoir *Cablog: Diary of a Cabdriver*, which recounted wild experiences from his time working as a cab driver to support himself while pursuing music.
