## Biography
Carl Martin (April 1 or 15, 1906 – May 10, 1979) was a highly versatile American musician born in Big Stone Gap, Virginia, at the heart of Appalachia. Raised in a musical family—his father was a fiddler known as Fiddlin’ Martin, and he learned guitar from his older brother—Martin developed proficiency on a range of stringed instruments, most notably the mandolin and guitar. His early career saw him performing with groups such as the Four Keys, the Tennessee Chocolate Drops, and the Wandering Troubadours, often playing at medicine shows, county fairs, and on the radio[1][2][3][4].

Martin’s musical journey took a significant turn when he formed a long-lasting trio with Ted Bogan (guitar) and Howard Armstrong (violin). Together, under various names, they helped preserve and popularize the African-American string band tradition within the Piedmont blues and Appalachian music scenes. During the 1930s, Martin moved to Chicago, where he accompanied notable blues musicians like Bumble Bee Slim and Tampa Red, and recorded solo works such as "Crow Jane" and "Old Time Blues," which showcased his intricate guitar work. He was also known for his ability to adapt to diverse audiences, performing blues, jazz, pop, country, and even non-English songs throughout Chicago’s neighborhoods[1][2][3].

After years of solo work, Martin reunited with Bogan and Armstrong in the 1970s, performing at folk and blues festivals across the United States. His legacy is marked by his technical mastery, genre-spanning repertoire, and his role in sustaining African-American old-time music. He passed away in Pontiac, Michigan, in 1979. Steve Goodman paid tribute to Martin in the song "You Better Get It While You Can (The Ballad of Carl Martin)," underscoring Martin’s enduring influence on the American roots music landscape[1][3].
