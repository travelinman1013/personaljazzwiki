## Biography
Old Crow Medicine Show is an Americana string band that was founded in 1998 when a group of young, old-time string musicians left Ithaca, New York, with the ambitious goal of playing their way across North America. The band began their journey by busking on street corners throughout Canada and the northeastern United States, traveling with pawnshop fiddles, banjos, guitars, and washboards to downtown areas, farmers markets, and small towns across Ontario, Manitoba, and the Pacific Northwest. After recrossing the country, they settled in the mountains of North Carolina near Boone, where they immersed themselves in Appalachian culture and expanded their repertoire of traditional old-time songs by playing with local musicians.

The band's breakthrough came in 2000 when bluegrass legend Doc Watson discovered them busking outside a pharmacy in Boone, North Carolina, the day after Independence Day. Watson was so impressed by what he described as "some of the most authentic old time music he'd heard in a long time" that he invited them to perform at MerleFest, which led to their relocation to Nashville in October 2000. In Nashville, they were mentored by Marty Stuart, the president of the Grand Ole Opry, who added them to his touring package and helped them gain exposure opening for major country artists. The band made their Grand Ole Opry debut at the Ryman Auditorium in January 2001, where they received a rare standing ovation and encore request for their original song "Tear It Down." They were formally inducted as official members of the Grand Ole Opry on September 17, 2013.

Over more than two decades, Old Crow Medicine Show has established itself as one of America's most beloved old-time string bands, blending pre-World War II blues and folk songs with original compositions that capture both traditional and contemporary sounds. Their 2004 self-titled album *O.C.M.S.*, produced by Dave Rawlings, sold over 100,000 copies and featured the hit "Wagon Wheel." Their ninth album, *Remedy*, released in 2014, won the Grammy Award for Best Folk Album. Known for their "raucous, warm-hearted performances" and described as an "American roots string band with punk rock attitude and energy," the group has influenced the broader string band revival movement and inspired acts like Mumford & Sons. The band has earned two Grammy Awards, built a devoted fanbase through relentless touring, and become recognized torchbearers of Nashville's musical heritage.

## Fun Facts
- The band's discovery by Doc Watson was serendipitous—they were busking outside a pharmacy in Boone, North Carolina, the day after July 4th, specifically trying to attract tourists from Charlotte when Watson happened upon them.
- Guitarist Kevin Hayes was originally raking blueberries in Bar Harbor, Maine, when he encountered frontman Ketch Secor playing banjo on the street in front of a jewelry store, leading to his joining the band.
- During their Grand Ole Opry debut at the Ryman Auditorium in January 2001, they were given only four minutes on stage but received a rare first-time-out standing ovation and an encore request for their original song "Tear It Down."
- Frontman Ketch Secor describes the band's philosophy as being "in the joy business," noting that from the very start, virtues of Christmas—the revelry, singalongs, and happiness—have been present in their performances.
