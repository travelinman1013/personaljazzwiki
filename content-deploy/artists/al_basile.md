## Biography
Al Basile is an American blues and roots singer-songwriter, cornetist, poet, and playwright, known for his literate songwriting and elegant, jazz-inflected approach to modern blues. Born and raised in Haverhill, Massachusetts, he grew up in a park in that mill town north of Boston, the son of first‑generation Italian American parents.[7][10] He attended Phillips Academy Andover, graduating in 1966, and went on to Brown University, where in 1970 he became the first person to receive a master’s degree from Brown’s Writing Program, marking him early on as a serious craftsman of language as well as music.[1][7][8][9] Alongside his academic and literary work, he developed a deep love of blues, jazz, and gospel music that would become the foundation of his musical voice.[6]

Basile’s professional performing career began in 1973 when guitarist Duke Robillard hired him as the first trumpet player for the Rhode Island jump-blues band Roomful of Blues, placing him squarely in the center of the New England blues renaissance.[2][4] After leaving the band, he remained a close associate of Robillard and, beginning in 1990, became a songwriter and recording member of the Duke Robillard Band, appearing on a dozen CDs and a DVD while having his songs recorded by artists such as Ruth Brown and used in film and television.[1][3][8] Starting in 1998 he launched a prolific solo career under his own name, releasing a long series of blues and roots albums—eighteen by the mid‑2020s, most of which reached the Top 15 on the Living Blues airplay charts—almost all produced by Robillard and featuring many former Roomful of Blues members as well as guests like the Blind Boys of Alabama.[1][8] His work has earned multiple Blues Music Award nominations and established him as a distinctive voice in contemporary blues, blending narrative songwriting, horn-led arrangements, and a literate, often mid‑century‑flavored perspective on American life.[1][6][7]

Parallel to his musical output, Basile has built a substantial literary career, publishing several books of poetry and writing verse audio plays, including “Flash Blind,” which won a Silver Award at the HEARnow national audio drama festival in 2019.[1] He is a member of the Powow River Poets and has taught and lectured on song lyric writing at venues such as the West Chester Poetry Conference and Boston University, extending his influence to a younger generation of writers and songwriters.[1][3] Hosting the online program “Poems On,” he curates conversations among poets about their work and inspirations, underscoring the continuity between his blues storytelling, his theatrical projects, and his commitment to language. Taken together, his contributions as a musician, writer, and educator have given him a lasting, if understated, legacy as a multi‑disciplinary artist who bridges classic blues traditions with contemporary literary craft.[1][7][8]
