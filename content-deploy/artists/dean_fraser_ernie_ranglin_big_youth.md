## Biography
Dean Fraser, Ernie Ranglin, and Big Youth are three of Jamaica’s most influential musicians, each with a distinct legacy in reggae and related genres. Dean Fraser, born in Kingston in 1957, began his musical journey on the clarinet at age 12 before switching to saxophone at 15. He quickly became a sought-after session musician, forming a renowned horn section with Ronald 'Nambo' Robinson and Junior 'Chico' Chinn, and later joining Lloyd Parks' We The People Band. Fraser’s career has spanned hundreds of recordings since the mid-1970s, and he is celebrated for his soulful saxophone work on reggae classics and as a producer and arranger for many of Jamaica’s top artists.[4][6]

Ernie Ranglin, born in 1932, is a pioneering guitarist whose career began in the 1940s. He developed a unique style blending jazz and Jamaican rhythms, playing in bands like the Eric Deans Orchestra and drawing inspiration from jazz greats such as Django Reinhardt. Ranglin’s innovative guitar work helped shape the sound of ska and reggae; he famously arranged and played on Millie Small’s 'My Boy Lollipop' and The Wailers' 'It Hurts to be Alone.' Over his long career, Ranglin has released more than 30 solo albums and collaborated with legends across genres, earning Jamaica’s Order of Jamaica for his contributions.[1][2][5][6]

Big Youth (born Manley Buchanan in 1949) is a legendary deejay and vocalist whose energetic toasting style helped define the sound of 1970s reggae and dub. Known for his socially conscious lyrics and charismatic delivery, Big Youth’s collaborations with top producers and musicians have made him a fixture in reggae history. In 2022, these three artists united for the album 'Two Colors,' with Big Youth featured on the lead single 'De Ranglin,' exemplifying the enduring creativity and collaborative spirit of Jamaican music.[1][2][3][5]
