## Biography
Jimmy Scott, born James Victor Scott on July 17, 1925, in Cleveland, Ohio, was the third of ten children in a musical family. His earliest musical experiences came from singing with his mother at the family piano and in the church choir. Tragedy struck at age thirteen when his mother was killed by a drunk driver, leaving him orphaned. Scott was diagnosed with Kallmann syndrome, a rare genetic disorder that prevented him from experiencing puberty, resulting in his distinctive high contralto voice and slight stature[2][3][4].

Scott's professional breakthrough came in 1949 when Lionel Hampton hired him as a featured vocalist, giving him the nickname "Little Jimmy Scott." He quickly gained recognition for his emotionally charged ballads, notably with the hit "Everybody's Somebody's Fool" in 1950. Despite his talent, Scott often faced professional setbacks, including lack of credit on major recordings and contractual disputes that led to the withdrawal of his critically acclaimed 1963 album "Falling in Love is Wonderful," produced by Ray Charles. These challenges caused his career to fade in the late 1960s, and he returned to Cleveland, working various jobs outside music until a revival in the 1990s brought renewed attention to his artistry[2][4].

Scott's musical style was marked by his androgynous voice, slow phrasing, and deep emotional resonance, earning admiration from legends like Billie Holiday, Ray Charles, and Nancy Wilson. His influence extended across genres, inspiring artists with his vulnerability and honesty. Over a career spanning more than six decades, Scott performed with jazz greats such as Charlie Parker, Sarah Vaughan, and Lester Young, as well as contemporary musicians like Lou Reed and David Byrne. He remains celebrated as one of the most unique and influential vocalists in jazz history[3][4][6].
