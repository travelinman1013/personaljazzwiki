## Biography
The Citizens of Halloween is a contemporary musical group known for their atmospheric, seasonally inspired soundscapes that evoke the playful eeriness of Halloween. Emerging in the early 2020s, the group’s origins are rooted in a collaborative, improvisational approach: they typically construct backing tracks first and then develop semi-improvised lead vocal lines as the lyrics evolve. This process results in music that feels both spontaneous and thematically cohesive, capturing the whimsical yet haunting spirit of their namesake holiday.

Their most notable release, 'This Is Halloween [seasonal],' achieved chart success in 2023, peaking at #38 and gaining traction as a staple in Halloween playlists. The group’s musical style blends elements of synth-pop, indie electronic, and theatrical rock, often incorporating sound effects and motifs reminiscent of classic Halloween media. While little is publicly known about the individual members, their work is characterized by a communal ethos and a focus on mood and atmosphere over traditional pop structures. The Citizens of Halloween have quickly developed a cult following among fans of holiday-themed music, with their tracks frequently featured in seasonal events and playlists.
