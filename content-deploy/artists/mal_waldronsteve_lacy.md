## Biography
Mal Waldron and Steve Lacy represent one of jazz's most significant and enduring partnerships, spanning approximately thirty years from their first meeting in 1958 until Waldron's death in 2002. Malcolm Earl "Mal" Waldron (August 16, 1925 – December 2, 2002) was an American jazz pianist, composer, and arranger who began his professional career in New York in 1950 after graduating from college. He quickly established himself as a versatile and intellectually rigorous musician, working with major figures including Charles Mingus, Jackie McLean, John Coltrane, and Eric Dolphy, while also serving as Billie Holiday's pianist from April 1957 until her death in July 1959. Steven Norman Lackritz, known as Steve Lacy (July 23, 1934 – June 4, 2004), was an American jazz saxophonist and composer who came to prominence in the 1950s as a progressive dixieland musician before becoming recognized as one of the most important players of soprano saxophone. Their collaboration began earnestly when they met as expatriates in Europe and recorded together from 1971 to 2002, creating an ideal balance of unique voices with contrasting yet complementary styles. Both musicians shared a deep musical connection rooted in their mutual devotion to Thelonious Monk's compositions and philosophy, and their partnership embodied essential virtues of collaboration: deep listening, sensitivity, and mutual respect. After Waldron's health crisis and relocation to Europe, he developed into an even more fiery and individualistic version of himself, removing unnecessary ornaments from his playing and developing a rhythmically-centered approach. Their final official recording together, "One Last Time," was recorded in 2002 and released before Waldron's death in December that year, with Lacy passing away from cancer just two years later in 2004.
