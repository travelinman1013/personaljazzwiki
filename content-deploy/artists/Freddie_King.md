## Biography
Freddie King, born Freddie Christian on September 3, 1934, in Gilmer, Texas, emerged as one of the most influential blues guitarists of the 20th century. Taught guitar by his mother and uncle from the age of six, King was steeped in the rural Texas blues tradition before moving with his family to Chicago in 1949. There, he absorbed the electric Chicago blues sound, sneaking into clubs as a teenager to watch and sometimes play with legends like Howlin' Wolf. By the early 1950s, King was performing in local bands and recording for small labels, steadily building his reputation in the vibrant Chicago scene.[1][3][6]

King's breakthrough came after signing with Federal Records in 1960, where he collaborated with pianist Sonny Thompson and released a string of influential singles, including "You've Got to Love Her with a Feeling" and the instrumental "Hide Away." The latter became a major crossover hit, cementing his status as a bridge between blues and popular music. King's style fused the raw energy of Texas blues with the urban sophistication of Chicago, characterized by his powerful vocals and searing guitar solos. In the late 1960s and 1970s, he expanded his audience by touring with rock acts and recording for Cotillion and Shelter Records, influencing a new generation of guitarists. King's relentless touring and dynamic performances made him a fixture at clubs and festivals across the United States and Europe.[1][3][4]

Despite a career cut short by his death in 1976 at age 42, King's legacy endures. He was posthumously inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame (1982) and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (2012), and is consistently ranked among the greatest guitarists of all time. His innovative blend of blues, soul, and rock continues to inspire musicians worldwide.[1][2]
