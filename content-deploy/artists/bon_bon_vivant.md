## Biography
Bon Bon Vivant is a genre-blending band hailing from New Orleans, Louisiana, known for their energetic live performances and unique fusion of indie, gypsy jazz, Americana, and dark ballads. The group was founded by songwriter and frontwoman Abigail Cosio and her husband, saxophonist and vocalist Jeremy Kelley, with Abigail’s sister Glori Cosio contributing signature harmonies. The band’s roots trace back to California, where the Cosio sisters grew up singing together, before Abigail and Jeremy met in Los Angeles in 2004 and began performing as a duo. In 2009, they relocated to New Orleans, where they joined forces with Glori and local musicians Ry D’Antonio, Ryan Brown, and Mike Robbins, officially forming Bon Bon Vivant.

Bon Bon Vivant quickly became a standout act in the vibrant New Orleans music scene, captivating audiences with their fearless blend of genres and emotionally charged storytelling. Their music pays homage to the city’s bawdy traditions while infusing indie rock grit and klezmer influences, creating a sound that is both jubilant and melancholic. Their debut EP, 'Evangeline,' and their 2016 full-length album, 'Paint & Pageantry,' established them as local favorites, and they have since been recognized as Best Emerging Artist of 2018 by OffBeat Magazine. The band’s performances at major festivals such as Jazz Fest, French Quarter Fest, and Bayou Boogaloo have further cemented their reputation for high-energy, communal shows that celebrate life’s contradictions.

At the heart of Bon Bon Vivant’s appeal is their commitment to storytelling and connection. Abigail Cosio’s songwriting is lauded for its wit, emotional depth, and occasional macabre edge, drawing comparisons to artists like Amy Winehouse and Florence and The Machine. The band’s music and philosophy reflect the spirit of New Orleans itself: a celebration of revelry, resilience, and the beauty found in life’s fleeting moments.
