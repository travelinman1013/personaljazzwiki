## Biography
Milton Nascimento, born on October 26, 1942, in Rio de Janeiro and raised in Três Pontas, Minas Gerais, is celebrated as one of Brazil’s most influential singer-songwriters and multi-instrumentalists. Adopted at a young age, he was immersed in music through his mother, who sang in choirs, and his father, who ran a local radio station where Milton worked as a DJ, exposing him to a vast array of genres from samba to jazz. His early experiences in the rural landscape of Minas Gerais deeply shaped his melancholic and evocative musical style, distinct from the upbeat rhythms of Rio’s samba scene[4][5].

Nascimento’s career took off after moving to Belo Horizonte at 19, where he formed pivotal collaborations with local musicians, notably leading to the creation of the influential collective and album 'Clube da Esquina' with Lô Borges and others in 1972. His breakthrough came when Elis Regina recorded his song 'Canção do Sal' in 1966, followed by a standout performance at the International Song Festival in 1967. Over his prolific career, Nascimento has blended Brazilian folk, African rhythms, European classical, bossa nova, and jazz, developing a unique falsetto and lyrical depth that address themes of love, childhood, and social justice[1][2][3][4].

With more than 30 albums and multiple Grammy and Brazilian Music Awards, Nascimento’s legacy is marked by his innovative approach to MPB (Música Popular Brasileira), his role in shaping the sound of modern Brazilian music, and his collaborations with international artists such as Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, and Pat Metheny. His music continues to inspire generations, both in Brazil and worldwide, for its emotional resonance and genre-defying creativity[1][3][4].
