## Biography
Grupo Fantasma is a pioneering Latin funk orchestra formed in 2000 in Austin, Texas, emerging from the merger of two local acts, The Blue Noise Band and The Blimp. The group was founded by Adrian Quesada, Greg Gonzalez, and Beto Martinez, who, along with other mostly Mexican-American musicians from Laredo, Texas, were inspired by classic Colombian cumbia records and sought to revitalize the genre with a modern twist. Their early performances quickly established them as a force in Austin’s vibrant music scene, known for their electrifying live shows and genre-blending sound that fuses cumbia, funk, rock, and Latin alternative influences.[1][2][6]

Over the years, Grupo Fantasma expanded its lineup to a nine- to eleven-piece ensemble and became renowned for its high-energy performances and innovative arrangements. Their music has garnered critical acclaim, including a Grammy win for their self-produced album 'El Existential' and a nomination for 'Sonidos Gold.' The band has performed at major international festivals such as Bonnaroo, Austin City Limits, and the Montreal Jazz Festival, and has served as a backing band for Prince, notably at his 3121 Club in Las Vegas and on national television. Their commitment to musical excellence and social commentary is evident in albums like 'American Music, Vol. 7,' which addresses contemporary political issues while maintaining their signature sound.[1][2][4]

Grupo Fantasma’s legacy is marked by their role as innovators in the Latin genre, continually defying categorization and earning accolades including induction into the Austin Music Hall of Fame. Their influence extends beyond their own recordings, as members have launched side projects like Brownout and Money Chicha, further shaping the landscape of Latin alternative music in the United States.[4][5]
