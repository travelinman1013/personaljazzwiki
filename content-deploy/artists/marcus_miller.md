## Biography
William Henry Marcus Miller Jr. was born on June 14, 1959, in Brooklyn, New York, into a deeply musical family that included his father William Miller, a church organist and choir director, and his cousin Wynton Kelly, a renowned jazz pianist. By age 13, Marcus had become proficient on clarinet, piano, and bass guitar, and was already composing original songs. This early classical training and immersion in jazz fundamentals set the stage for what would become one of the most versatile and influential careers in modern music. Miller spent approximately 15 years working as a session musician and sideman in New York City, during which time he honed his craft as both a performer and arranger while observing how seasoned band leaders operated. His work during this period included playing bass and writing music for jazz flautist Bobbi Humphrey and keyboardist Lonnie Liston Smith, establishing himself as a reliable and innovative studio musician.

Miller's breakthrough came in the mid-1980s when he transitioned from session work to prominence as a solo artist and producer. He released his first solo albums, *Suddenly* (1983) and *Marcus Miller* (1984), establishing himself as a funk and R&B vocalist, though he would become far more renowned for his instrumental work. His most significant early achievement was becoming the main songwriter and producer for Miles Davis's comeback albums *Tutu* (1986), *Music from Siesta* (1987), and *Amandla* (1989)—a full-circle moment given that his cousin Wynton Kelly had played on Davis's epochal 1959 album. Miller's innovative approach to bass playing revolutionized the instrument, pioneering techniques that would be emulated by subsequent generations of musicians. He has played bass on over 500 recordings across genres including jazz, R&B, soul, and pop, collaborating with artists ranging from Luther Vandross and Herbie Hancock to Michael Jackson, Beyoncé, and Frank Sinatra.

Throughout his career spanning over four decades, Miller has maintained an extraordinary balance between collaborative work and solo leadership. He was a member of the *Saturday Night Live* band (1978-1979), served as musical director and house band bassist for a music performance program, and participated in high-profile supergroups including Legends (1997) with Eric Clapton, Joe Sample, David Sanborn, and Steve Gadd, and SMV (2008) with fellow bassists Stanley Clarke and Victor Wooten. His accolades include two GRAMMY Awards, Holland's Edison Award for Lifetime Achievement in Jazz (2013), France's Victoire du Jazz (2010), and appointment as a UNESCO Artist for Peace (2013). Miller won the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (NARAS) 'Most Valuable Player' award three consecutive years for his studio work and was subsequently granted 'player emeritus' status. He has released 13 solo albums as a leader and continues to tour extensively throughout Europe, Japan, and internationally, maintaining his position as one of the most significant and influential bass players in jazz, fusion, funk, R&B, and soul music.
