## Biography
Cedric Burnside, Sharde Thomas-Malloy, and Tierinii Jackson form a collaborative group rooted in the Mississippi Hill Country blues tradition, blending percussion, vocals, and blues elements for projects like the soundtrack to the film 'Sinners.' Cedric Burnside, the core member, was born on August 26, 1978, in Memphis, Tennessee, and raised in Ashland, Mississippi, as part of the prominent Burnside musical dynasty known for rural blues and juke joint R&B.[3][4][5] A Grammy-winning artist (2022 winner for 'I Be Trying,' with three nominations total) and 2021 NEA National Heritage Fellow, Burnside emerged in the 1990s as a drummer and guitarist, carrying forward the hypnotic, driving style of Hill Country blues.[6][7][8]

Sharde Thomas-Malloy and Tierinii Jackson join Burnside in this ensemble, contributing to its dynamic sound, with Burnside providing masterful percussion and the group uniting for contemporary blues recordings tied to media like the 'Sinners' movie.[1][2][3] Their collaboration showcases a lively mix of classic blues, modern blues, blues rock, and country blues, as reflected in Spotify data, emphasizing new songwriting and performances that honor Delta traditions.[1][2]
