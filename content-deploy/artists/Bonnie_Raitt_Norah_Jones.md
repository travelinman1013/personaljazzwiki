## Biography
Bonnie Raitt, born November 8, 1949, in Burbank, California, is an acclaimed American singer, songwriter, and guitarist renowned for her unique blend of blues, rock, folk, and country. Raised in a musical family—her father was Broadway star John Raitt—she began playing guitar as a teenager and was deeply influenced by the blues revival of the 1960s. Raitt attended Radcliffe College, where she became immersed in the Cambridge folk and blues scene, learning directly from blues legends and honing her signature slide guitar style.

Raitt released her self-titled debut album in 1971, quickly earning critical praise for her soulful voice and exceptional guitar work, though commercial success was initially modest. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, she built a reputation as a powerful live performer and respected session musician, collaborating with artists like Warren Zevon, Little Feat, and John Prine. Her major breakthrough came with the 1989 album 'Nick of Time,' which won the Grammy for Album of the Year and topped the Billboard 200. Subsequent albums, including 'Luck of the Draw' and 'Longing in Their Hearts,' produced hits like 'Something to Talk About' and 'I Can't Make You Love Me,' cementing her legacy as a leading figure in American roots music.

Over her five-decade career, Raitt has earned 13 Grammy Awards, a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, and induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. She is celebrated for her expressive slide guitar technique, emotive vocal delivery, and advocacy for social and environmental causes. In 2022, her song 'Just Like That' won the Grammy for Song of the Year, underscoring her enduring relevance and artistry.
