## Biography
Lake Street Dive is an American multi-genre band formed in 2004 by four students at the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston: Rachael Price (lead vocals), Mike 'McDuck' Olson (trumpet, guitar), Bridget Kearney (upright bass), and Mike Calabrese (drums). The band’s name was inspired by Lake Street in Minneapolis, a nod to Olson’s hometown and its array of dive bars. Initially conceived as a 'free country band,' the group quickly shifted toward a more accessible and genre-blending sound, drawing from jazz, soul, pop, and rock influences. 

Lake Street Dive’s early years were marked by grassroots touring and self-released albums, with their debut 'In This Episode...' arriving in 2006. Their breakthrough came via viral video covers, notably a funk-infused take on The Jackson 5’s 'I Want You Back,' which showcased their inventive arrangements and Price’s dynamic vocals. The band’s relentless touring and energetic live shows built a devoted following, leading to a deal with Signature Sounds and later Nonesuch Records. Their 2016 album 'Side Pony' debuted at No. 1 on three Billboard charts, solidifying their reputation for sophisticated musicianship and genre-defying songwriting. 

Over the years, Lake Street Dive has evolved both in sound and lineup, with keyboardist Akie Bermiss joining in 2017 and guitarist James Cornelison in 2021 after Olson’s departure. The group is celebrated for their tight harmonies, inventive covers, and original songs that blend retro soul, jazz, and pop. Their legacy lies in their ability to transcend genre boundaries while maintaining a strong sense of camaraderie and musical curiosity, inspiring a new generation of musicians with their eclectic approach.
