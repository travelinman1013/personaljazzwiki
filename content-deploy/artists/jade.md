## Biography
Jade Amelia Thirlwall is an English singer and songwriter born on December 26, 1992, in South Shields, Tyne & Wear, England. She began singing at age six and decided to pursue music professionally after performing in front of her school. Her breakthrough came through multiple auditions for The X Factor UK, first attempting at age 15 in 2008 with Whitney Houston's 'Where Do Broken Hearts Go', advancing to bootcamp before elimination. After two unsuccessful returns, she auditioned for the show's eighth series in 2011 at age 18, performing 'I Want to Hold Your Hand' by The Beatles. Though initially eliminated at bootcamp, she was brought back as part of a four-piece group that would become Little Mix, making them the first group to win The X Factor UK competition.

As a member of Little Mix from 2011 to 2022, Thirlwall achieved remarkable commercial success, contributing to six studio albums and nineteen UK top-ten singles, five of which reached number one. The group became the first girl group to win the Brit Award for British Group, establishing themselves as one of the best-selling girl groups of all time. During her time with Little Mix, Thirlwall co-wrote several notable songs including 'Joan of Arc' and 'Nothing But My Feelings' for the albums LM5 and Confetti respectively. In 2022, she signed a solo record deal with RCA Records, marking the beginning of her solo career.

Thirlwall's solo debut single 'Angel of My Dreams', released in July 2024, achieved critical acclaim and reached number seven on the UK Singles Chart, earning a nomination for Song of the Year at the 2025 Brit Awards. She continued building momentum with singles 'Fantasy' and 'FUFN (F*ck You For Now)', the latter becoming a Top 40 hit. Her debut solo album That's Showbiz Baby was released on September 12, 2025, debuting at number three on the UK Albums Chart to critical acclaim. At the 2025 Brit Awards held on March 1, 2025, Thirlwall won Best Pop Act, beating competition from Charli XCX, Dua Lipa, Lola Young, and Myles Smith. She has also performed at major festivals, including Glastonbury Festival on June 28, 2025.
