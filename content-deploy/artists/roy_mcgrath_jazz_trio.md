## Biography
Roy McGrath is a Chicago-based tenor saxophonist, composer, and bandleader born and raised in San Juan, Puerto Rico. His Irish last name comes from his Mexican-American father, who met his Irish-German mother in Puerto Rico. He sang in school choirs before picking up the saxophone at age 16 and attended the Berklee College of Music Summer program, followed by education in Boston, New Orleans, and other locations.[2][3][4][7][8]

McGrath has developed a career blending jazz, Latin, and pop styles, staying connected to his Puerto Rican heritage through compositions and performances that reinterpret classics from the island, such as tunes by Antonio Caban Vale. Based in Chicago, known for blues, he leads ensembles that homage Puerto Rican music with idiomatic brilliance, featuring precise melodies, harmonies, and rhythms. A Latin Grammy-nominated artist, he has released albums like Menjunje in 2025, showcasing his vision with talented musicians.[1][5][6]

His musical style reflects a melting pot of traditions, rarely straying from his roots despite influences from various genres and cities. Leading from the front without overpowering his band, McGrath's work flows with vocal elegance and sincerity, contributing to Latin jazz through bandleading and reinterpretations of cultural classics.[1][8]
