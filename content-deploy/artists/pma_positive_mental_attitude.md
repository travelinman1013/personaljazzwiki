## Biography
There is no evidence of a distinct musical artist or group formally known as 'PMA (Positive Mental Attitude)' in credible music databases, biographical sources, or reputable media coverage. The term 'PMA'—short for Positive Mental Attitude—originates from the philosophy popularized by Napoleon Hill in his 1937 book 'Think and Grow Rich' and was later adopted as a core ethos by the influential punk band Bad Brains in the early 1980s. The phrase became a rallying cry within punk and hardcore communities, symbolizing resilience, optimism, and self-empowerment, but it does not refer to a specific artist or band with a documented career, discography, or biographical narrative.

Instead, 'PMA' is best understood as a cultural and philosophical concept that has deeply influenced the punk and hardcore music scenes, with its most prominent musical association being through Bad Brains and their frontman H.R. The phrase appears in their 1982 song 'Attitude' and has since been referenced by numerous artists as a guiding principle. Various musicians, such as Jesse Malin and John Joseph, have cited PMA as a source of inspiration in their personal lives and creative work, but there is no standalone artist or group by this name with an individual legacy or catalog.
