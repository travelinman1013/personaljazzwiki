## Biography
John Scofield & Dave Holland is a collaborative duo project uniting two of modern jazz’s most distinctive voices: American guitarist John Scofield and English bassist Dave Holland. Both emerged from the post-1960s jazz vanguard—Holland through his early work with Miles Davis and the European avant‑garde, Scofield through the New York fusion and post‑bop scenes—and each went on to become a major bandleader and composer in his own right.[2][5][8][9] Although they crossed paths for decades in larger ensembles, including projects with Herbie Hancock and Joe Henderson, their musical partnership as an intimate guitar–bass duo only crystallized in the 2020s after years of mutual respect and occasional collaboration.[1][2][5]

Before formally branding themselves as a duo, Scofield and Holland built a substantial shared history. They recorded together on Joe Henderson’s 1993 Miles Davis tribute *So Near, So Far (Musings for Miles)* and co‑led the all‑star quartet ScoLoHoFo with saxophonist Joe Lovano and drummer Al Foster, which released the acclaimed album *Oh!* in 2003 and toured extensively.[1][2][4][5] Their paths also intersected in settings led by Herbie Hancock, and they developed a deep rapport rooted in Holland’s sophisticated, groove‑savvy writing and Scofield’s blues‑tinged, harmonically adventurous guitar style.[1][2][4] After a planned duo tour was canceled in 2020 due to the pandemic, they resumed in late 2021 and again in 2024, finding that the stripped‑down format highlighted their shared love of swing, blues feeling, and lyrical improvisation.[3][5][6]

The duo’s first dedicated album, *Memories of Home* (ECM, 2025), documents this mature partnership in a pure, unadorned setting: Scofield on Ibanez AS200 electric guitar and Holland on double bass, with no effects or studio embellishment.[2][4][5][6] The record revisits and reimagines material from both artists’ catalogs—Holland pieces such as “Not for Nothin’,” “You I Love,” and the title track “Memories of Home,” alongside Scofield compositions including “Easy for You,” “Mine Are Blues,” and “Memorette”—recasting earlier ensemble works as intimate conversations between two master improvisers.[2][4][6] Critics have noted how Holland’s deep tone, impeccable time, and composerly sense of form meet Scofield’s wry melodic sense, elastic phrasing, and subtle deployment of blues, country, and rock inflections, yielding music that is at once minimalist in texture and rich in detail.[2][4][5][6] While each artist’s individual legacy in jazz is vast, the John Scofield & Dave Holland duo stands as a late‑career summit—an exploration of memory, song craft, and interactive improvisation that extends the lineage of classic guitar–bass pairings into the 21st century.[2][4][5][6]

## Fun Facts
- Although Dave Holland has a long history of duo recordings with musicians like Derek Bailey, Barre Phillips, Sam Rivers, Pepe Habichuela, and Kenny Barron, *Memories of Home* is the first time he and John Scofield have released a dedicated duo album together, despite decades of collaboration in other settings.[1][2][5][6]
- A full Scofield–Holland duo tour was originally scheduled for 2020 but had to be scrapped because of the COVID‑19 pandemic; the concept was revived in late 2021 and later tours, eventually leading to the recording of *Memories of Home*.[3][5][6]
- The title track “Memories of Home” is a Holland composition that originally appeared on a 1980s project with progressive bluegrass musicians Vassar Clements and John Hartford; in the duo version, Scofield brings out the tune’s country and bluegrass flavor on electric guitar while Holland adds subtle jazz inflections.[2][4][6]
- On *Memories of Home*, both musicians revisit earlier pieces from their catalogs—such as Scofield’s ballad “Easy for You” from his 1993 album *What We Do* and Holland’s quintet tunes “Not for Nothin’” and “You I Love”—stripping them down to guitar and bass to highlight melody, swing, and dialogue.[2][4][6]
