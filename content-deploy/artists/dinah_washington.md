## Biography
Dinah Washington was born Ruth Lee Jones on August 29, 1924, in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, and became one of the most versatile and influential female vocalists in American popular music history.[1][2] She began her musical career singing and playing piano in church, where she developed her distinctive high-pitched, penetrating voice marked by crystal-clear enunciation and absolute clarity of diction.[1][3] In 1943, talent agent Joe Glaser introduced her to bandleader Lionel Hampton, who was so impressed with her abilities that he hired her as his female band vocalist. During her three years with Hampton's orchestra (1943-1946), she recorded her first major hit, "Evil Gal Blues," and acquired her stage name from club owner Joe Sherman at the Garrick nightclub in Chicago.[1][2]

After leaving Hampton's band in 1946, Washington launched a highly successful solo career with Mercury Records, establishing herself as the "Queen of the Blues" through her remarkable versatility across gospel, jazz, blues, rhythm-and-blues, and pop music.[1][3] Between 1948 and 1955, she achieved 27 R&B top-10 hits, making her one of the most popular recording artists of the era.[1] Her career reached its commercial peak in 1959 with "What a Difference a Day Makes," a Grammy Award-winning crossover hit that reached number 4 on the US pop charts and introduced her artistry to mainstream audiences.[1][2] Throughout the late 1950s and early 1960s, she performed at prestigious venues including the Newport Jazz Festival, Birdland, and collaborated with legendary musicians including Count Basie, Duke Ellington, and arranger Quincy Jones.[1][4]

Washington's legacy was defined by her extraordinary ability to interpret any musical style with emotional depth and technical mastery, as evidenced by her successful recordings spanning from Fats Waller standards to Hank Williams' country classics.[3] Her gritty, salty vocal delivery combined with her dramatic timing and unsentimental approach to torch songs influenced generations of female vocalists.[1][3] She passed away on December 14, 1963, at age 39 from an accidental overdose of diet pills and alcohol, but her influence endured through her induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993 and the Alabama Jazz Hall of Fame in 1986.[2][3]

## Fun Facts
- Washington gave herself the title "Queen of the Blues" with complete confidence in her own abilities, and this self-bestowed nickname became her defining moniker throughout her career.[3][4]
- Known for her bold personality, Washington famously told an audience at the London Palladium: "There is but one heaven, one hell, one queen, and your [Queen] Elizabeth is an imposter."[2]
- Washington was married at least seven times and once quipped, "I change husbands before they change me," reflecting her independent spirit and turbulent personal life that informed her emotionally complex torch song interpretations.[2][3]
- Quincy Jones described Washington's vocal mastery with poetic precision: "Dinah had a voice that was like the pipes of life. She could take any melody in her hand and hold it like an egg, crack it open, fry it, let it sizzle, reconstruct it, put the egg back in the box and back in the refrigerator, and you would've still understood every single syllable of every single word of everything she sang."[4]
