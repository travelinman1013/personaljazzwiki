## Biography
Roebuck "Pops" Staples (December 28, 1914 – December 19, 2000) was a foundational figure in American gospel, blues, and R&B music. Born the youngest of 14 children on a cotton plantation near Winona, Mississippi, he was deeply influenced by the sounds of the Delta, learning guitar from local blues legends like Charley Patton, Robert Johnson, and Son House. After moving to Chicago in 1935, Pops worked various jobs while singing with gospel groups, eventually forming The Staple Singers in 1948 with his wife Oceola and their children Cleotha, Pervis, Yvonne, and Mavis.

The Staple Singers began as a church gospel group but soon gained national attention for their unique blend of gospel, blues, folk, and later soul and funk. Pops's tremolo-rich guitar and warm baritone, often paired with Mavis's powerful vocals, became hallmarks of the group's sound. Their music evolved to address social issues, aligning closely with the civil rights movement through "message songs" like "Respect Yourself" and "I'll Take You There." Pops continued to perform and record into his later years, earning critical acclaim for solo albums such as "Peace to the Neighborhood" and the Grammy-winning "Father Father."

Pops Staples's legacy is profound: he helped bring gospel music into the mainstream, influenced generations of musicians across genres, and was honored with induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. His commitment to peace, equality, and brotherhood, expressed through both his music and activism, cements his status as a pivotal figure in 20th-century American music.
