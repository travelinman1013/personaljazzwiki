## Biography
Percy Mayfield, born August 12, 1920, in Minden, Louisiana, earned the nickname 'Poet Laureate of the Blues' for his deeply introspective and poetic songwriting. As a child, he wrote poems and set them to music, but his mother’s disapproval of blues meant he sang only in church. Leaving home at 15, Mayfield traveled across the country before settling in Los Angeles in 1942, where he began to establish himself in the postwar R&B scene. His breakthrough came in 1950 with the poignant ballad 'Please Send Me Someone to Love,' which topped the R&B charts and showcased his ability to blend melancholy with social commentary[1][2][3].

Mayfield’s career as a performer was tragically curtailed by a serious automobile accident in 1952 that left him permanently disfigured, but he continued to record and, more notably, became a prolific songwriter for other artists. His greatest commercial success came as a staff writer for Ray Charles in the early 1960s, penning classics such as 'Hit the Road, Jack,' 'Hide Nor Hair,' and 'At the Club.' Mayfield’s songs were recorded by a wide range of artists, including B.B. King, Brook Benton, Esther Phillips, and Elvis Presley. He remained active as a songwriter and occasional performer until his death in Los Angeles on August 11, 1984, just one day before his 64th birthday[1][2][3].

Mayfield’s musical style is characterized by a smooth, understated vocal delivery and lyrics that explore themes of love, loss, and the human condition with rare sensitivity and insight. His legacy endures not only through his own recordings but also through the many artists who have interpreted his work, cementing his place as one of the most influential figures in blues and R&B songwriting[1][3].

## Fun Facts

- He survived a horrific 1952 car accident in which he was initially pronounced dead at the scene, but lived with facial disfigurement for the rest of his life[2].
- Mayfield considered himself a songwriter first and only became a singer because record companies insisted he perform his own material[4].
- His hometown of Minden, Louisiana, declared May 13th 'Percy Mayfield Day' in 2005, honoring his lasting legacy[3].
