## Biography
Dmitri Matheny, born on December 25, 1965, in Nashville, Tennessee, is an acclaimed American jazz flugelhornist, composer, educator, and recording artist. Raised in Columbus, Georgia, and Tucson, Arizona, Matheny was drawn to music early, beginning piano at age five and switching to trumpet at nine. His formative years included studies at the Brookstone School and the Interlochen Arts Academy, followed by Berklee College of Music in Boston. In the late 1980s, Matheny shifted his focus to the flugelhorn, studying privately with jazz legend Art Farmer and quickly establishing himself as a leading voice on the instrument. After moving to San Francisco in 1989, he formed the Dmitri Matheny Group and became a prominent figure in the Bay Area jazz scene, performing with major orchestras and releasing several critically acclaimed albums.

Matheny's musical style is characterized by a warm, romantic tone, lyrical improvisation, and masterful technique. His recordings, such as 'Penumbra: The Moon Sessions' and 'Starlight Cafe,' have been praised for their emotional depth and innovative arrangements. Over his career, Matheny has balanced performing with extensive work in jazz education, serving in leadership roles for organizations like SFJAZZ and the Thelonious Monk Institute. He has received numerous accolades, including being named NW Jazz Instrumentalist of the Year by Earshot Jazz in 2016 and earning recognition in DownBeat and Jazziz magazine polls. Matheny continues to tour internationally, record original works, and inspire new generations of jazz musicians.
