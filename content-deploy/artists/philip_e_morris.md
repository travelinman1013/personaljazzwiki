## Biography
Philip E. Morris, whose real name is Philip E Morris Åkerblad, was born in 1987 in Gothenburg, Sweden. He began his professional career as a composer, songwriter, and music producer in early 2011, focusing primarily on production music—instrumental tracks rich in emotions and character designed for media use. That same year, he secured his first major placements on American television shows 'Burn Notice' (Fox) and 'Pretty Little Liars' (ABC Family) through LA-based publisher Crucial Music, and established contact with Universal Music's production music department in Stockholm, leading to his inclusion in the UPPM team for the Match Music label[1].

In 2012, Morris released his first project with Universal on 'Minimal Underscores,' marking the start of ongoing collaborations with the label. His musical style centers on versatile production music across genres, though some profiles describe hip-hop influences with mellow flows, socially conscious lyrics, and blends of contemporary and electronic elements in beat collections. Albums like 'A Beat Collection, Vol. 1' (2017), 'Vol. 2' (2018), and 'Vol. 3' (2019) showcase his production skills, alongside singles such as 'Streets of Asia' and tracks like 'King of the Roads' used in Qatar Airways promotions[1][2][6].

Morris continues to release music independently via platforms like SoundCloud and Bandcamp, emphasizing emotional, character-driven instrumentals suitable for YouTube and licensing through Music Vine. His work reflects a dedication to production music that evokes specific feelings, establishing a niche in the industry without a widely documented legacy of mainstream stardom[1][3].
