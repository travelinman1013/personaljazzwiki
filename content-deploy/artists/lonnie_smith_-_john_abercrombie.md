## Biography
John Abercrombie (1944–2017) was a highly influential American jazz guitarist known for his innovative approach to both fusion and modern jazz. Born in Port Chester, New York, Abercrombie began playing guitar at the age of 14, inspired by rock and roll before gravitating toward jazz after discovering the work of Jim Hall, Wes Montgomery, and Bill Evans. He attended Berklee College of Music, where he connected with future jazz luminaries and began developing his distinctive style, blending lyrical phrasing with harmonic sophistication.

Abercrombie's career took off in the late 1960s when he joined organist Johnny Hammond Smith for his first recording session and later became a member of the jazz-rock band Dreams alongside the Brecker brothers. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Abercrombie established himself as a leading voice in jazz fusion, notably through his work with drummer Jack DeJohnette and bassist Dave Holland in the group Gateway, and his acclaimed solo debut 'Timeless' with Jan Hammer and DeJohnette. He was also a frequent collaborator with organist Dr. Lonnie Smith, recording several trio albums that showcased his versatility and deep affinity for the organ trio format.

Abercrombie's musical style evolved over the decades, moving from the fiery intensity of fusion to a more nuanced, chamber-jazz approach, particularly in his long association with ECM Records. His later work emphasized melodic clarity, subtle harmonic exploration, and a softer, more introspective tone. Abercrombie's legacy lies in his ability to bridge genres, his technical mastery, and his profound influence on subsequent generations of jazz guitarists.
