## Biography
Earl Kenneth Hines, known as Earl "Fatha" Hines, was born in 1901 and became one of the most influential jazz pianists of all time. He revolutionized piano playing in jazz by developing his trademark "trumpet-style" piano technique, which involved playing ringing octaves with his right hand to mimic the sound of a trumpet. This innovative approach was inspired by trumpeter Joe Smith and fundamentally changed how jazz piano would be played. In 1922, at age 17, Hines joined Lois B. Deppe's band in Pittsburgh, which became his first steady job earning $15 per week. This band made history as the first Black orchestra to have their music played on the radio in 1921. After moving to Chicago in the mid-1920s, Hines became a central figure in the city's vibrant jazz scene, working with Carroll Dickerson's Orchestra and forming crucial musical partnerships that would define his career.

Hines's most productive and creatively significant period came in 1928, when he recorded extensively with clarinetist Jimmy Noone and began his legendary collaborations with Louis Armstrong. Together, Armstrong and Hines created some of the most renowned records in jazz history, including the famous trumpet and piano duet "Weather Bird." Throughout the 1930s and 1940s, Hines led his own big band, which became a breeding ground for bebop innovation and launched the careers of numerous jazz legends including Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker, and Billy Eckstine. Duke Ellington later acknowledged that "the seeds of bop were in Earl Hines's piano style." In 1948, Hines joined Louis Armstrong's All-Stars, though he left in 1951 feeling constrained by Armstrong's musical approach. After a period of relative obscurity in the late 1950s, Hines experienced a remarkable career renaissance beginning in 1964 when he was booked for solo concerts at the Little Theatre in New York, leading to 19 years of intensive touring, recording over 100 albums, and collaborating with jazz luminaries worldwide.

William Randolph "Cozy" Cole was born on October 17, 1909, and became a pioneering jazz drummer who broke significant racial barriers in American music. Cole was the first Black musician hired on a network musical staff when CBS radio employed him to work with Raymond Scott in 1943. Throughout his long career, Cole worked as a sideman for major bandleaders including Cab Calloway, Lionel Hampton, and Louis Armstrong, and he was featured in the 1943 Broadway show "Carmen Jones" with his name on the program—a rare honor for a drummer at that time. In 1944, Cole collaborated with Benny Goodman leading a small group at the Onyx Club in New York, and in 1953, he co-founded The Krupa And Cole Drum School with Gene Krupa. Cole remained active throughout the 1960s and 1970s, reuniting with longtime friend Jonah Jones for touring and recording. He received an honorary degree of Doctor of Musical Arts from Capital University in 1978 and later earned a degree in lecturer studies from the same institution.
