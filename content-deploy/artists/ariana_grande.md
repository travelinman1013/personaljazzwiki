## Biography
Ariana Grande-Butera is an American singer, songwriter, and actress born on June 26, 1993, in Boca Raton, Florida, to graphic designer Joan Grande and businessman Edward Butera.[1][2] She began performing at a young age in local theater and with the South Florida Philharmonic, appearing in productions such as Annie before making her professional breakthrough at age 15 as Charlotte in the 2008 Broadway musical 13, for which she won a National Youth Theatre Association Award.[1][2] In 2010 she gained widespread recognition on Nickelodeon as Cat Valentine in the teen sitcom Victorious and later its spin‑off Sam & Cat, roles that showcased her comic timing and powerful vocal range and established her as a young TV star.[1][2]

While acting, Grande was simultaneously developing a recording career, contributing vocals to the Victorious soundtracks and posting covers online, which led to a deal with Republic Records in 2011.[1][4] Her debut album Yours Truly (2013), blending pop and R&B with a strong 1990s influence, debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and drew critical comparisons between her four‑octave, whistle‑register voice and Mariah Carey’s.[2][4] She quickly followed with My Everything (2014), Dangerous Woman (2016), Sweetener (2018), Thank U, Next (2019), Positions (2020), and Eternal Sunshine (2024), scoring numerous worldwide hits including “The Way,” “Problem,” “Bang Bang,” “Side to Side,” “No Tears Left to Cry,” “Thank U, Next,” “7 Rings,” and “Positions.”[1][2] Her style is rooted in pop and contemporary R&B with elements of trap, EDM, and hip‑hop, characterized by melismatic vocals, whistle tones, and confessional lyrics that increasingly address grief, relationships, and self‑empowerment.[1][2]

Across her career Grande has become one of the defining pop artists of the 2010s and 2020s, earning multiple Grammy Awards, more than a dozen Grammy nominations, and numerous chart records, including several number‑one debuts on the Billboard Hot 100.[1][2] She headlined major tours such as The Honeymoon Tour and the Sweetener World Tour and, in 2019, became at the time the youngest artist to headline Coachella.[1] Beyond music, she returned to high‑profile acting with her role as Glinda in the 2024 film adaptation of Wicked, which earned her Academy Award and Golden Globe nominations and reinforced her versatility as both a vocalist and musical theater performer.[1] Her influence extends to vocal performance standards in contemporary pop, the resurgence of powerhouse, R&B‑inflected female pop vocals, and a generation of younger artists citing her as a model for blending social media presence, personal storytelling, and technical vocal skill.

## Fun Facts
- Before her TV fame, Ariana Grande’s first major professional role was on Broadway, playing Charlotte in the musical 13 at just 15 years old.[1][2]
- Her breakout Nickelodeon character Cat Valentine required her to dye her hair bright red so often that it caused significant damage, leading to her later signature high ponytail as a more protective style.[1]
- Grande became, at the time, the youngest artist ever to headline the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival when she led the 2019 lineup at age 25.[1]
- Her performance as Glinda in the 2024 film adaptation of Wicked earned her both Academy Award and Golden Globe nominations for best supporting actress, signaling a major return to musical theater–style acting.[1]
