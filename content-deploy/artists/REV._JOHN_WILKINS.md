## Biography
Reverend John Wilkins was born in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1943, to Reverend Robert Wilkins, a pre-war blues musician. He began playing guitar at the age of five alongside his father in church, describing his ability as a 'gift from God.' By nine, Wilkins was performing with gospel groups around Memphis, and as a teenager, he incorporated blues into his repertoire, playing at local juke joints on weekends while continuing to play gospel on Sundays. He also participated in sessions at Stax Records. In his adult life, Wilkins chose to focus on gospel music, becoming the pastor of Hunter's Chapel Missionary Baptist Church in Como, Mississippi, starting in 1985. His music blended elements of blues and gospel, reflecting his roots and spiritual commitment. Wilkins' career gained momentum in the 2000s, with him touring nationally and internationally alongside his daughters, who provided backing vocals. His album *Trouble* was released shortly before his passing in 2023 at the age of 76, following a prolonged battle with COVID-19 and its aftereffects.
