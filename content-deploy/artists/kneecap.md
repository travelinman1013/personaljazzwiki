## Biography
Kneecap are an Irish hip hop trio formed in Belfast, Northern Ireland, consisting of rappers Mo Chara (Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh), Móglaí Bap (Naoise Ó Cairealláin), and DJ/producer DJ Próvaí (J. J. Ó Dochartaigh).[1][4] Mo Chara and Móglaí Bap both come from West Belfast, while DJ Próvaí is from Derry, and all three emerged from the Irish‑language community, meeting through Irish-language cultural spaces such as the Cultúrlann in West Belfast and a network of youth clubs, schools, and social events that promoted the language and local republican culture.[1][2][3] Their formation in the late 2010s was closely tied to this grassroots scene and to the political history of Northern Ireland; they grew up in communities shaped by the Troubles and by resistance to British rule, which gave their work a strongly politicised, anti‑colonial perspective from the outset.[3][4]

Kneecap’s breakthrough came with their 2017 debut single “C.E.A.R.T.A.” (“cearta” meaning “rights”), inspired by an incident in which Móglaí Bap and a friend sprayed the Irish word for “rights” on a Belfast bus stop ahead of an Irish‑language rights march; after his friend was arrested and refused to speak English to police, the episode became the basis for the song, recorded in Móglaí Bap’s bedroom.[1][4] They quickly developed a reputation for raucous live shows and for rapping in a fluid mix of Irish and English, blending hard‑hitting trap and punk‑rap sonics with dark humour and sharp political commentary about post‑Troubles life in the North.[1][2][3][4] Their first full‑length project, *3CAG* (2018)—a title referencing an Irish slang term for MDMA meaning “three consonants and a vowel”—was later praised as an irreverent, high‑energy fusion of bilingual lyricism and club‑ready beats, capturing nights out, drug culture, and local street life alongside critiques of state power and sectarian divisions.[1][2]

Through relentless touring and increasingly visible political stances—supporting Irish republicanism, language rights, and international solidarity causes such as Palestinian refugees—Kneecap became one of the most prominent voices in Irish-language popular music.[1][3][4] In 2024 they released their studio album *Fine Art* and simultaneously fronted a semi‑fictional biographical film, *Kneecap*, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival as the first Irish‑language film ever screened there and won the Audience Award: NEXT, significantly raising their international profile.[1][3] Celebrated by high‑profile admirers including Noel Gallagher, Elton John, Ed Sheeran, and Cillian Murphy, the group have helped reposition Irish‑language hip hop from a niche subculture to a globally discussed movement, cementing a legacy as boundary‑pushing artists who merge party‑centric rap, local folklore, and radical politics while normalising the Irish language in contemporary youth culture.[3][4]

## Fun Facts
- The group’s name, Kneecap, evokes the history of paramilitary punishment shootings in Northern Ireland, reflecting their dark humour and politically charged edge, though they present it in a tongue-in-cheek, subversive way.[4]
- Their debut single “C.E.A.R.T.A.” was recorded in Móglaí Bap’s bedroom using GarageBand, which Mo Chara later jokingly called “possibly the worst software for making music,” yet the track became their breakout.[4]
- Before going full-time with Kneecap, DJ Próvaí worked as a school teacher and only left the job in 2020 after his school was alerted to a performance video in which he had the phrase “Brits Out” written on his buttocks onstage.[1][2]
- The 2024 film *Kneecap* became the first ever Irish-language movie to screen at the Sundance Film Festival and the first non‑U.S. film to win the Audience Award: NEXT, greatly amplifying the group’s global profile.[3]

## Musical Connections

### Mentors/Influences
- [[gearóid_ó_cairealláin|Gearóid Ó Cairealláin]] - Irish-language activist, radio founder, and cultural organiser; father of Móglaí Bap and a key figure in establishing Irish-language schools, youth clubs, and the Cultúrlann cultural centre that shaped the band’s upbringing. (Founding work on Irish-language schools (Naíscoils), youth clubs, and the Cultúrlann cultural centre and radio projects in West Belfast that nurtured the Irish-language community from which Kneecap emerged.) [1980s–2000s community work; influence on Kneecap throughout their youth and career.[3]]
- [[irish-language_teachers_and_community_activists_in_belfast_and_derry|Irish-language teachers and community activists in Belfast and Derry]] - Teachers and activists who built Irish-language nursery schools (Naíscoils) and community structures after the conflict in the North; cited by DJ Próvaí as role models who defended and sustained their communities. (Creation of Naíscoils, Irish-language schools, youth clubs, and cultural programmes that normalised Irish as a living urban language and created the social spaces where the band members met.) [Post‑Troubles era, especially 1990s–2010s, influencing the members’ education and political consciousness.[3]]
- [[global_hip_hop_tradition|Global hip hop tradition]] - The group cite hip hop—particularly its role as a storytelling vehicle for marginalised Black communities in the US—as a conceptual and stylistic template for using rap to give voice to an ignored community in the North of Ireland. (Broad influence of US hip hop’s narrative, political, and community-focused approaches rather than specific albums; they frame their own work as a parallel act of storytelling and resistance.) [Influence acknowledged across Kneecap’s output from their 2017 debut onwards.[3]]

- [[mo_chara_liam_óg_ó_hannaidh|Mo Chara (Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh)]] - Co‑founding rapper and frontman of Kneecap; collaborates on all songwriting, performances, and public activism within the group.

- [[móglaí_bap_naoise_ó_cairealláin|Móglaí Bap (Naoise Ó Cairealláin)]] - Co‑founding rapper and frontman; his personal experiences and family background in Irish-language activism strongly inform the group’s lyrics and image. (Originated “C.E.A.R.T.A.” concept; central to *3CAG*, *Fine Art*, and the film *Kneecap*; early home-recorded tracks made in his bedroom.) [2017–present.[1][3][4]]
- [[dj_próvaí_j._j._ó_dochartaigh|DJ Próvaí (J. J. Ó Dochartaigh)]] - Producer, DJ, and third core member; previously a teacher who left the profession in 2020 to focus on music production, crafting the group’s blend of punk-rap, trap, and club sounds. (*3CAG*, *Fine Art*, numerous singles and live shows; central onscreen role in the *Kneecap* film.) [Joined the live and creative mix as performer and producer in the late 2010s; full-time musician from 2020 onward.[1][2][3]]

### Artists Influenced
- [[emerging_irish-language_and_irish-based_rap_artists_collective_category|Emerging Irish-language and Irish-based rap artists (collective category)]] - Critics and interviewers credit Kneecap with helping to normalise Irish-language rap and inspiring younger artists to treat the language as a viable medium for contemporary hip hop and club music. (Influence is cultural rather than on specific named tracks—through the visibility of Irish-language projects like *3CAG*, *Fine Art*, and the film *Kneecap*, and their high-profile tours and media presence.) [Late 2010s–2020s; particularly after their international breakthrough around 2023–2024.[1][3][4]]
