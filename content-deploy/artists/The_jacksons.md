## Biography
The Jacksons, originally known as The Jackson 5, are an iconic American family music group formed in Gary, Indiana in 1964. The group was founded by Joseph Jackson, who managed his sons Jackie, Tito, and Jermaine before younger brothers Marlon and Michael joined, transforming the act into a quintet. Their early years were marked by rigorous rehearsals under their father's strict guidance, leading to local talent show victories and a debut at Harlem's Apollo Theater. Their breakthrough came after signing with Motown Records in 1969, where they quickly became a sensation, making history as the first act to have their first four major label singles reach No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100.

The Jacksons' musical style evolved from R&B and soul to incorporate pop, funk, and disco, reflecting broader trends in American popular music. Their energetic performances, tight harmonies, and charismatic stage presence—especially that of lead singer Michael Jackson—helped them cross racial boundaries and achieve international stardom. After leaving Motown in 1975 due to creative differences, they rebranded as The Jacksons, signed with Epic Records, and began writing and producing their own material, further solidifying their influence on the music industry. Their success continued into the 1980s with hits like "Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)" and "Can You Feel It."

The Jacksons' legacy is profound: they not only launched the solo careers of Michael and Jermaine Jackson but also set the template for future boy bands and pop groups. Their impact on music, dance, and pop culture remains enduring, and they are celebrated as Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees with a catalog of chart-topping albums and singles that have inspired generations of artists.
