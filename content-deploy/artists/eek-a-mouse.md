## Biography
Ripton Joseph Hylton, known as Eek-A-Mouse, was born on November 19, 1957, in Kingston, Jamaica, in the notorious Trench Town ghetto. He displayed musical talent from childhood, singing with his mother and performing at school concerts, initially as a roots reggae singer. While in college, he released his first two roots reggae singles under his real name, produced by his mathematics tutor Mr. Dehaney and influenced by Pablo Moses. He worked with various sound systems like Papa Roots, Black Ark, Gemini, Jah Life, Black Scorpio, and Virgo before adopting the stage name 'Eek-A-Mouse' in 1979, inspired by a racehorse he bet on.[1][2][3][4]

Eek-A-Mouse pioneered the 'singjay' style, blending singing and deejaying with a unique percussive, nasal scatting technique that set him apart from traditional toasters. Discovered by producer Henry 'Junjo' Lawes in late 1979, he released hits like 'Wah Do Dem' (1980), 'Once a Virgin,' 'Modelling Queen,' and 'Virgin Girl,' leading to his debut album *Bubble Up Yu Hip* that year and the international smash *Wa Do Dem* in 1981. Backed by the Roots Radics and working with producers like Linval Thompson and Scientist on Greensleeves, he became the highlight of Reggae Sunsplash 1981 and 1982, with further albums like *Skidip* (1982), *Mouse and the Man* (1983), and *Mouseketeer* (1984) cementing his stardom amid dancehall's rise.[2][3][4][5]

His legacy endures as one of reggae's earliest singjays, influencing the genre with quirky, socially conscious lyrics on ghetto life, ganja, and vigilantism, delivered through vocal gymnastics dubbed 'reggae's Al Jarreau.' Touring extensively into the 2000s (200-250 shows yearly), he collaborated on modern projects and released *Eeksperience* in 2001, maintaining a high profile with his 6'6" stature and distinctive style.[3][5]
