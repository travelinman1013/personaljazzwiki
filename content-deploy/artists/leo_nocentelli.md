## Biography
Leo Nocentelli, born June 15, 1946, in New Orleans, Louisiana, is a legendary guitarist, songwriter, and founding member of the influential funk band The Meters. Raised in a musically rich environment, Nocentelli began playing ukulele as a child before switching to guitar at age twelve, inspired by jazz and the vibrant New Orleans music scene. By his early teens, he was already performing professionally, backing artists such as Otis Redding and Clyde McPhatter, and working as a session musician for Motown acts like The Supremes, The Temptations, and The Spinners.

After serving in the Army from 1964 to 1966, Nocentelli joined Art Neville and the Neville Sounds, which soon evolved into The Meters alongside George Porter Jr. and Zigaboo Modeliste. As the band's lead guitarist and principal songwriter, he penned funk classics like "Cissy Strut" and "Hey Pocky A-Way," helping to define the New Orleans funk sound. The Meters' innovative grooves influenced generations of musicians and earned them a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. Beyond The Meters, Nocentelli became a sought-after session guitarist, recording with artists such as Dr. John, Robert Palmer, Etta James, Patti LaBelle, and Jimmy Buffett.

Throughout his career, Nocentelli has remained active, performing with various Meters-inspired lineups and continuing to shape the sound of funk and R&B. His solo work, including the long-shelved album "Another Side" (recorded in 1971 and released in 2021), showcases his versatility and enduring creativity. Nocentelli's contributions have cemented his legacy as a foundational figure in American music, particularly within the genres of funk, R&B, and New Orleans jazz.
