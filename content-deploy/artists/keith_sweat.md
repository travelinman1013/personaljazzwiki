## Biography
Keith Sweat, born July 22, 1961, in Harlem, New York, is a pioneering R&B singer, songwriter, and producer whose career helped define the new jack swing era of the late 1980s and 1990s. Raised as the third of five children, Sweat faced early adversity with the loss of his father at age 12. He attended City College of New York, earning a degree in communications, and initially worked on Wall Street before fully pursuing music. Sweat began performing at 14 and was a member of the band Jamilah, touring the New York area before embarking on a solo career.

Sweat's breakthrough came with his 1987 debut album, 'Make It Last Forever,' which sold over three million copies and produced several R&B hits, including 'I Want Her.' His smooth, emotive vocal style and production helped popularize new jack swing, blending R&B with hip-hop rhythms. Subsequent albums like 'I'll Give All My Love to You' and 'Keep It Comin'' solidified his status, while collaborations with artists such as Silk and the supergroup LSG (with Gerald Levert and Johnny Gill) expanded his influence. Sweat's legacy includes not only chart-topping singles and albums but also his role in discovering and mentoring new talent, making him a central figure in contemporary R&B.[1][2][3][4][6]
