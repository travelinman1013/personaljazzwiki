# TONYA BOYD-CANNON & DA TRUTH BRASS BAND

## Biography
Tonya Boyd-Cannon, a Mississippi-born and Louisiana-raised singer-songwriter, began singing as a child, the daughter of a preacher, with much of her musical training from high school and middle school band directors through auditory learning and observation. She is a classically trained vocalist who studied vocal performance in college and plays piano, organ, drums, and saxophone, performing across genres like jazz, funk, classical, rock, gospel, reggae, and neo-soul. Her professional career launched as a background vocalist for Jean Knight, known for 'Mr. Big Stuff,' and expanded into roles as a music vocal coach, educator, creative arts teacher, minister of music, and former Orleans Parish Prison sheriff's deputy, where she created the first combined male and female mass choir.[1][2][3][4][6]

Boyd-Cannon's career gained prominence with her 2006 album *Rise My Child*, the 2010 win in Budweiser’s Battle for the Crown allowing her to open for Anthony Hamilton, KEM, and Jaheim, and appearances at festivals like Bayfest, New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, and Essence Fest, including an onstage moment with Eve. She competed on NBC's *The Voice* in 2015, delivering a standout gospel-infused rendition of Elton John's 'Take Me to the Pilot.' Her style fuses soulful contralto vocals with diverse instrumentation into a 'musical gumbo,' marked by versatility, sensuality, and bravado in New Orleans' brass band and soul scenes.[1][3][4]

Today, Boyd-Cannon serves as executive director of the 'Rise My Child' Foundation for youth aged 3-18, directs the New Orleans Citywide Youth Choir, and leads global vocal workshops, viewing music as a healer that reflects her inspirational artistry and community commitment.[1][3]
