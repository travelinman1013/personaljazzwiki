## Biography
Memphis Slim, born John Len Chatman on September 3, 1915, in Memphis, Tennessee, was a towering figure in blues music, renowned for his powerful piano playing, soulful vocals, and prolific songwriting. Raised in a musical family—his father, Peter Chatman, was a singer and pianist—Slim was largely self-taught and began performing in Memphis clubs as a teenager. By his early twenties, he had moved north as part of the Great Migration, settling in Chicago by 1939, where he quickly became a fixture in the vibrant blues scene, collaborating with major artists such as Big Bill Broonzy and Sonny Boy Williamson. 

Slim's recording career began in earnest in the early 1940s, initially under the name Peter Chatman, before adopting the stage name Memphis Slim at the suggestion of producer Lester Melrose. He became a regular session musician for Bluebird Records, backing blues luminaries and developing his own distinctive style—a synthesis of boogie-woogie, jump blues, and classic blues. His 1947 recording 'Every Day I Have the Blues' became a blues standard, covered by countless artists. Throughout the 1940s and 1950s, Slim led his own bands, including the House Rockers, and recorded prolifically, producing over 500 tracks and helping to bridge the gap between traditional and urban blues. 

In the 1960s, Slim's career took an international turn as he began touring Europe, eventually settling in Paris in 1962. There, he became a cultural ambassador for the blues, performing widely, appearing on television, and even composing film scores. His influence extended across the Atlantic, inspiring new generations of blues and rock musicians. Honored in his later years by both the French government and the U.S. Senate, Memphis Slim remained active until his death in Paris on February 24, 1988. He was posthumously inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame and the Memphis Music Hall of Fame, cementing his legacy as one of the most important figures in 20th-century blues.
