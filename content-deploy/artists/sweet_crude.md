## Biography
Sweet Crude is a vibrant indie pop and rock band formed in 2013 in New Orleans, Louisiana, distinguished by their innovative blend of English and Louisiana French lyrics[2][8]. The group’s founding members, Sam Craft and Alexis Marceaux, both grew up in families where Cajun French was still spoken, inspiring them to preserve and modernize the language through music[3]. Their desire to create a sound that honored Louisiana’s heritage led to the formation of a large ensemble, emphasizing group vocals and energetic percussion, with a mission to celebrate and sustain the Acadian region’s traditions[1][5].

The band’s early development was rooted in community and collaboration, with members coming together from various musical projects, including Glasgow and Alexis and the Samurai[1]. Sweet Crude’s debut album, 'Créatures,' released in 2017, showcased their bilingual harmonies, catchy pop choruses, and dynamic rhythms, earning them recognition in both local and international Francophone circles[2][5]. Signing with Verve Forecast in 2019, they released their major label debut 'Officiel/Artificiel' in 2020, further expanding their reach despite pandemic-related touring delays[2].

Sweet Crude’s musical style is characterized by lush harmonies, driving percussion, and a playful fusion of indie rock with traditional Cajun influences. Their legacy lies in revitalizing Louisiana French for new generations, inspiring young musicians to embrace bilingualism and cultural heritage through contemporary music[3][5].
