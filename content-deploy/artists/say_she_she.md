## Biography
Say She She is a female-led 'discodelic soul' band formed in Brooklyn, New York, fronted by Piya Malik (formerly of El Michels Affair and Chicano Batman), Sabrina Mileo Cunningham, and Nya Gazelle Brown. The trio, all classically trained singers, met serendipitously as neighbors in New York City, bonding over their shared love of harmony and retro grooves. Their name is a playful homage to Nile Rodgers and Chic, reflecting their deep roots in disco and 1970s funk, while their sound is characterized by lush three-part harmonies, infectious hooks, and a blend of punk-chic attitude and soulful rebellion.[1][2][4]

The group began writing music together after a spontaneous rooftop singing session, soon collaborating with musicians from Orgōne, The Dap-Kings, The Shacks, and Chicano Batman. Their debut album 'Prism' (2022) was met with critical acclaim, followed by 'Silver' (2023), which topped year-end lists from KCRW and earned praise from The Guardian and NPR. Their third album, 'Cut & Rewind' (2025), further expanded their sonic palette, drawing from influences as varied as Minnie Riperton, Rotary Connection, ESG, and contemporary acts like Lambrini Girls. Say She She has performed at major venues and festivals including Glastonbury, the Hollywood Bowl, and Austin City Limits, establishing themselves as a vibrant force in modern soul and disco revival.[1][4][5]

Their music is both a celebration and a call to action, blending irresistible dance rhythms with lyrics that often carry messages of empowerment and social consciousness. With their rapid ascent, international tours, and endorsements from legends like Nile Rodgers and Questlove, Say She She has become known for their innovative approach to retro soul, their dynamic live shows, and their commitment to uplifting both minds and bodies through music.[1][4][5]
