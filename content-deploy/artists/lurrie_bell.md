## Biography
Lurrie Bell was born on December 13, 1958, in Chicago, Illinois, to renowned blues harmonica player Carey Bell. He began his musical journey at age five when he picked up his father's guitar and taught himself to play, later receiving formal training from Chicago blues legends including Eddy Clearwater, Big Walter Horton, and Eddie Taylor. His early years were shaped by experiences in the American South, where he played gospel music in church with his brothers as part of a group called "The Ding Dongs," though the church discouraged blues as "devil's music." By his early teens, Bell had returned to Chicago and immersed himself in the city's vibrant blues scene, playing with boogie-woogie pianist Lovie Lee and eventually joining Willie Dixon's Chicago Blues All-Stars at age 17, where he realized his calling to dedicate his life to the blues.

Bell's early career trajectory was meteoric. At 17, he co-founded the Sons of Blues with Billy Branch and Freddie Dixon (son of Willie Dixon), and made his recording debut in 1977 on his father's album "Heartaches and Pain" and Eddie C. Campbell's "King of the Jungle." From 1978 to 1982, he toured internationally with "Queen of the Blues" Koko Taylor, gaining international recognition for his incendiary guitar playing and passionate vocals that attracted attention from Rolling Stone and the New York Times. His elegant, intense guitar style maintained the heritage of post-war Chicago blues icons like Hubert Sumlin, Buddy Guy, Otis Rush, and Eddie C. Campbell while establishing his own unique voice.

Despite his promising start, Bell faced significant personal challenges throughout the 1980s, including mental illness, drug abuse, and homelessness. He was diagnosed with schizophrenia and admitted to a psychiatric institution, but with proper medication and support, he began a remarkable comeback in 1995 with the well-received album "Mercurial Son" on the Delmark label. This marked the beginning of a prolific period that included critically acclaimed releases like "Cutting Heads" (2001) and "The Devil Ain't Got No Music" (2012), which won the Prix du Blues Award from L'Academie du Jazz. Bell has appeared on over 50 recordings as a leader or featured sideman, recorded 15 solo albums across 39 years, and earned a 2009 Grammy nomination and 2015 Blues Foundation recognition as Best Traditional Male Blues Artist. His resilience, technical mastery, and authentic connection to Chicago blues tradition have solidified his legacy as one of the leading lights in contemporary blues.
