## Biography
Jello Biafra & Mojo Nixon is not a standing band but the high-profile collaboration between two already-iconic American underground figures: **Jello Biafra** (Eric Reed Boucher), frontman of seminal political punk band Dead Kennedys and co‑founder of the Alternative Tentacles label, and **Mojo Nixon** (Neill Kirby McMillan Jr.), a wild, irreverent psychobilly/roots-rock singer best known for satirical cult songs like “Elvis Is Everywhere.”[1][4] Both came out of late‑1970s/early‑1980s U.S. punk and underground scenes—Biafra from Colorado and then San Francisco’s punk milieu, Nixon from North Carolina via the San Diego roots/punk bar circuit—and each built reputations as sharp, humorous social critics before joining forces.[1][3][4]

Their primary joint statement is the 1994 album *Prairie Home Invasion*, recorded in Austin, Texas with Nixon’s backing band the Toadliquors and released on Alternative Tentacles.[1][2] Conceived at a time when Biafra felt punk had become “retro, commercialized, and just plain boring,” the project deliberately dove into **authentic roots, country, and hillbilly music** as a more radical vehicle for protest songs, populist satire, and left‑wing commentary.[2] The record blends Biafra’s biting political lyrics and quivering vocal delivery with Nixon’s boisterous bar‑band energy and a twangy, barroom-country sound, creating a one‑off hybrid that critiques right‑wing politics, corporate media, and cultural complacency through humor and Americana forms.[1][2]

Although *Prairie Home Invasion* remains their only full studio album as a duo, its cult status sits at the crossroads of 1980s hardcore punk, 1990s alt‑country, and satirical protest music. It reinforced Biafra’s post‑Dead Kennedys evolution into a multi‑genre agitator and broadened Nixon’s association with politically charged material beyond pure novelty rock.[1][2][4] Over time, the record has been cited by fans and commentators as an example of how punk’s anti‑authoritarian spirit can migrate into roots and country idioms without losing its confrontational edge, and it is frequently mentioned in overviews of both artists’ careers as a distinctive and unexpected highlight.[1][2]

## Fun Facts
- Prairie Home Invasion was recorded in Austin, Texas, and described by Jello Biafra’s own booking/biographical notes as an 'authentic roots and country album'—a deliberate reaction against what he saw as punk’s slide into retro commercialism in the early 1990s.[2]
- The collaboration was released on Alternative Tentacles, the independent label Jello Biafra co‑founded in 1979 for Dead Kennedys, underscoring how he used his own DIY infrastructure to support stylistically unexpected projects like this country‑leaning record.[3][4]
- Although often remembered as a punk frontman, Biafra had long admired American roots traditions; Prairie Home Invasion let him channel influences associated with figures such as Woody Guthrie into a satirical, hillbilly‑styled protest record with Mojo Nixon.[2][6]
- Mojo Nixon and Jello Biafra remained close friends for decades after the album; following Nixon’s death, Biafra wrote a lengthy remembrance calling him a 'real gentleman' and 'cult hero,' showing that their partnership extended well beyond a single studio project.[1][6]

- [[woody_guthrie|Woody Guthrie]] - Jello Biafra, writing about Nixon after his death, called him a 'true son of Woody Guthrie,' underscoring Guthrie’s model of populist, anti‑authoritarian folk protest as a key template for the roots‑and‑country protest approach of Prairie Home Invasion.
