## Biography
Emmylou Harris and Rodney Crowell are two of the most influential figures in country rock and Americana, whose partnership spans decades of musical evolution. Harris, born in Birmingham, Alabama in 1947, began her career in the folk scene before being discovered by Gram Parsons, who guided her toward a country rock sound that would define her career. Her crystalline vocals and interpretive skill quickly set her apart, leading to a string of acclaimed albums in the 1970s and 1980s, and cementing her as a bridge between country and rock audiences. Crowell, born in Houston, Texas in 1950, emerged as a gifted songwriter and performer in the vibrant 1970s Los Angeles country-rock scene. He joined Harris’s Hot Band as a rhythm guitarist and harmony singer, contributing to her sound while developing his own solo career as a respected songwriter and artist.

The pair first crossed paths in the mid-1970s, when Harris recruited Crowell for her band and began recording his songs. Their musical chemistry was immediate, marked by Harris’s pure, emotive voice and Crowell’s warm, rootsy delivery. Despite their long friendship and frequent collaborations, it was not until 2013 that they released their first full duet album, 'Old Yellow Moon,' which won a Grammy and was followed by 'The Traveling Kind' in 2015. Their work together is celebrated for its blend of classic country, rockabilly, and Americana, with harmonies and songwriting that evoke both nostalgia and innovation. Both artists are lauded for their integrity, versatility, and enduring influence on American roots music.
