## Biography
Lil' Bob and the Lollipops was a prominent R&B and swamp pop band led by Camille Bob, also known as Lil' Bob or Little Bob. Born on November 7, 1937, in Arnaudville, Louisiana, Camille Bob grew up in rural Prairie Laurent, where he developed an early passion for music while working on a farm. Inspired by the sounds of B.B. King and other blues legends, Bob began performing as a singing drummer and soon formed his own group, The Lollipops, in the mid-1950s.

The band first recorded for Goldband Records in Lake Charles in 1957 and quickly became a staple of the Louisiana music scene, blending rhythm and blues with the distinctive swamp pop style of the region. Their energetic performances and soulful sound made them favorites at local dance halls and clubs, and their hit "I Got Loaded" became an enduring classic. Over a career spanning more than 50 years, Lil' Bob and the Lollipops entertained generations of fans and left a lasting mark on the musical landscape of Southwest Louisiana.

Although the group never achieved mainstream national fame, their influence on regional music was profound. Camille Bob's leadership and musical vision helped define the sound of Louisiana R&B and swamp pop, and his legacy continues to inspire musicians in the genres of Cajun, zydeco, and beyond.
