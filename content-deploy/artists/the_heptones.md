## Biography
The Heptones, a legendary Jamaican rocksteady and reggae vocal trio, formed in 1965 in Kingston by Earl Morgan, Barry Llewellyn (also known as Barrington Llewellyn), and Leroy Sibbles, initially as 'The Hep Ones' before adopting their name inspired by a Heptones Tonic bottle. Hailing from Trench Town, a musically vibrant area near key studios like Studio One and Treasure Isle, the group drew influences from American soul acts like the Impressions and Temptations, developing a mellow, harmony-driven style that bridged ska, rocksteady, and reggae. They debuted with hits like 'Fattie Fattie' in 1966 for Coxsone Dodd's Studio One, followed by successes such as 'Pretty Looks Isn't All,' 'Ting a Ling,' and 'Party Time,' establishing them as rivals to The Techniques and contemporaries of The Wailers and The Maytals.[1][2][3]

During their five-year tenure at Studio One, Leroy Sibbles not only sang but played bass on seminal tracks, arranged sessions alongside Jackie Mittoo, and contributed to instrumental releases by the Soul Vendors and Sound Dimension, including rhythms for Alton Ellis' 'I'm Still in Love' and The Abyssinians' 'Satta Massagana.' Transitioning into reggae, they scored with 'Book of Rules' (1973, led by Llewellyn) and covers like 'Suspicious Minds,' then recorded for producers like Joe Gibbs and Harry J. Signing with Island Records in 1975 yielded albums *Night Food* (1976) and *Party Time* (1977), supported by tours with Toots & The Maytals, though lineup changes followed as Sibbles departed and Naggo Morris joined.[1][2]

By the late 1970s, shifting audience tastes toward roots reggae diminished their prominence, but the original trio reunited in 1995 for *Pressure!*, and later lineups including Morgan, Robert Dacres, and Carlton Scarlett released *Rebel Love* in 2016. Barry Llewellyn passed away in 2011 at age 64. Their three-part harmonies and measured tempos profoundly shaped rocksteady and early reggae.[1][2][3]

## Fun Facts
- The group named themselves 'The Heptones' after Earl Morgan spotted a Heptones Tonic bottle in a pile of refuse.
- Their debut Studio One hit 'Fattie Fattie' (1966) was controversial for its sexually suggestive lyrics but marked the shift to slower rocksteady tempos.
- Leroy Sibbles auditioned acts, played bass on classics like Alton Ellis' 'I'm Still in Love,' and co-arranged with Jackie Mittoo at Studio One.
- The original members lived together or as next-door neighbors for years, moving as a tight-knit unit across Kingston neighborhoods.
