## Biography
Jelly Roll Morton, born Ferdinand Joseph LaMothe (also spelled Lemott or La Menthe) around October 20, 1890, in New Orleans, Louisiana, was a pivotal figure in the early development of jazz. Raised in a Creole family, Morton showed musical talent from a young age, mastering the piano by age ten and absorbing the diverse musical influences of New Orleans, including ragtime, blues, and Creole traditions. Despite his family's disapproval, he began performing professionally in the bordellos of Storyville by 1902, quickly gaining a reputation as a skilled pianist, composer, and entertainer. His travels across the United States exposed him to a wide range of musical styles, which he synthesized into his own distinctive approach.

Morton's career flourished in the 1920s, especially after his move to Chicago, where he recorded some of the era's most influential jazz compositions, such as "Jelly Roll Blues"—one of the first published jazz pieces—"King Porter Stomp," and "Black Bottom Stomp." He led the Red Hot Peppers, a studio band whose recordings from 1926 to 1930 are considered jazz classics. Morton was not only a virtuoso pianist but also jazz's first important arranger, demonstrating that jazz could retain its improvisational spirit even when notated and structured. His music often featured the "Spanish Tinge," a rhythmic element inspired by Caribbean music, and his arrangements balanced written parts with space for improvisation.

Though his fame waned during the Great Depression and the rise of new jazz innovators, Morton's influence endured. He was posthumously recognized as a foundational architect of jazz, with his life and music celebrated in Broadway musicals, recordings, and his 1998 induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. His extensive Library of Congress interviews remain a vital resource for understanding the origins of jazz and Morton's own colorful, sometimes controversial, legacy.

## Fun Facts
- Morton claimed to have 'invented jazz' in 1902, a boast widely debated but reflective of his confidence and impact.

- Morton supplemented his income as a pool hustler and card shark while traveling the South as a musician.
- His 1938 Library of Congress interviews with Alan Lomax are among the most extensive oral histories of early jazz, featuring Morton playing, singing, and recounting stories from his career.
