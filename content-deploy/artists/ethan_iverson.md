## Biography
Ethan Iverson is a pianist, composer, and writer born in Menomonie, Wisconsin, who first came to international prominence as a founding member of The Bad Plus, a game-changing jazz collective formed in 2001 with bassist Reid Anderson and drummer David King.[1][2] The New York Times called The Bad Plus "Better than anyone at melding the sensibilities of post-'60s jazz and indie rock."[1] During his 17-year tenure with the group, The Bad Plus performed in prestigious venues including the Village Vanguard, Carnegie Hall, and Bonnaroo, while collaborating with notable artists such as Joshua Redman, Bill Frisell, and the Mark Morris Dance Group.[1][2] The ensemble created a faithful arrangement of Igor Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring and a radical reinvention of Ornette Coleman's Science Fiction.[1]

Before The Bad Plus achieved prominence, Iverson moved to New York in 1991 to study jazz at New York University, where he was exposed to contemporary classical music through instructors and mentors.[3] He worked extensively as a rehearsal pianist and musical director for the Mark Morris Dance Group beginning around 1995, a position that provided crucial income and artistic development while he pursued his jazz career.[3] This dual engagement with both jazz and classical traditions became central to his artistic identity. Since leaving The Bad Plus, Iverson has maintained a prolific career as a solo artist, releasing albums including Common Practice with Tom Harrell on ECM (2019), Bud Powell in the 21st Century (2021), and Every Note is True on Blue Note Records (2022).[2] He joined New England Conservatory's jazz studio faculty in 2016 and has become recognized as a thoughtful interpreter of jazz tradition and a passionate advocate for neglected corners of the musical canon.[4]

Iverson is also known as a writer and critic, maintaining the influential blog "Do the Math" for over a decade, which features musician-to-musician interviews and analysis.[4] Time Out New York selected him as one of 25 essential New York jazz icons, describing him as "Perhaps NYC's most thoughtful and passionate student of jazz tradition—the most admirable sort of artist-scholar."[4] His work spans composition, arrangement, performance, and scholarship, consistently celebrating both the rich tradition and continuous evolution of jazz.[6]

## Fun Facts
- Iverson had an early encounter with legendary conductor Robert Craft while working as rehearsal pianist for the Gregg Smith Singers. During the first rehearsal of Stravinsky's Mass, Iverson successfully executed a difficult exposed slow quintuplet on the first try, prompting Craft to mutter approvingly, "Not bad."[3]
- While working for the Mark Morris Dance Group, Iverson discovered that the Baroque opera Rameau's Plateé was recorded at a lower tuning (A-flat instead of A=440), which was his first professional encounter with historical performance practice.[3]
- Iverson did not have a piano teacher during his early years and was largely self-taught, learning by sight-reading and studying composers like Bach, Beethoven, Mozart, and 20th-century composers including Bartók and Schoenberg.[3]
- He only lasted two years at New York University (1991-1993) before leaving to pursue his jazz career, yet went on to become a faculty member at New England Conservatory's jazz studio in 2016.[8]
