## Biography
Linton Kwesi Johnson, born on August 24, 1952, in Chapelton, Clarendon, Jamaica, is a pioneering dub poet, musician, and political activist. He moved to London in 1963, joining his mother as part of the Windrush generation, and attended Tulse Hill secondary school before studying Sociology at Goldsmiths' College, University of London. Johnson became involved in the British Black Panther Movement as a teenager, organizing poetry workshops and performing with the Rasta Love group, which fused poetry and drumming as a form of cultural resistance.

Johnson began publishing poetry in the early 1970s, with his first collection, 'Voices of the Living and the Dead,' released in 1974. He is best known for blending his politically charged verse, often recited in Jamaican patois, with dub and reggae rhythms—a style that became known as dub poetry. His debut album, 'Dread Beat an’ Blood' (1978), and subsequent works like 'Forces of Victory' (1979) and 'Bass Culture' (1980), addressed themes of racism, police brutality, and social injustice in Britain. Johnson's collaborations with producer Dennis Bovell and the Dub Band were central to his sound, and his influence extended into journalism, radio, and activism throughout the 1980s and beyond.

Regarded as the world's first reggae poet, Johnson's impact on British poetry, reggae, and political discourse is profound. In 2002, he became the first black poet and only the second living poet to be published in Penguin’s Modern Classics series. His work has been translated into multiple languages, and he remains a respected figure in both literary and musical circles, recognized for using poetry as a weapon in the struggle against racial oppression.
