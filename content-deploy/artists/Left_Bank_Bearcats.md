## Biography
The Left Bank Bearcats were a studio jazz ensemble active in the late 1950s and early 1960s, primarily known for their Dixieland recordings. The group was assembled by producers working for budget labels such as Somerset, with the intention of capitalizing on the popularity of Dixieland jazz and the commercial success of bands like the Dukes of Dixieland. The musicians were largely anonymous, with some records using pseudonyms; for example, trumpeter Joe Techer was credited as 'Aron Dubois' on several albums[2][4].

The Bearcats recorded a series of albums that featured energetic renditions of Dixieland standards and American popular songs, including themed releases such as 'The Left Bank Bearcats Take George M. Cohan to Dixieland.' Their musical style was characterized by lively ensemble playing, strong rhythmic drive, and a repertoire that blended New Orleans jazz with popular tunes of the era[5]. While not a touring or performing band, their studio output contributed to the mid-century jazz revival and made Dixieland accessible to a wider audience through affordable records sold in department stores and supermarkets[4].

Though the Left Bank Bearcats themselves did not achieve lasting fame, their recordings are representative of the era's studio jazz projects. The group’s legacy lies in their role as part of the wave of budget-label jazz releases that helped keep traditional jazz styles in circulation during a period of changing musical tastes. Their albums remain of interest to collectors and jazz historians as examples of the commercial strategies and musical trends of the time[4][5].
