## Biography
Novos Baianos (often billed as Os Novos Baianos) are a pioneering Brazilian group formed in the late 1960s in Salvador, Bahia, emerging from the vibrant MPB and tropicalista-influenced scene of the era.[1][4] The core early lineup coalesced around vocalist Paulinho Boca de Cantor, singer‑guitarist Moraes Moreira, singer Baby Consuelo (now Baby do Brasil), and lyricist Luiz Galvão, later expanding to include guitarist Pepeu Gomes, his drummer brother Jorginho Gomes, bassist Dadi, and others.[1][3][4] They debuted publicly with the stage show “Desembarque dos Bichos Depois do Dilúvio Universal” in 1968 and gained national visibility at the V Festival de Música Popular Brasileira on TV Record in 1969, leading to their first album, “É Ferro na Boneca,” which initially leaned more toward psychedelic rock and pop.[1] 

In the early 1970s the group moved from Bahia to Rio de Janeiro, first sharing a penthouse apartment in Botafogo and later establishing a communal household on a farm (sítio) in Jacarepaguá, where as many as dozens of people lived together in a free‑spirited, hippie‑inflected environment during Brazil’s military dictatorship.[1][3][4] Around 1971–72, close contact with bossa nova innovator João Gilberto decisively reshaped their sound, steering them from rock toward an intricate fusion of samba, choro, frevo, bossa nova, rock, and other Brazilian popular and folkloric forms, centered on sophisticated acoustic guitar work and poly‑rhythmic interplay.[1][3] This transformation culminated in their landmark 1972 album “Acabou Chorare,” widely regarded as one of the greatest Brazilian albums of all time for its inventive blend of electric and acoustic textures, playful yet politically resonant lyrics, and communal energy.[1][2][4] Subsequent releases, including “Novos Baianos F.C.” (famously recorded under rustic conditions in a garage in Vargem Grande, Rio de Janeiro), reinforced their reputation as innovators who married experimental arrangements to deeply Brazilian grooves.[2][3]

By the mid‑ to late 1970s, individual ambitions and changing personal circumstances gradually pulled the collective apart, and Novos Baianos officially disbanded around 1978, with most members pursuing successful solo careers—Baby and Pepeu, in particular, becoming prominent pop‑rock figures of the 1980s.[1][3][5] Despite the breakup, their catalog continued to grow in stature, and “Acabou Chorare” in particular became a touchstone for subsequent generations of Brazilian artists exploring hybrid forms of MPB, rock, and samba.[1][2][4] The band reunited periodically for special performances and recordings, including a high‑profile reunion tour and live album/DVD “Novos Baianos Se Encontram” in the mid‑2010s, which earned major Brazilian music awards and introduced their work to new audiences.[3][4][5] Today, Novos Baianos are celebrated not only for their musical innovations but also for their communal, countercultural lifestyle, which symbolized creative resistance and freedom under authoritarian rule and helped cement their legacy as one of Brazil’s most influential and beloved groups of the 1970s.[1][3][4][7]

## Fun Facts
- The group’s famous communal apartment in Botafogo, Rio de Janeiro, became notorious not only for music but for wild indoor football (soccer) matches—band members recall playing games inside the apartment as a central part of their daily life.
- Novos Baianos later formed an actual football team, Novos Baianos Futebol Clube, playing organized matches that sometimes featured celebrity ringers like Chico Buarque; some members joked that football occasionally took precedence over music.
- Their third album, “Novos Baianos F.C.,” was recorded in a makeshift garage studio in Vargem Grande on the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro, reflecting both their bohemian lifestyle and DIY approach to production.
- After the group dissolved, Baby Consuelo and guitarist Pepeu Gomes married, had six children, and both became major Brazilian rock/pop stars in the 1980s, while remaining closely associated in the public imagination with the Novos Baianos legacy.

## Musical Connections

### Mentors/Influences
- [[joão_gilberto|João Gilberto]] - Bossa nova pioneer who spent time living and playing with Novos Baianos in Rio, profoundly reshaping their musical direction from psychedelic rock toward MPB and acoustic samba‑choro sophistication. (Influence most evident on the album “Acabou Chorare,” whose arrangements and guitar language reflect his aesthetic.) [c. 1971–1972]
- [[tom_zé|Tom Zé]] - Tropicalista composer who effectively ‘lit the fire’ of the group by recommending singer‑guitarist Moraes Moreira to lyricist Luiz Galvão, catalyzing the core creative partnership that became Novos Baianos. (Early pre‑debut collaborations and the formative period leading to “É Ferro na Boneca.”) [c. 1967–1968]
- [[gilberto_gil_and_caetano_veloso|Gilberto Gil and Caetano Veloso]] - Leading figures of Tropicália whose boundary‑pushing fusion of Brazilian traditions with rock and global pop provided a stylistic and ideological framework that Novos Baianos absorbed, particularly around the Barra 69 show where they shared the bill. (Indirect influence visible in Novos Baianos’ early rock‑MPB hybrid on “É Ferro na Boneca” and their live collaborations around Barra 69.) [late 1960s–early 1970s]

### Key Collaborators
- [[paulinho_boca_de_cantor|Paulinho Boca de Cantor]] - Founding vocalist and central member of Novos Baianos, contributing lead vocals, pandeiro, and songwriting across the classic 1970s recordings. (“É Ferro na Boneca,” “Acabou Chorare,” “Novos Baianos F.C.” and subsequent 1970s albums, plus later reunion shows.) [late 1960s–1978; reunions from 1990s onward]
- [[moraes_moreira|Moraes Moreira]] - Founding singer, guitarist, and principal composer whose melodies and harmonic language were crucial to the band’s signature sound. (Key role on “É Ferro na Boneca,” “Acabou Chorare,” “Novos Baianos F.C.” and other 1970s releases before departing for a solo career.) [c. 1967–1976/78; later reunion appearances]
- [[baby_consuelo_baby_do_brasil|Baby Consuelo (Baby do Brasil)]] - Charismatic vocalist and percussionist whose distinctive voice and stage presence were central to the group’s identity, later a major solo pop‑rock artist. (Featured on “Acabou Chorare,” “Novos Baianos F.C.” and other core albums; later co‑led reunion project “Novos Baianos Se Encontram.”) [late 1960s–1978; reunions in 1990s and 2010s]
- [[luiz_galvão|Luiz Galvão]] - Founding lyricist, conceptual ‘mentor,’ and creative director who initiated the group and wrote many of its lyrics, also authoring a later book on the band’s 1970s era. (Lyrics across the catalog, including songs on “Acabou Chorare” and “Novos Baianos F.C.”; book “Anos 70: Novos e Baianos.”) [c. 1967–1978; later historical and reunion involvement]
- [[pepeu_gomes|Pepeu Gomes]] - Virtuoso guitarist (and later multi‑instrumentalist) who brought psychedelic‑rock technique and Hendrix‑influenced electric guitar to the band, then evolved into a key arranger in their fusion of rock, samba, and choro. (Prominent on “É Ferro na Boneca,” “Acabou Chorare,” “Novos Baianos F.C.” and later 1970s albums; co‑leader on reunion shows and the live release “Novos Baianos Se Encontram.”) [from 1969 integration via Os Leifs through 1978; reunions from 2010s]
- [[dadi_arnaldo_brandãodadi_carvalho__commonly_known_as_dadi|Dadi (Arnaldo Brandão/Dadi Carvalho – commonly known as Dadi)]] - Bassist who anchored the group’s rhythmic and harmonic foundation before leaving to work with other major Brazilian artists such as Jorge Ben. (Played on early‑ to mid‑1970s Novos Baianos albums; later appears on Jorge Ben’s “África Brasil.”) [early 1970s–mid‑1970s with Novos Baianos]
- [[jorginho_gomes|Jorginho Gomes]] - Drummer from Os Leifs who joined Novos Baianos, helping define the group’s groove and contributing to their rock‑samba fusion. (Key participant on “Acabou Chorare,” “Novos Baianos F.C.” and succeeding studio albums.) [from c. 1969 through the 1970s]
- [[pedro_baby|Pedro Baby]] - Guitarist and musical director, son of Baby do Brasil and Pepeu Gomes, who coordinated and led the group’s major mid‑2010s reunion tour and live recording. (Live CD/DVD “Novos Baianos Se Encontram,” which won Brazilian music awards for Best Rock/Pop Act and Album of the Year.) [c. 2015–2017 reunion cycle]

### Artists Influenced
- [[jorge_bens_band_members_via_dadi_and_1970s_mpbsambarock_scene|Jorge Ben’s band members (via Dadi) and 1970s MPB/samba‑rock scene]] - Bassist Dadi’s move from Novos Baianos to Jorge Ben’s group helped transmit the Baianos’ communal, groove‑oriented fusion into Ben’s influential mid‑1970s work, reinforcing cross‑fertilization between samba‑rock, MPB, and funk. (Jorge Ben’s album “África Brasil” (1975), where Dadi appears, is often cited as a landmark of Brazilian funk/samba‑rock that resonates with the experimental spirit Novos Baianos embodied.) [mid‑1970s]
- [[later_brazilian_mpb_and_indie_artists_various_e.g._contemporary_fusion_bands|Later Brazilian MPB and indie artists (various, e.g., contemporary fusion bands)]] - Critics and scholars note that Novos Baianos’ mixture of rock, samba, choro, and communal ethos became a model for later artists who blended traditional Brazilian genres with global pop and rock, especially within the post‑Tropicália MPB and modern independent scenes. (Subsequent homages and reinterpretations of “Acabou Chorare” and “Novos Baianos F.C.” in live tributes and recorded covers underscore their canonical status.) [1980s–present]
