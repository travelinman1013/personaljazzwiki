## Biography
Ben Williams is a Washington D.C.-born jazz bassist who has emerged as one of the most acclaimed and versatile musicians in modern jazz. A native Washingtonian, Williams graduated from the Duke Ellington School of the Arts (DESA) in 2002, where he honed his jazz skills under the tutelage of Davey Yarborough. As a teenager, he was already performing alongside D.C. jazz heavyweights like Allyn Johnson, Nasar Abadey, and Benito Gonzalez. He later studied with bassist Rodney Whitaker while attending Michigan State University, before earning his Master's in Jazz Studies from Juilliard.

Williams' rise to international prominence began in 2009 when he won the prestigious Thelonious Monk International Jazz Competition in the double bass category, which earned him a recording contract with Concord Records and $20,000 in scholarship funds. His debut album 'State of the Art' (2011) received a 4½ star review in DownBeat magazine and reached #1 on iTunes and Billboard charts, with iTunes naming him 'breakthrough artist of the year' in jazz. In 2013, he won a Grammy Award for Best Jazz Instrumental Album as a member of Pat Metheny's Unity Band, and has been recognized as 'Rising Star Bassist' in DownBeat's Critics Poll in 2013 and 2015.

Throughout his career, Williams has evolved from a straight-ahead jazz bassist to a multifaceted artist incorporating R&B, hip-hop, and gospel influences. His 2020 album 'I Am a Man' marked his debut as a vocalist and showcased his growth as a socio-political artist, earning him recognition as 'Rising Star Vocalist' in DownBeat's 2022 Critics' Poll. Currently based in Los Angeles after spending 15 years in New York, Williams continues to push musical boundaries through projects like Butterfly Black (a duo with singer Syndee Winters) and his latest work 'Between Church & State,' which explores his family roots in the South.
