## Biography
Shane Theriot (pronounced 'terry-oh') was born on October 3, 1972, in Thibodaux, Louisiana, a small town approximately 60 miles from New Orleans.[2] Exposed to music from an early age, he began playing drums and guitar at age 11, and also studied trumpet and piano during his formative years.[2] His early musical education was largely self-taught, supplemented by private study in classical and jazz guitar during high school.[2] At age 12, he performed at the 1984 Louisiana World Exposition, demonstrating his precocious talent.[2] Following high school, Theriot attended the Guitar Institute of Technology (now Musicians Institute) in Los Angeles, where guitarist Scott Henderson—an instructor and member of Tribal Tech and Chick Corea's band—recommended him for a teaching position at age 20.[1][2]

Theriot's professional career gained momentum in the 1990s when he began working as a session guitarist and recording his own music.[2] In 1996, he joined The Neville Brothers, with whom he performed until 2003, touring nationally and internationally while simultaneously working on solo projects with Art Neville and Aaron Neville.[2] His versatility across multiple genres—funk, jazz, blues, and rock—led to extensive collaborations with artists including Willie Nelson, Boz Scaggs, Little Feat, Jon Cleary, and Rickie Lee Jones.[1][2] As a composer, his original compositions have been featured on ESPN, MTV, VH1, HBO, Food Network, NCIS, and Showtime Networks.[1][2] In 2015, Theriot achieved Grammy recognition as a producer for Jo-El Sonnier's album 'The Legacy.'[1] Since 2020, he has served as musical director and guitarist for Hall & Oates' touring band and as musical director and guitarist for the television show 'Live from Daryl's House.'[2]

Theriot's musical style is characterized by a distinctive blend of Louisiana funk, jazz sophistication, and blues sensibility, earning him recognition as a master of New Orleans groove traditions.[1][2] He has released four solo albums as a leader: Highway 90 (2000), The Grease Factor (2003), Dirty Power (2009), and Still Motion (2017), each featuring world-class musicians and showcasing his compositional prowess.[1][2] Beyond performance, Theriot has established himself as an educator and author, having taught guitar at the Atlanta Institute of Music from 1991 to 1993, written instructional columns for Guitar Player Magazine, authored instructional books and DVDs including 'New Orleans Funk Guitar Styles' and 'Rhythm Mojo,' and been featured in Guitar Player, Guitar World, DownBeat, Rolling Stone, and Vintage Guitar magazines.[1][2] In fall 2024, he was inducted into the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame, a recognition reflecting his profound influence on contemporary music and his role in preserving and advancing Louisiana's rich musical heritage.[2]
