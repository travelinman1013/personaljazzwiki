## Biography
Joe Logan Diffie was born on December 28, 1958, in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and became one of country music's most prolific hitmakers of the 1990s. Before achieving stardom, Diffie worked as an iron foundry worker and later at the Gibson Guitar Nashville factory while pursuing his passion for songwriting and music. He initially gained recognition as a demo singer and songwriter in the mid-1980s, with his compositions recorded by artists including Charley Pride, Conway Twitty, and Tracy Lawrence. His breakthrough came in 1989 when his song "There Goes My Heart" became a number-four hit for Holly Dunn, leading to his signing with Epic Records in 1990.

Diffie's recording career spanned from 1990 to 2004, during which he charted 35 singles on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart, with five reaching number one: "Home" (his debut single), "If the Devil Danced (In Empty Pockets)," "Third Rock from the Sun," "Pickup Man" (which spent four weeks at number one), and "Bigger Than the Beatles." He became known for his versatility, delivering both sensitive traditional country ballads and novelty hits that resonated with blue-collar audiences. His 1992 album "Regular Joe" and subsequent releases like "Honky Tonk Attitude" established him as a consistent commercial force, though he remained a "middling act" who never achieved superstar status despite his prolific output and extensive touring.

Beyond his solo career, Diffie was recognized as a master craftsman of country lyrics and earned respect as a "singer's singer." He became a member of the Grand Ole Opry in 1993 and collaborated with notable artists including Mary Chapin Carpenter, George Jones, and Marty Stuart. His contributions to country music extended through the 2000s with live albums and re-recordings of his classics. Diffie passed away on March 29, 2020, at age 61.

## Fun Facts
- Diffie was the first country music artist to have a number-one debut single on all three major country music charts (Billboard Hot Country Songs, Radio & Records, and Gavin Report), and the first to have a debut single spend more than one week at number one on the latter two publications.
- Before his music career took off, Diffie experienced significant personal hardship: the foundry where he worked closed in 1986, forcing him to declare bankruptcy and sell his recording studio. His wife left him, taking their two children, leading to a period of depression before he decided to pursue music full-time in Nashville.
- Diffie's novelty hits became signature parts of his career, with songs like "Prop Me Up Beside the Jukebox (If I Die)" and "John Deere Green" becoming huge top-five hits that showcased his ability to connect with working-class country audiences.
- In his later years, Diffie returned to his musical roots by releasing "Homecoming: The Bluegrass Album" in 2010, which featured guest appearances by bluegrass musicians including The Grascals and Rhonda Vincent, demonstrating his versatility across country subgenres.
