## Biography
Jazzmeia Horn is an American jazz vocalist, composer, and bandleader known for her virtuosic improvisation, deep grounding in jazz tradition, and outspoken social consciousness. Born in 1991 in Dallas, Texas, she grew up in a close-knit, churchgoing family of singers and musicians and began singing as a toddler, joining her grandfather’s church choir around age three.[2][4] Her jazz-loving, piano‑playing grandmother chose the name “Jazzmeia,” foreshadowing a career that would link gospel roots with classic jazz language.[4] Horn attended Dallas’s Booker T. Washington High School for the Performing and Visual Arts—an incubator for artists like Roy Hargrove, Norah Jones, and Erykah Badu—before moving to New York City in 2009 to study at The New School for Jazz and Contemporary Music.[2][4] There she immersed herself in intensive training, formed early working groups, and began appearing on the New York club circuit and major jazz festivals.[1][4]

Horn’s career accelerated rapidly through a series of major competition wins: she received DownBeat Student Music Awards in 2008–2010, won the Sarah Vaughan International Jazz Vocal Competition in 2013 (after a Rising Star award in 2012), and took first prize in the prestigious Thelonious Monk Institute International Jazz Competition in 2015.[1][3][4] These successes led to a recording contract with Concord Jazz and the release of her debut album, **A Social Call**, in 2017, a project blending standards, spirituals, and soul repertoire with pointed social commentary that topped JazzWeek’s 2017 chart and earned a Grammy nomination for Best Jazz Vocal Album.[1][3][4] Her 2019 follow‑up, **Love and Liberation**, showcased a growing emphasis on original compositions and bandleading and brought a second Grammy nomination in the same category, while she continued extensive touring across the U.S., Europe, Africa, and Asia.[1][3][6] Horn’s vocal style draws frequent comparison to Betty Carter, Sarah Vaughan, and Nancy Wilson for its wide range, agile scatting, and rhythmic daring, yet she has forged a distinct voice that fuses straight‑ahead jazz, gospel inflection, African diasporic consciousness, and messages of love, self‑determination, and social change.[1][2][4] Beyond performance, she has worked as an educator, including teaching in Newark-based youth jazz programs, and published the book *Strive From Within: The Jazzmeia Horn Approach*, further cementing her role as a modern torchbearer of the jazz vocal tradition.[3][7]
