## Biography
Nobuko JoAnne Miyamoto (born November 14, 1939) is a third‑generation Japanese American singer, songwriter, dancer, theater artist, and activist whose work has been central to the Asian American Movement.[1][3][8] Born in Los Angeles, California, she and her family were among the approximately 120,000 Japanese Americans incarcerated during World War II, an experience that later became a core theme of her music and writing.[1][5] After the war she trained as a dancer and, under the name Joanne Miya, appeared in major film and stage productions, including the 1956 film version of *The King and I* and the 1961 film *West Side Story*, where she played Francisca and appeared in all of the Sharks’ musical numbers.[1][3] She also performed in the Broadway production of *Flower Drum Song*, an experience that sharpened her critique of Orientalist stereotypes and pushed her toward more explicitly political art.[4]

In the late 1960s Miyamoto’s artistic path merged with activism as she became involved in anti–Vietnam War organizing and aligned with the Black Panther Party and other movements for racial and social justice.[1][3][6] During the early Asian American Movement, she began writing songs that reflected Asian American histories and struggles, famously co‑creating with Chris Iijima the song “We Are the Children” around 1970, which became an unofficial anthem for a new political identity.[3][4] With Iijima and Charlie Chin she formed the group Yellow Pearl and in 1973 released *A Grain of Sand: Music for the Struggle by Asians in America*, often cited as the first Asian American album.[1][3][7] The record addressed Asian American identity alongside Black liberation and Indigenous land rights, signaling Miyamoto’s commitment to cross‑racial solidarity.[1] In the late 1970s she briefly joined the band Warriors of the Rainbow and in 1978 founded Great Leap, a Buddhist‑inspired, multicultural, community‑based performing arts organization in Los Angeles devoted to storytelling, music, and dance as tools for social change.[1][2][4]

Across subsequent decades Miyamoto expanded her practice to large community projects and intercultural collaborations, including the creation of FandangObon, a Los Angeles festival that brings together Japanese Obon, Mexican fandango, and African American traditions in partnership with Chicano musician Quetzal Flores.[1][4] Her later work includes deep engagement with environmental justice, urban farming through the Boggs Center fellowship in Detroit, and ongoing projects that address climate change, Asian American experiences, and Black Lives Matter.[1][4] In 2021 she released *120,000 Stories* on Smithsonian Folkways, an album titled for the number of Japanese Americans incarcerated during World War II and reflecting on memory, displacement, and solidarity.[1][5] Miyamoto also authored the memoir *Not Yo’ Butterfly: My Long Song of Relocation, Race, Love, and Revolution*, further cementing her legacy as a pioneering Asian American artist‑organizer whose work helped give Asian Americans “our own song” and continues to inspire community‑based arts activism.[4][5][6]
