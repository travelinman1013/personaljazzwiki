## Biography
Shabaka (full name **Shabaka Hutchings**) is a London-born, Barbados-raised multi-instrumentalist best known as a leading figure in contemporary British jazz and improvised music.[1][3][5] Born in 1984 to Barbadian parents, he spent much of his childhood in Barbados after early years in London and Birmingham, beginning clarinet studies around age nine while playing in school and calypso bands, and practicing classical repertoire alongside hip-hop by artists like Nas and local Barbadian music.[1][3][4][7] He took up saxophone in his early teens and, after returning to Birmingham at 16, discovered jazz in earnest through big band music and public library recordings before earning a place at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London, where he formally studied clarinet from 2004–2008.[1][3][4]

Following conservatory training, Shabaka immersed himself in London’s improvising community and a wide range of professional work, performing everything from Bollywood festivals and film scores to traditional jazz and wedding bands.[1][4] He recorded and/or toured with artists such as Mulatu Astatke and the Heliocentrics, Soweto Kinch, Floating Points, and Courtney Pine, while also playing with the London Improvisers Orchestra, before focusing his energy on three primary ensembles: **Sons of Kemet** (fusing Afro-Caribbean rhythms, marching-band energy, and UK club culture), **The Comet Is Coming** (cosmic, electronic-infused jazz), and **Shabaka and the Ancestors** (drawing deeply from South Africa’s jazz lineage).[1][3][5] Across these projects and his own releases, including the 2022 EP *Afrikan Culture*, he has developed a style rooted in the legacies of American jazz yet strongly informed by Afro-Caribbean traditions, London dance music, spiritual jazz, and an increasingly prominent exploration of flutes and other aerophones.[1][2][5]

In the early 2020s Shabaka undertook a significant artistic shift, beginning intensive study of the Japanese shakuhachi and other flutes during the COVID-19 pandemic and finding that these instruments “slowly changed the scope of [his] musical inner landscape.”[1][2] On New Year’s Day 2023 he publicly announced that from 2024 he would take a hiatus from playing saxophone in public, stepping away from ensembles where saxophone was his primary instrument, including Sons of Kemet, The Comet Is Coming, and Shabaka and the Ancestors, to focus on a more meditative, flute-centered practice.[1] At the same time he convened a wide circle of admired peers at Rudy Van Gelder’s historic studio in New Jersey—collaborating with artists such as André 3000, Esperanza Spalding, Lianne La Havas, Laraaji, Moses Sumney, Floating Points, and Saul Williams—to document a new phase of his music that emphasizes atmosphere, collective interaction, and ritual, further cementing his status as a central architect of 21st‑century spiritual and experimental jazz.[1][2]

## Fun Facts
- Shabaka was named after the ancient Egyptian pharaoh Neferkare Shabaka, reflecting an early connection to African history and symbolism that later resonated with the Afrofuturist themes in his music.[4]
- As a teenager in Barbados, he once entered a school pageant by performing Brian McKnight’s R&B ballad “Back at One” on saxophone, an early example of his comfort moving between pop and jazz contexts.[4]
- Before his rise as a bandleader, Shabaka took on a wide variety of gigs in London—from Bollywood festivals and film-score work to a Benny Goodman–style clarinet part for a New York City health-care advertisement—building the versatility that underpins his later projects.[4]
- During the COVID‑19 pandemic he began studying the Japanese shakuhachi and other flutes, a practice that transformed his musical direction so deeply that he eventually announced a hiatus from performing on saxophone in public starting in 2024.[1]
