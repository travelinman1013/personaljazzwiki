## Biography
Sister Carol, born Carol Theresa East on January 15, 1959, in Kingston, Jamaica, is a pioneering reggae artist celebrated for her dynamic presence and cultural influence. Raised in the Denham Town district of West Kingston, she moved with her family to Brooklyn, New York, at age 14. Her father, Howard East, was a senior engineer at Radio Jamaica and contributed to recording sessions at the legendary Studio One, immersing Carol in music from an early age. She earned a Bachelor of Science in Education from City College of New York in 1981, the same year she gave birth to her first child.

Encouraged by Jamaican DJ Brigadier Jerry, Sister Carol transitioned from singing to DJ chatting in the dancehall style, quickly establishing herself in New York’s burgeoning reggae scene. Her debut album, 'Liberation for Africa' (1983), was followed by the influential 'Black Cinderella' (1984), which solidified her reputation. Over a four-decade career, she has released more than 20 albums, including the Grammy-nominated 'Lyrically Potent' (1996), and founded her own Black Cinderella label. Sister Carol’s music blends roots reggae, dancehall, and rocksteady, marked by conscious lyrics and a strong feminist voice.

Known as the 'Black Cinderella' and 'Mother Culture,' Sister Carol has toured internationally and collaborated with a wide range of artists. She is also recognized for her appearances in several Jonathan Demme films, such as 'Something Wild' and 'Married to the Mob.' Her legacy endures as a trailblazer for women in reggae and a vital force in the global spread of Jamaican music.
