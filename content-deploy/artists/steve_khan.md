## Biography
Steve Khan, born Steven Harris Cahn on April 28, 1947, in Los Angeles, California, is an acclaimed American jazz guitarist known for his innovative contributions to jazz, fusion, and Latin jazz. Khan initially pursued psychology at UCLA before switching to music composition and theory, graduating in 1969. He began his musical journey as a drummer but transitioned to guitar at age 19, studying privately with Ron Anthony and immersing himself in the works of jazz greats like Wes Montgomery, Kenny Burrell, Grant Green, and Jim Hall. After moving to New York in 1970, Khan quickly established himself as a sought-after session player and sideman, collaborating with artists such as the Brecker Brothers, Steely Dan, Billy Joel, and Phoebe Snow.

Khan's solo career took off in the late 1970s with a trio of albums for Columbia Records—'Tightrope,' 'The Blue Man,' and 'Arrows'—featuring prominent musicians like Michael and Randy Brecker, Steve Gadd, and David Sanborn. In 1980, he released 'Evidence,' a solo acoustic album that paid homage to his jazz inspirations, especially Thelonious Monk. Khan continued to push boundaries with his quartet Eyewitness, alongside Anthony Jackson, Manolo Badrena, and Steve Jordan, blending structured jazz-rock with improvisational creativity. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Khan expanded his musical palette, exploring Latin jazz and collaborating with Dave Samuels and Dave Valentin on projects that redefined the guitar's role in the genre.

Steve Khan's legacy is marked by his versatility, technical mastery, and deep respect for jazz tradition. He is recognized as one of the leading interpreters of Thelonious Monk's music and has influenced generations of guitarists through his recordings, performances, and instructional books. His work continues to be celebrated for its sophistication, melodic inventiveness, and cross-genre appeal.
