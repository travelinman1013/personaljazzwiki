## Biography
Herb Alpert, born March 31, 1935 in Los Angeles, California, grew up in a musically inclined family—his father played mandolin and his mother taught violin—which fostered his early interest in music. Alpert began trumpet lessons at age eight and played at dances as a teenager. After serving in the U.S. Army and briefly pursuing acting, he entered the music industry in the late 1950s, writing hit songs and recording as a vocalist. In 1962, inspired by the vibrant atmosphere of Tijuana bullfights, Alpert formed Herb Alpert & the Tijuana Brass and co-founded A&M Records with Jerry Moss. Their debut album, 'The Lonely Bull,' introduced a unique sound blending mariachi, jazz, and pop, which Alpert dubbed 'Ameriachi.'

Throughout the 1960s, Herb Alpert & the Tijuana Brass became a defining force in American pop music, releasing a string of best-selling albums such as 'Whipped Cream & Other Delights' and 'What Now My Love.' Their accessible, upbeat instrumentals and iconic album covers made them household names, and at their peak, the group outsold even the Beatles. Alpert's innovative trumpet style, inventive arrangements, and keen production sense helped the band achieve five number one hits, multiple Grammy Awards, and over 72 million albums sold worldwide. Alpert remains the only artist to have a No. 1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 as both an instrumentalist and a vocalist.

Herb Alpert's legacy extends beyond performance: as a co-founder of A&M Records, he played a pivotal role in shaping the careers of numerous artists and influencing the music industry. His blend of Latin-inspired rhythms, jazz improvisation, and pop sensibility left a lasting mark on American music, and his philanthropic efforts and continued creative output have cemented his status as a cultural icon.
