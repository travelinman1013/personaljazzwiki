- **Spotify Popularity**: 0/100
- **Followers**: 156
- **Born**: Unknown, likely associated with Ceará, Brazil (inferred from song title, not explicitly confirmed)[7]

## Biography
Available evidence indicates that **Jabes Gilleade** is a little-documented, independent recording artist whose work appears on digital platforms but who has not yet attracted sustained media, press, or encyclopedic coverage.[7] His track “Saudade do Meu Ceará,” released in 2020 on Spotify, suggests a personal or emotional connection to the Brazilian state of Ceará and places him within a Lusophone or Brazilian musical context, likely as a contemporary artist working outside the mainstream.[7]

Beyond the existence of this recording and basic platform metadata, there are currently no reliable public sources detailing his early life, broader career development, stylistic profile beyond the single track, or any recognition or legacy. No interviews, label profiles, press reviews, or official biographies surfaced in music databases, news archives, or major reference sites, which aligns with Spotify’s listing of his popularity as minimal or emerging.[7] Given this lack of documentation, any further narrative about his life or career would be speculative and cannot be verified from credible sources.
