## Biography
The Dazz Band is an American R&B and funk group that rose to prominence in the early 1980s, originating from Cleveland, Ohio. The band was formed in 1976 by saxophonist and vocalist Bobby Harris, evolving from the jazz fusion group Bell Telefunk. Initially known as Kinsman Dazz—a name referencing both the Kinsman Grill Lounge where they were the house band and the blend of 'danceable jazz'—the group underwent several lineup changes before signing with Motown Records in 1980 and adopting the name Dazz Band. Key early members included Bobby Harris, Kenny Pettus, Isaac 'Ike' Wiley, Jr., Michael Wiley, and Michael Calhoun, with later additions such as Sennie 'Skip' Martin and Pierre DeMudd strengthening their horn-driven sound.

The Dazz Band's musical style is characterized by a dynamic fusion of funk, post-disco, and R&B, marked by energetic horn sections, synthesizer-driven grooves, and catchy vocal hooks. Their breakthrough came with the 1982 hit 'Let It Whip,' produced by Reggie Andrews, which topped the US Billboard R&B chart and earned the group a Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals. The band continued to enjoy success throughout the 1980s with hits like 'Joystick' and 'Let It All Blow,' the latter becoming their biggest UK single. The Dazz Band's influence extended beyond their own recordings, as they became known for their electrifying live performances and their role in revitalizing funk during a period of transition in Black popular music.

Despite lineup changes and shifts in the musical landscape, the Dazz Band has maintained a lasting legacy within the funk and R&B genres. Their innovative blend of live instrumentation and electronic elements helped bridge the gap between classic funk and the emerging post-disco sound, influencing both contemporaries and future generations of funk and dance musicians. The group remains active, continuing to perform and celebrate the enduring appeal of their signature sound.
