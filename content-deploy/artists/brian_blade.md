## Biography
Brian Blade, born July 25, 1970, in Shreveport, Louisiana, grew up immersed in gospel and praise music at Zion Baptist Church, where his father, Brady L. Blade Sr., served as pastor. Initially learning violin and singing in the church choir, he transitioned to drums by filling in for his older brother, Brady Blade Jr., in the church band. Throughout middle and high school, Blade studied under Dorsey Summerfield Jr. and drew inspiration from jazz icons like John Coltrane, Thelonious Monk, Elvin Jones, Art Blakey, Papa Jo Jones, and Paul Motian. At 18, he moved to New Orleans to attend Loyola University, honing his skills on snare and bass drums in resource-limited gigs.[1][3][5]

In 1992, Blade relocated to New York City, rapidly establishing himself as a premier session drummer, collaborating with Kenny Garrett, Mark Turner, and Joshua Redman. In 1997, he formed the Brian Blade Fellowship Band with pianist Jon Cowherd, bassist Chris Thomas, saxophonists Myron Walden and Melvin Butler, guitarist Jeff Parker, and pedal steel guitarist Dave Easley, releasing their debut album *Brian Blade Fellowship* in 1998 on Blue Note, followed by *Perceptual* in 2000. His style blends gospel roots, jazz innovation, and emotive versatility, making him a first-call musician for diverse artists. From 2000 until Wayne Shorter's death, Blade was a core member of Shorter's quartet with Danilo Pérez and John Patitucci, renowned for their telepathic interplay; he also worked extensively with Chick Corea, Christian McBride, Brad Mehldau, Joni Mitchell, Herbie Hancock, Norah Jones, and others.[1][2][4]

Blade's legacy endures through his leadership of the Fellowship Band, innovative trio projects like *Trilogy* (2013) and *Trilogy 2* (2018) with Chick Corea and Christian McBride—both Grammy winners for Best Jazz Instrumental Album—and 2026 Grammy nominations for *Windows - Live* and *Spirit Fall*. His 2013 ECHO Jazz Award and Grammy for *Trilogy* underscore his influence in pushing jazz boundaries while honoring tradition.[1]
