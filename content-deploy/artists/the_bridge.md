## Biography
The Bridge is an American jam band originating from Baltimore, Maryland, formed between 2001 and 2002. The band quickly established itself with a reputation for dynamic live performances, blending genres such as rock, blues, folk, funk, and bluegrass. The original lineup featured Cris Jacobs (guitar, vocals), Kenny Liner (mandolin, vocals), Dave Markowitz (bass, vocals), Patrick Rainey (saxophone), Mike Gambone (drums), and Mark Brown (keyboards). Earlier members included Paul Weinberg (drums) and Ryan Porter (bass), with some members having played together in high school bands like Big Fat and Black Eyed Susan, which fostered their musical chemistry and collaborative spirit[2].

Throughout the 2000s, The Bridge cultivated a strong following in the Maryland and Washington D.C. area, expanding their reach through extensive touring across the United States and into western Europe. Their discography includes albums such as 'Cross Street Market' (2004), 'The Bridge' (2006), 'Blind Man's Hill' (2008), and 'National Bohemian' (2011), each showcasing their genre-blending style and improvisational prowess. The band's music is characterized by soulful vocals, intricate instrumental interplay, and a willingness to experiment with traditional American musical forms, earning them a loyal fanbase and critical acclaim within the jam band circuit[2][7].

The Bridge announced their breakup in May 2011, playing their final show on Thanksgiving Eve of that year. However, their legacy endured, and they reunited for a special performance at the 2012 All Good Music Festival. Their influence persists in the regional music scene, both through their recordings and the continued activity of individual members, notably Cris Jacobs, who has pursued a successful solo career[2].
