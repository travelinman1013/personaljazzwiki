## Biography
Morris Day, born Morris E. Day on December 13, 1957, in Springfield, Illinois, grew up in Minneapolis, Minnesota, where he developed his musical talents as a skilled drummer. Attending high school with Prince Rogers Nelson and André Cymone, Day joined their early band Grand Central (later Champagne) in 1974, managed by his mother, laying the foundation for his funk-infused career. Prince later recruited Day as the charismatic lead singer for The Time in 1981, a side project contrasting Prince's style with street-wise R&B and funk, featuring hits like 'Get It Up,' 'Cool,' 'Jungle Love,' and 'The Bird' across albums such as *The Time* (1981), *What Time Is It?* (1982), and *Ice Cream Castle* (1984).[1][2][3][4]

Day's persona as a flamboyant playboy, often accompanied by valet Jerome Benton with his signature mirror routine, exploded with his role as Prince's rival in the 1984 film *Purple Rain*, cementing his stage bravado and contributing to the Minneapolis sound. After The Time's initial run, Day launched a solo career with albums like *The Color of Success* (1985), *Daydreaming* (1987) featuring the hit 'Fishnet,' and *Guaranteed* (1992), blending funk, new jack swing, and R&B. He reunited with The Time periodically, including in films like *Graffiti Bridge* (1990) and *Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back* (2001), while overcoming personal struggles like drug addiction and depression.[1][2][3][5]

In later years, Day continued touring with The Time's original members, releasing projects like *Condensate* (2011) and announcing his final solo album *Last Call* in 2022 ahead of a 2023–2024 retirement tour. His legacy endures through his influence on funk rock and new jack swing, his acting roles, and the timeless appeal of The Time's party anthems, with recent sampling by hip-hop artists reviving interest.[1][3][6]

## Fun Facts
- Day was a gifted drummer who played on most tracks of The Time's first two albums, often starting songs with Prince on bass and drums before the full band joined.[5]
- His exaggerated vanity persona, including the catchphrase 'Jerome, bring me my mirror!', was popularized in *Purple Rain* and became a comic staple on The Time's records.[2]
- Inspired by zoot suit photos of his grandfather, Day developed his iconic flamboyant fashion style from a young age.[3]
- In 2001's *Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back*, Day and The Time served as a running plot device, culminating in a performance of 'Jungle Love' introduced by Jason Mewes.[1][3]
