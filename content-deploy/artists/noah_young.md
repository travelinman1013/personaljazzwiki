## Biography
Noah Young is a New Orleans-based bassist, composer, and founding member of the acclaimed jazz/funk outfit Naughty Professor. Born in Vermont in 1991, Young began learning bass guitar at age 12 and moved to New Orleans in 2010 at age 19 to study with local music legends. Over the past 13+ years, he has established himself as one of the most sought-after bassists in New Orleans, earning nominations for "Best Bassist" from OffBeat Magazine in 2017, 2022, and 2023. His work spans collaborations with diverse artists including The Revivalists, Big Freedia, Marcus King, George Porter Jr., Ivan Neville, and many others, while maintaining a prolific touring schedule that has taken him across North America and Europe.

Young's musical identity is characterized by his fusion of New Orleans funk with adventurous compositional voice and innovative sound. Since 2015, he has led the Noah Young Band, a funk/jazz/fusion project that showcases his original compositions and has released multiple albums. The band features some of New Orleans' most talented young players and maintains a weekly Sunday night residency at Bacchanal Wine Bar. His 2019 album "Splinter" received airplay on local stations and featured the single "Six Million Ways to Die" on Spotify's official State of Jazz playlist. In 2023, Young recorded his most personal and expansive work to date, the self-titled album "Noah," produced by Grammy Award-winning drummer and producer Jamison Ross, which was released in September 2025.

Young's performances have taken him to prestigious venues and festivals worldwide, including the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, FIMU in Belfort France, Rudy's Jazz Room in Nashville, and the Discover Jazz Festival in Burlington, Vermont. His musical approach is described as moving in multiple directions simultaneously—blending post-bop sensibilities, acid-jazz elements, and possessed fusion—conducted in an almost orchestral fashion. Critics have noted that his modern NOLA jazz sound represents a unique synthesis of styles that is both deeply familiar and refreshingly forward-thinking.
