## Biography
Dr. John & The Lower 911 was the late-career touring and recording band of Malcolm John 'Mac' Rebennack Jr., better known as Dr. John, a legendary musician from New Orleans. Born on November 20, 1941, in New Orleans, Dr. John began his musical journey as a teenage guitarist and songwriter, working with local R&B legends and quickly establishing himself as a versatile session musician. After a gun injury in 1960 forced him to switch from guitar to piano, he developed a unique style blending New Orleans blues, jazz, R&B, funk, and psychedelic rock, often infused with the mystique of local Voudou and carnival traditions.[2][3][4][5]

Dr. John moved to Los Angeles in the 1960s, where he became a sought-after session musician and launched his solo career with the creation of his flamboyant alter ego, Dr. John the Night Tripper. His debut album, 'Gris-Gris' (1968), introduced audiences to a mystical, theatrical blend of New Orleans music and psychedelic funk. Throughout his career, Dr. John became an ambassador for New Orleans music, earning multiple Grammy Awards and collaborating with a wide array of artists. In the 2000s, he formed The Lower 911, a band that helped him record and tour, most notably on the Grammy-winning album 'City That Care Forgot' (2008), which addressed the devastation of Hurricane Katrina and the resilience of his hometown.[1][2][4][5]

Dr. John & The Lower 911 continued to celebrate and evolve the traditions of New Orleans music, with Dr. John serving as both a preserver and innovator of the city's sound. His legacy endures as one of the most influential and distinctive voices in American music, revered for his musicianship, showmanship, and unwavering dedication to the cultural heritage of New Orleans.[1][2][3][4][5]
