## Biography
Wilbert Harrison (January 5, 1929 – October 26, 1994) was an American singer, pianist, guitarist, and harmonica player, best remembered for his chart-topping 1959 hit "Kansas City." Born in Charlotte, North Carolina, Harrison grew up surrounded by gospel and country music, developing his musical skills on the family player piano and later teaching himself guitar. After serving in the U.S. Navy, he was exposed to calypso music in Miami, which he incorporated into his eclectic style—a blend of R&B, boogie-woogie, doo-wop, country, and even calypso influences.[1][2][6]

Harrison's early career involved performances in Miami and recordings for Henry Stone before moving to Newark, New Jersey, where he signed with Savoy Records. His breakthrough came after recording "Kansas City" for Bobby Robinson's Fury Records, which became a #1 hit on both R&B and pop charts in 1959 and sold over a million copies. Despite legal disputes over contracts and royalties, the song's success established Harrison as a significant figure in the evolution of rock and roll. He continued to record and perform throughout the 1960s and 1970s, scoring another hit with "Let's Work Together" in 1970, a song later covered by notable artists like Canned Heat and Bryan Ferry.[1][2]

Harrison's legacy is marked by his unique sound, versatility as a multi-instrumentalist, and influence on both soul and rock music. His recording of "Kansas City" was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame and is listed among the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll. He was inducted into the North Carolina Music Hall of Fame in 2009, and his work continues to inspire musicians across genres.[2][4]
