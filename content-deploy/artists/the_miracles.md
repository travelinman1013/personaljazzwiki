## Biography
The Miracles, formed in Detroit, Michigan in the mid-1950s, were pivotal architects of the Motown sound and one of the most influential vocal groups in American music history. Originally known as The Five Chimes and later The Matadors, the group solidified its classic lineup with William 'Smokey' Robinson, Claudette Rogers Robinson, Ronnie White, Bobby Rogers, and Warren 'Pete' Moore, with guitarist Marv Tarplin joining in 1958. Their fortunes changed after a serendipitous meeting with Berry Gordy Jr., who was then a budding songwriter and producer. Gordy recognized Smokey Robinson's songwriting talent and, encouraged by Robinson, founded what would become Motown Records, with The Miracles as his first signed act.[1][2][3][5][6][7]

The Miracles scored Motown’s first million-selling single with 'Shop Around' in 1960, launching a string of hits throughout the 1960s including 'You’ve Really Got a Hold on Me,' 'The Tracks of My Tears,' 'Ooo Baby Baby,' and 'Going to a Go-Go.' Their sound—marked by smooth harmonies, Robinson’s expressive tenor, and Tarplin’s distinctive guitar—helped define the Motown aesthetic, blending doo-wop, soul, and pop. The group’s name changed to 'Smokey Robinson & The Miracles' in 1967, reflecting Robinson’s central role as lead singer, songwriter, and producer. The Miracles’ influence extended beyond their own recordings, as Robinson wrote and produced hits for other Motown acts, shaping the label’s success.[1][2][3][4][5][6][7]

After Robinson’s departure in 1972 to pursue a solo career and executive duties at Motown, The Miracles continued to record and tour, achieving a final major hit with 'Love Machine' in 1975. The group’s legacy is profound: they were instrumental in launching Motown as a cultural force, inspired generations of artists, and left an indelible mark on soul, R&B, and pop music.[1][2][3][4][5][6][7]
