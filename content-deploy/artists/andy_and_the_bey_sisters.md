## Biography
Andy and the Bey Sisters was a vocal trio formed in the late 1950s by pianist-vocalist Andy Bey and his two older sisters, Salome Bey and Geraldine Bey (de Haas). Andy Bey, born October 28, 1939, in Newark, New Jersey, was a genuine child prodigy who began performing professionally at age eight, appearing on television shows like "The Star Time Kids" and at the Apollo Theater before his teenage years. At age 17, the three siblings combined their considerable vocal talents to create a sophisticated jazz cabaret act that drew upon jazz, blues, gospel, R&B, Broadway, and pop influences. Their dark-toned family blend, featuring upbeat standards, crowd-pleasing special material, and impersonations of artists like Eartha Kitt and Pearl Bailey, quickly gained international recognition.

The trio achieved significant acclaim in Europe, particularly after their 1958 booking at the prestigious Blue Note in Paris, which led to a 16-month European tour. They were hailed by the London Daily Herald as "the world's most exciting vocal group" at a time when Lambert, Hendricks & Ross were at their peak, and Newport Jazz Festival founder George Wein brought them back to the United States to perform at his Boston jazz club, Storyville. Despite their artistic success and critical acclaim, Andy and the Bey Sisters recorded only three albums—one for RCA Victor in 1961 and two for Prestige in 1964 and 1965—before disbanding in 1966-1967. The group's lack of commercial success was partly attributed to industry discrimination, with an RCA executive reportedly slow-rolling their promotion. After the trio's breakup, Andy Bey pursued a solo career that eventually led to a resurgence in the 1990s, while the legacy of Andy and the Bey Sisters remained a testament to their innovative blending of multiple musical genres and their sophisticated vocal artistry.

## Fun Facts
- Andy Bey recorded his first single, 'Mama's Little Boy Got the Blues,' for Jubilee Records at age 13 in piercing, pubescent tones, singing about how 'a bobbysoxer broke my heart!' on the NBC children's show 'The Star Time Kids,' which also gave Connie Francis her start.
- The London Daily Herald called Andy and the Bey Sisters 'the world's most exciting vocal group' during a time when the highly acclaimed Lambert, Hendricks & Ross were at their peak, yet an RCA executive admitted to deliberately slow-rolling the trio's promotion, reportedly saying 'George, don't you think that they're too black?'
- Footage of Andy and the Bey Sisters delighting a Parisian audience appears in Chet Baker's 1988 documentary 'Let's Get Lost,' preserving their European performances for posterity.
- After the trio disbanded in 1966-1967, Andy Bey found himself adrift and eventually wound up playing background piano at a Holiday Inn in Terre Haute, Indiana, before being swept into the Civil Rights Movement in 1968 following the murder of Martin Luther King Jr.
