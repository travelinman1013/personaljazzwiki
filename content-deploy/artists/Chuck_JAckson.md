## Biography
Charles Benjamin Jackson, known as Chuck Jackson, was born in Winston-Salem, North Carolina in 1937 and raised in Latta, South Carolina.  His early musical experiences involved singing in a gospel group.  At age 13, he moved to Pittsburgh, laying the groundwork for his future career.  His musical journey was significantly influenced by his time with The Del-Vikings (1957-1959), where he sang lead vocals on their 1957 release "Willette."  A pivotal moment arrived when he was "discovered" by Luther Dixon after performing at the Apollo Theater, opening for Jackie Wilson. This led to a recording contract with Wand Records, a subsidiary of Scepter Records.

Jackson's career took off with his first hit, "I Don't Want to Cry!", co-written with Luther Dixon and released in 1961.  This success was followed by his signature song, "Any Day Now," a Burt Bacharach-Bob Hilliard composition, which became a major hit in 1962.  His rising popularity in the 1960s led him to buy out his contract with Scepter and move to Motown Records, a decision he later regretted. While at Motown, he recorded successful singles such as "Honey Come Back," but later recordings for other labels yielded less success.  Later in his career, he collaborated with producer/composer Charles Wallert on tracks like "How Long Have You Been Loving Me" and teamed up with Dionne Warwick on "If I Let Myself Go," which received critical acclaim.

Chuck Jackson's musical style blended R&B influences with pop sensibilities.  He was one of the first artists to successfully record material by Burt Bacharach and Hal David.  His legacy extends beyond his own recordings; several of his songs became hits for other artists, including Ronnie Milsap's No. 1 country and adult contemporary hit with "Any Day Now," Michael McDonald's successful cover of "I Keep Forgettin'," and David Bowie's rendition of the same song.  His song "I Can't Break Away" was even featured in the film *Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure*.  Jackson's enduring impact is further evidenced by his induction into the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame in 2015, and continued use of his music in commercials and video games.  He passed away on February 16, 2023, at the age of 85.
