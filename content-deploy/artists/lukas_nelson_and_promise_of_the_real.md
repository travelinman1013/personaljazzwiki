## Biography
Lukas Nelson & Promise of the Real is an American band formed in 2008 by Lukas Nelson, the son of country legend Willie Nelson, after meeting drummer Anthony LoGerfo at a Neil Young concert. Raised in Luck, Texas and Maui, Lukas grew up immersed in music, performing alongside his father from a young age and absorbing influences from classic country, rock, and Americana traditions[1][7]. The band's name is a nod to Neil Young's song 'Walk On,' reflecting their commitment to authenticity and musical integrity[1][3][7].

Promise of the Real quickly established themselves as a dynamic force in Americana and alt-country, blending country, rock, soul, and folk into a distinctive sound. Their breakout came after serving as Neil Young's backing band on tour and in the studio for albums such as 'The Monsanto Years' (2015) and 'The Visitor' (2017), as well as the live album 'Earth' (2016)[3][7]. The group also gained wider recognition for their role in the 2018 film 'A Star Is Born,' where they performed as Bradley Cooper's character's band and contributed to the Grammy-winning soundtrack alongside Lady Gaga[1][2][3].

Over 15 years, Lukas Nelson & Promise of the Real released multiple acclaimed albums, including their self-titled 2017 release which debuted at #2 on the Billboard Country Albums chart[3]. The band announced an indefinite hiatus in June 2024, but their legacy endures through their genre-blending music, collaborations with iconic artists, and influence on contemporary Americana[1][3].
