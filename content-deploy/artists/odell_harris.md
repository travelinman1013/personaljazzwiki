## Biography
Odell Harris was a Mississippi-born blues musician renowned for his raw, electrified country blues style. Emerging from the hills of North Mississippi, Harris spent decades playing music in relative obscurity, often performing in local juke joints and informal gatherings. Despite his lifelong dedication to the blues and connections to many legendary musicians, Harris did not make his recording debut until 2006, when Broke and Hungry Records released his album 'Searching for Odell Harris.'[1][2]

His music is characterized by ragged, heavily amplified country blues, drawing comparisons to the works of R.L. Burnside and Junior Kimbrough, as well as his uncle, the famed blues guitarist Albert King. Harris's only known album quickly became a staple for Delta and Hill Country blues enthusiasts, praised for its authenticity and energy. The recording session for 'Searching for Odell Harris' was reportedly an all-night, alcohol-fueled affair on Mississippi’s Gulf Coast, further adding to the mystique surrounding Harris’s life and career.[1]

Odell Harris passed away at the age of 75 in Harvey, Louisiana, leaving behind a legacy as a 'wild man of the blues.' His brief but impactful recording career and his connections to major figures in the blues world have cemented his status as a cult favorite among blues aficionados, even as much of his life remains shrouded in mystery.[1]
