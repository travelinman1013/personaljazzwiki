## Biography
Horace Andy, born Horace Keith Hinds on February 19, 1951, in Kingston, Jamaica, is a legendary roots reggae singer and songwriter renowned for his distinctive, soulful vocals often described as the 'sweetest voice in reggae music.' He began his recording career in 1967 at age 16 with producer Phil Pratt, recording his first single 'This Is a Black Man's Country,' which failed to gain traction. His breakthrough came in 1970 when he auditioned for the renowned Jamaican producer Clement 'Coxsone' Dodd at Studio One. Dodd gave him the stage name 'Horace Andy' as a tribute to Bob Andy of the Paragons, helping to distinguish him from his already-successful cousin Justin Hinds. At Studio One, Andy recorded several influential tracks including 'See A Man's Face,' 'Mr. Bassie,' and most significantly, 'Skylarking,' which became his signature song and topped the Jamaican charts with its message encouraging wayward youth to reform.

Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Andy established himself as a key figure in reggae's evolution, particularly in the development of dancehall reggae. His 1978 album 'Pure Ranking' anticipated the rise of dancehall, while his 1982 album 'Dance Hall Style' on the Bullwackie's label cemented his influence on the genre. Andy's career reached international prominence in 1990 when he began collaborating with Bristol-based trip-hop pioneers Massive Attack, a partnership that would define the latter portion of his career. He contributed to all five of Massive Attack's studio albums, most notably performing on their 1998 album 'Mezzanine,' where he sang on five tracks including the iconic 'Angel' (a new version of 'You Are My Angel'). His work with Massive Attack exposed him to younger, global audiences and demonstrated his remarkable versatility across musical genres.

Beyond his Massive Attack collaborations, Andy has maintained a prolific recording career spanning over five decades. He worked with producer Mad Professor in the mid-1990s, releasing albums such as 'Life Is for Living' and 'Roots and Branches,' and continued recording solo material including 'Living in the Flood' (1999) and 'Mek It Bun' (2002). He also appeared on the world music project '1 Giant Leap' and the Easy Star All-Stars' 2006 reggae reinterpretation album 'Radiodread.' Known by the nickname 'Sleepy,' Andy has remained a respected and influential figure across multiple reggae subgenres including roots reggae, rocksteady, lover's rock, and dancehall, consistently performing and recording around the world while maintaining his artistic integrity and spiritual principles.
