## Biography
Cousin Leroy was the stage name of **Leroy Rozier** (also documented as Leroy Asbell), a singer, guitarist and harmonica player born on September 30, 1925 in Chester, Georgia, USA.[1][4][6][8] He came from a rural Southern background and, like many postwar bluesmen, moved north, eventually surfacing in New York City’s rhythm-and-blues scene in the mid‑1950s.[1][4][5] Very little is known for certain about his early life, but accounts consistently place his origins in rural Georgia and describe him as a largely mysterious figure whose personal history was only partially reconstructed by later blues researchers.[1][4][5]

Cousin Leroy’s recording career was brief but distinctive, running roughly from 1955 to 1957, during which he cut a small body of sides for New York independent labels.[3][4][6] His records were firmly rooted in the **down‑home blues** tradition even as they were marketed in the R&B era, with rough‑edged vocals, driving guitar, and prominent harmonica that put the “blues” ahead of smoother commercial influences.[4] Later critics described his work as an example of postwar New York blues that preserved a Southern feel, and his scarcity on record, combined with fragmentary biographical data, has made him one of the more enigmatic figures of postwar blues scholarship.[1][4][5] Despite limited commercial impact, his recordings have been reissued and discussed by blues historians, ensuring a modest legacy among collectors and genre specialists.[1][3][4][5]

Cousin Leroy’s later life and date of death remain uncertain in published sources, contributing to his reputation as a “lost” or “mysterious” artist in postwar blues history.[1][5] Nevertheless, modern discographies and reissue notes have helped document his complete known output and confirm his identity under multiple name variants, preserving his place as a minor but intriguing voice in the 1950s New York blues milieu.[1][3][4][6]

## Fun Facts
- Cousin Leroy recorded under multiple civil names and nicknames, including **Leroy Rozier**, reportedly born Leroy Asbell, and the alias **“Chewin’ Gum.”**[1][3][6]
- Blues writers describe him as one of the **most mysterious figures in postwar blues**, with key details of his life and death still undocumented.[1][5]
- Although active in the peak R&B era, his records are noted for putting the emphasis **squarely on traditional blues** rather than the more polished R&B sound of the time.[4]
- His known recording career was extremely short, concentrated between **1955 and 1957**, which adds to the rarity and collector interest in his original singles.[3][6]
