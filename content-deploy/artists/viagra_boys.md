## Biography
Viagra Boys are a Swedish post-punk band formed in Stockholm in 2015, known for their raw, chaotic sound and satirical take on masculinity and modern society. The group was founded after a night out at a karaoke bar, where American vocalist Sebastian Murphy impressed tattoo artist Henrik Höckert with his unique rendition of Mariah Carey's "We Belong Together." This encounter led to the formation of the band, with Murphy on vocals and Höckert on bass, soon joined by guitarist Benjamin Vallé, drummer Tor Sjödén, saxophonist Oscar Carls, and keyboardist Elias Jungqvist[1][2][5][6]. Murphy, originally from San Francisco, brought a distinctive presence to the band, both visually and vocally, often performing in tracksuits and sunglasses, channeling a persona that lampoons hypermasculinity[4].

Viagra Boys quickly gained a cult following in Sweden for their uncompromising fusion of pounding hard rock grooves, minimalist melodies, discordant guitar and sax, and howling vocals. Their debut EP, "Consistency of Energy" (2016), set the creative template, followed by the critically acclaimed full-length "Street Worms" (2018), which expanded their audience across Europe and North America[1][2]. Their sophomore album "Welfare Jazz" (2021) and third album "Cave World" (2022) further refined their sound, earning them the Rock of the Year award at the Swedish Grammis in 2023[2]. The band's lyrics often explore themes of drugs, anger, and the failures of male privilege, delivered with a mix of self-loathing and dark humor[4].

Viagra Boys have become renowned for their unpredictable and energetic live shows, as well as their ability to blend punk, funk, and satirical commentary. Their legacy lies in their subversive approach to post-punk, challenging societal norms while maintaining an irreverent, escapist spirit. The band's influence continues to grow, inspiring a new wave of punk acts with their fearless attitude and genre-defying sound[1][2][4].
