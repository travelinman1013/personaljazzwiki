## Biography
The Eagles are an American rock band formed in Los Angeles, California, in 1971, becoming one of the defining acts of 1970s rock and country rock.[4][3] The original lineup—Glenn Frey, Don Henley, Bernie Leadon, and Randy Meisner—first came together as part of Linda Ronstadt’s backing band, where their onstage chemistry led them to form their own group and sign with David Geffen’s new Asylum Records label.[4][3][5] Their self‑titled debut album, released in 1972 and produced by Glyn Johns, blended rock, country, and folk and yielded early hits such as “Take It Easy” and “Witchy Woman,” establishing their smooth harmonies, polished songwriting, and laid‑back California sound.[1][4][5]

Through the mid‑1970s the Eagles evolved from country‑rock toward a harder, more mainstream rock sound, aided by the addition of guitarist Don Felder in 1974 and former James Gang guitarist Joe Walsh in 1975.[4][5][2] Albums such as *On the Border* (1974), *One of These Nights* (1975), and especially *Hotel California* (1976) produced multiple hit singles, including “Best of My Love,” “One of These Nights,” “Lyin’ Eyes,” and the iconic “Hotel California,” helping the band rack up five U.S. number‑one singles, six number‑one albums, and multiple Grammy and American Music Awards.[4] Internal tensions and the pressures of fame led to lineup changes—Meisner was replaced by Timothy B. Schmit in 1977—and after releasing *The Long Run* (1979), the band broke up in 1980, with members pursuing solo careers.[4][2]

The Eagles reunited in 1994 for the *Hell Freezes Over* project and tour, reestablishing their status as a major live act and leading to their induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998, where all seven key members performed together.[4][5] They later released *Long Road Out of Eden* in 2007, which became their sixth U.S. number‑one album, and they have continued to tour in various configurations, even after the death of Glenn Frey in 2016, with Frey’s son Deacon Frey and country artist Vince Gill joining the lineup.[4] Stylistically, the band is known for tight vocal harmonies, melodic guitar work, and a fusion of country, soft rock, and mainstream rock, and their catalog—highlighted by the compilation *Their Greatest Hits (1971–1975)*, one of the best‑selling albums in history—has cemented their legacy as one of the world’s best‑selling and most influential rock bands.[4][3][5]

## Fun Facts
- All four original members of the Eagles had played for Linda Ronstadt—some on tour and all on her 1972 self‑titled album—before breaking off to form their own band.[4][3][5]
- Their compilation *Their Greatest Hits (1971–1975)* has sold tens of millions of copies and is among the best‑selling albums of all time.[4][3]
- Joe Walsh’s first album with the Eagles was *Hotel California* (1976), which went on to become the band’s most iconic and critically acclaimed record.[2][4]
- At their 1998 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction, all seven principal members—Frey, Henley, Leadon, Meisner, Felder, Walsh, and Schmit—performed together onstage, a rare full‑lineup reunion.[4][5]
