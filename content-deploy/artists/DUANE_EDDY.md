## Biography
Duane Eddy (April 26, 1938 – April 30, 2024) was a pioneering American guitarist celebrated for his distinctive 'twangy' guitar sound, which became a hallmark of late 1950s and early 1960s rock and roll and surf rock. Born in Corning, New York, Eddy began playing guitar at age five, inspired by cowboy singer Gene Autry. After his family relocated to Arizona, he formed a duo with Jimmy Delbridge and performed locally, eventually leaving school at sixteen to pursue music full-time.

Eddy's career took off after meeting producer Lee Hazlewood in 1957, who encouraged him to focus on the lower strings of his guitar, leading to his signature sound. His debut single, 'Movin' and Groovin',' and subsequent hits like 'Rebel Rouser,' 'Peter Gunn,' and 'Because They're Young' propelled him to national and international fame. By 1963, he had sold over 12 million records, making him one of the most successful instrumentalists of his era. His collaborations with saxophonist Steve Douglas and his band, The Rebels, further defined his sound, and his innovative use of tremolo, echo, and dramatic single-note melodies influenced countless musicians.

Eddy's influence extended well beyond his commercial peak, shaping the sound of rock guitar for generations. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994 and the Musicians Hall of Fame in 2008. His 'twangy' style inspired artists from George Harrison to Bruce Springsteen, and his recordings remain foundational to the genres of surf rock and rockabilly.

## Fun Facts
