## Biography
Walter "Wolfman" Washington (December 20, 1943 – December 22, 2022) was an American singer and guitarist based in New Orleans, Louisiana, who became one of the city's most distinctive musical voices over six decades of performing. Born in the Mid-City neighborhood, Washington grew up surrounded by music, with bluesmen Guitar Slim and Lightnin' Slim as uncles and R&B hitmaker Ernie K-Doe as a cousin. He fashioned his first guitar from a cigar box, clothes hanger, and rubber bands before receiving an acoustic guitar from an uncle. His "Wolfman" moniker came from his ambitious approach as a young guitarist who challenged better-known players onstage—a practice known as "wolfing"—and was christened by fellow musician David Lastie. At age 19, Washington joined Lee Dorsey's touring band in 1962, embarking on his first road experience with a memorable debut at the Apollo Theatre in New York. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, he worked as a sideman with soul legends including Irma Thomas and Johnny Adams, the latter encouraging him to develop his own singing voice and extend it into falsetto.[1][2][3]

Washington stepped into the spotlight as a bandleader in 1986 when he formed the Roadmasters and released his first nationally distributed album, "Wolf Tracks," on the Rounder label. His musical style represented an innovative fusion of blues, funk, R&B, and jazz, creating what keyboardist Jon Cleary described as "an unusual hybrid of soul, funk and jazz." Over three decades, Washington became a New Orleans institution through constant touring and recording with labels including Rounder, Bullseye Blues, Virgin/Point Blank, Zoho, and Anti-. He held legendary weekly residencies at clubs including the Maple Leaf and d.b.a, where he recorded live albums with his band and later performed as a trio with organist Joe Krown and drummer Russell Batiste Jr. His 1999 album "Blue Moon Risin'" featured horn players who had worked with James Brown, while his 2018 album "My Future Is My Past," produced by Galactic member Ben Ellman, marked a stripped-down, intimate return to his roots that resonated deeply with audiences.[1][2][4]

Washington's legacy as a quintessential New Orleans musician was recognized through numerous accolades, including OffBeat Magazine's Lifetime Achievement in Music award in 2018. Known for his trademark vocal howl and distinctive rhythm and blues sound infused with sophisticated soul and jazz elements, he influenced generations of musicians and remained a vital part of the New Orleans music scene until his death from tonsil cancer on December 22, 2022, at age 79.[1][2][7]
