## Biography
Falle Nioke is a Guinea-born singer and multi-instrumentalist now based in Margate, UK, who blends traditional West African music with contemporary electronic elements. Raised in Conakry, Guinea, as a member of the Coniagui tribe, Nioke was inspired by artists such as Oumou Sangaré, Bob Marley, and Sory Kandia Kouyaté to pursue music from an early age. He began performing at 11 years old and eventually joined Nimba Sacré, a group of travelling musicians who performed traditional Guinean music across West Africa. After meeting his British wife on a beach, Nioke relocated to Margate in 2017, where he became immersed in the coastal town's vibrant cultural scene and began collaborating with electronic producers and musicians.[2][3]

Nioke's musical approach is characterized by his ability to sing in multiple languages—including French, English, Fulani, Coniagui, and Susu—while accompanying his voice with traditional West African instruments such as the gongoma, bolon, and cassi.[2] His work has attracted collaborations with notable producers and musicians, including Barry Can't Swim and Hot Chip's Joe Goddard, as well as Mercury Prize winner Mike Lindsay of Tunng and LUMP.[3] His debut album 'Love From The Sea' was released on September 26, 2024, via Eat Your Own Ears Recordings, marking a significant milestone in his career as a striking and sought-after collaborator in the contemporary music landscape.[3]

Joe Goddard is a British musician, songwriter, and DJ born on September 12, 1979, best known as a co-founder of the English synth-pop band Hot Chip.[1] Beyond his work with Hot Chip, Goddard has established himself as a prolific solo artist and producer, releasing three solo albums: 'Harvest Festival' (2009), 'Electric Lines' (2017), and 'Harmonics' (2024).[1] He co-founded the record label Greco-Roman in 2007, which has released albums by artists such as Totally Enormous Extinct Dinosaurs and Disclosure, and is also a member of the electronica group the 2 Bears.[1] In 2021, Goddard formed Hard Feelings with vocalist Amy Douglas, a duo blending dance music with synthpop and new wave sounds.[1]
