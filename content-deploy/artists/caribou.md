## Biography
Dan Snaith, known professionally as Caribou, is a Canadian composer, musician, and recording artist born on March 29, 1978, in London, Ontario, Canada. Snaith began his musical journey under the moniker Manitoba, releasing his debut album 'Start Breaking My Heart' in 2001, followed by the critically acclaimed 'Up In Flames' in 2003. After a legal dispute over the Manitoba name, he adopted the Caribou alias, under which he has released a series of influential albums blending electronic psychedelia, krautrock rhythms, and intricate breakbeat drums. His work is celebrated for its lush, panoramic soundscapes and constant evolution in style.[1][4][7]

Caribou's 2007 album 'Andorra' won the Polaris Music Prize, and subsequent releases such as 'Swim' (2010), 'Our Love' (2014), and 'Suddenly' (2020) have garnered further critical acclaim, including Grammy and Juno nominations. Snaith also explores more club-oriented dance music under the name Daphni. His live performances, often featuring a full band, are renowned for their energy and innovative use of visuals and instrumentation. Caribou has toured globally, performing at major festivals and opening for acts like Radiohead, cementing Snaith's reputation as a leading figure in contemporary electronic music.[1][2][4][6]

Snaith's music is marked by a deep engagement with both personal and musical influences, drawing inspiration from genres as diverse as prog rock, spiritual jazz, and underground dance music. His legacy is defined by his ability to bridge experimental and accessible sounds, influencing a new generation of electronic musicians and continually pushing the boundaries of his craft.[1][3][5]
