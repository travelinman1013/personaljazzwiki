## Biography
Maddy Kirgo, a 29-year-old singer and guitarist, was born and raised in Los Angeles, California, where her father, who owns a music studio, taught her to play guitar starting at age 13. Her early musical exposure drew from a diverse palette including classic R&B, Fleetwood Mac deep cuts, Dolly Parton, and Frank Sinatra, shaping her resistance to genre constraints. Overcoming initial stage fright, she honed her skills by performing with a country band, sharing secret songs on SoundCloud, and busking with her guitar before establishing herself in New Orleans, a city whose eclectic vibe mirrors her songwriting.[1][2]

Now based in New Orleans, Kirgo crafts songs that blend swampy Americana and dreamy pop, eluding easy definition while reflecting the Big Easy's all-embracing attitude. Her debut album, *Shadow On My Light*, released in 2024 via Arkansas-based independent label Gar Hole Records, captures a laid-back, summery essence with her angelic vocal range and soothing melodies spanning indie, country, and pop. The album's relatable, honest vibe evokes beachside solitude, aligning with her personal ethos of focusing on love amid life's complexities.[1][2][3]

Looking ahead, Kirgo plans to record a stripped-down follow-up album emphasizing guitar and introspective lyrics on breakups, new love, family, and global issues, aiming to recapture the intimacy of her bedroom songwriting days. She envisions an ideal solo recording process, complemented by her emerging painting practice, underscoring her multifaceted creativity and thematic focus on human connection.[1]
