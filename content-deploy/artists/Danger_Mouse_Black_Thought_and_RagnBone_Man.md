## Biography
Danger Mouse (Brian Burton) and Black Thought (Tariq Trotter) are two of the most acclaimed figures in contemporary music, each with a storied career before coming together as a duo. Danger Mouse rose to prominence with his genre-bending production on projects like 'The Grey Album' and as one half of Gnarls Barkley, while Black Thought is revered as the frontman of The Roots, known for his incisive lyricism and commanding stage presence. Their paths first crossed in 2005, sparking a creative partnership that would take nearly two decades to fully materialize.

Their collaborative album 'Cheat Codes' (2022) was a critical triumph, praised for its seamless blend of Danger Mouse's cinematic, soul-infused hip-hop production and Black Thought's dexterous wordplay and introspective lyrics. The album featured a roster of high-profile guests and reaffirmed both artists' reputations: Danger Mouse as a pioneering beat-maker with a unique ability to bridge rock and hip-hop, and Black Thought as one of the greatest rappers of his generation. In 2025, the duo released 'Up,' a new single featuring British singer Rag'n'Bone Man, whose soulful vocals added a powerful new dimension to their sound.

Rag'n'Bone Man (Rory Graham) is a British artist best known for his breakout hit 'Human,' which has garnered over 2 billion views on YouTube. His rich, gospel-tinged voice and emotive delivery have made him a sought-after collaborator across genres. On 'Up,' his contribution is both vocal and instrumental, seamlessly integrating with Danger Mouse's production and Black Thought's lyricism to create a track that is cinematic, urgent, and deeply resonant.
