## Biography
James John Witherspoon, known affectionately as 'Spoon,' was born in Gurdon, Arkansas, on August 8, 1920 (though some sources cite 1921 or 1923 due to inconsistent documentation). He grew up in a devoutly religious Baptist family, where his mother served as church pianist and his father worked as a Missouri Pacific Railroad brakeman. Despite his mother's disapproval of blues music, which she considered 'dirty,' young Witherspoon was drawn to secular music heard on jukeboxes and radio. He joined the church choir around age five and demonstrated early musical talent by winning a Clark County singing contest as a child. His ambition to become a professional singer developed in his youth, leading him to move to Los Angeles in the late 1930s, where he worked washing dishes at a local drugstore while pursuing his musical dreams.

Witherspoon's professional career took shape during World War II when he enlisted in the merchant marine, serving as a cook and gaining valuable musical experience performing with Teddy Weatherford's band at the Grand Hotel in Calcutta, India, where they made regular broadcasts over the U.S. Armed Forces Radio Service. After the war, he settled in the San Francisco Bay Area and caught the attention of pianist Jay McShann, joining his band in 1946 after impressing McShann at the Casino Ballroom in Vallejo, California. Witherspoon remained with McShann's ensemble for three years, recording dozens of 78s for labels including Philo, Mercury, and Swing Time. His breakthrough came in 1949 with 'Ain't Nobody's Business' (also known as 'Tain't Nobody's Biz-Ness if I Do'), which spent an extraordinary 34 weeks on the Billboard rhythm and blues charts and became his signature tune. The song, originally popularized by Bessie Smith in 1923, showcased Witherspoon's distinctive vocal style—a versatile instrument that could be as smooth as single-malt Scotch or adopt a rasping, erotic timbre depending on the song's demands.

Throughout his half-century career, Witherspoon became one of the most prominent blues shouters of the 1940s and 1950s, earning respect from both jazz and R&B audiences. His baritone voice and deliciously delayed phrasing made him a favorite among jazz instrumentalists, and he recorded in diverse musical settings with jazz, soul, and rock musicians while always delivering authentic blues. Beyond 'Ain't Nobody's Business,' he achieved additional hits including 'No Rollin' Blues,' 'Big Fine Girl,' 'Failing by Degrees,' and 'New Orleans Woman.' His compositions like 'Times Gettin' Tougher Than Tough' became blues classics. Witherspoon died on September 18, 1997, in Los Angeles, leaving behind a legacy as a versatile artist equally at home in blues, jazz, and rhythm and blues genres.

## Fun Facts
- Witherspoon may have run away from home to Los Angeles as early as 1935, at approximately age 14-15, to pursue his musical ambitions despite his mother's strong objections to blues music.
- During World War II, Witherspoon served as a cook in the merchant marine and was stationed in Calcutta, India, where he performed with Teddy Weatherford's band on U.S. Armed Forces Radio Service broadcasts—gaining international exposure during wartime.
- His signature hit 'Ain't Nobody's Business' was originally recorded in 1947 but didn't achieve massive chart success until 1949, when it spent an incredible 34 weeks on the Billboard rhythm and blues charts, making it one of the most successful blues records of that era.
- Witherspoon's birth year remains somewhat uncertain due to inconsistent documentation across sources; he gave his age as 74 in a 1996 interview, which corresponds to an 1921-1922 birth year, though various sources list 1920 or 1923.
