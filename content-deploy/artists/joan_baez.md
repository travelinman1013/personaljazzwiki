## Biography
Joan Chandos Baez was born on January 9, 1941, in Staten Island, New York, to Albert Baez, a physicist, and Joan Baez Sr. The family moved frequently due to her father's work, including time in Baghdad, Iraq, before settling in California and later Massachusetts. Baez developed an early interest in music, learning the ukulele and singing in choirs, and was drawn to folk music through visits to Cambridge coffeehouses after her family relocated to Belmont in 1958. She briefly attended Boston University but dropped out to pursue performing, starting regular gigs at Club 47 in 1959 and gaining breakthrough exposure at the Newport Folk Festival that year, invited onstage by Bob Gibson.[1][2][4][5]
