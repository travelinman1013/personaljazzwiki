## Biography
Louis Daniel Armstrong, born August 4, 1901, in New Orleans, Louisiana, USA, was a pioneering jazz trumpeter, vocalist, and one of the most influential figures in American music history[2][3]. Raised in poverty, Armstrong was sent to the Waif’s Home for Boys at age 12, where he received formal musical training and discovered his passion for the cornet[6]. After his release, he played in brass bands and on Mississippi riverboats, honing his skills and earning a reputation as a prodigious talent[6][7]. Mentored by Joe 'King' Oliver, Armstrong moved to Chicago in 1922 to join Oliver’s Creole Jazz Band, marking the start of his ascent in the jazz world[2][6].

Armstrong’s career breakthrough came with his innovative solo recordings as leader of the Hot Five and Hot Seven (1925–1928), which redefined jazz by emphasizing virtuosic solo improvisation over collective ensemble playing[3][5]. His technical mastery, expressive phrasing, and pioneering use of scat singing set new standards for jazz musicianship and vocal performance[3][5]. By the 1930s, Armstrong was an international star, performing with big bands, appearing in films, and touring globally. Despite health challenges, including a persistent lip injury, he remained a beloved entertainer, known for his joyful stage presence and gravelly voice. Armstrong’s influence spanned genres, earning him accolades such as Grammy Awards and inductions into multiple music halls of fame[2]. His legacy endures as a foundational force in jazz and popular music, celebrated for both his artistic innovation and his role as a cultural ambassador.

## Fun Facts
- Armstrong earned the nickname 'Satchmo' (short for 'Satchel Mouth') due to his large mouth and embouchure, which contributed to his powerful sound[2].
- He was one of the first African-American entertainers to cross over into mainstream popularity, appearing in Hollywood films and on national television during a time of widespread segregation[2][3].
- Armstrong’s 1964 hit 'Hello, Dolly!' knocked The Beatles off the top of the Billboard charts, making him the oldest artist (at age 62) to achieve a No. 1 single at that time[2].
- Despite his fame, Armstrong faced criticism from some younger jazz musicians in the 1940s and 1950s for his perceived commercialism, though he remained a beloved figure worldwide[3].
