## Biography
The Desert Nudes are a New Orleans-based trio formed during the COVID-19 pandemic, uniting three seasoned musicians: André Bohren, David Pomerleau, and John Paul Carmody. The group’s origins trace to impromptu backyard and porch sessions during lockdowns, where the members—longtime friends and collaborators—reconnected over their shared love for classic cowboy and country songs. Their playful name emerged from stories of desert adventures and a tongue-in-cheek requirement that all members have experienced the desert 'in the altogether.'

Musically, The Desert Nudes blend rock, country, and cowboy standards, drawing inspiration from icons like Marty Robbins, Johnny Cash, and Willie Nelson. Their debut album, 'Keep A-Movin', Dan,' released in 2024 on Lazy Day Records, features reinterpretations of classics such as 'Home on the Range,' 'Ghost Riders in the Sky,' and 'Don’t Fence Me In,' alongside original compositions. The trio’s hallmark is their rich three-part harmonies and dynamic vocal interplay, supported by acoustic instrumentation and a deep reverence for the traditions of the American West.

Though a relatively new project, the members’ deep roots in the New Orleans music scene—particularly through their work with Johnny Sketch and the Dirty Notes—lend the band a sense of seasoned camaraderie and musical sophistication. Their performances, both live and recorded, are marked by warmth, humor, and a genuine affection for the material, positioning The Desert Nudes as both a tribute to and a playful reinvention of classic Americana.
