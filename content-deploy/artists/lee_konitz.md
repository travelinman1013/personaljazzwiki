## Biography
Lee Konitz, born Leon Konitz on October 13, 1927, in Chicago, Illinois, to Austrian and Russian Jewish immigrant parents, began his musical journey at age 11 with the clarinet, inspired by Benny Goodman, before switching to tenor and then alto saxophone under classical training from Lou Honig. His professional career started in 1945 with Teddy Powell's band, followed by stints with Jerry Wald and a pivotal meeting with pianist Lennie Tristano in 1946, whose influence shaped Konitz's mature, non-Parker-esque style emphasizing long melodic lines, rhythmic displacement, and spontaneity. In 1947, he joined Claude Thornhill's orchestra, where he met arrangers Gil Evans and Gerry Mulligan, leading to his inclusion in Miles Davis's Birth of the Cool nonet (1948-1950), a cornerstone of cool jazz.[1][2][5]

Konitz further developed his career with Stan Kenton's big band (1952-1953), then returned to New York to lead prolific small groups, duets, and solo projects while collaborating with Tristano associates like Sal Mosca and Warne Marsh. Rejecting rigid affiliations, he freelanced across bop, cool jazz, and experimental forms, recording hundreds of sessions, taking European tours in the 1960s, and teaching during sabbaticals. Into the 21st century, he worked with younger musicians in groups like the Minsarah trio and quartets featuring Paul Motian, Brad Mehldau, Charlie Haden, Ethan Iverson, and Mark Turner, maintaining innovation over a 75-year career.[1][2][4]

Konitz's legacy as a distinctive alto saxophonist lies in his resistance to Charlie Parker's dominance, pioneering improvisational freedom heard in Tristano recordings like 'Intuition' and 'Digression,' and influencing cool jazz while mentoring generations. He received the NEA Jazz Masters Award in 2009 and continued performing until his death on April 15, 2020, at age 92 from COVID-19 complications in New York.[1][5][6]

## Fun Facts
- Konitz was one of the few alto saxophonists of his era who deliberately avoided imitating Charlie Parker, developing a unique style with odd rhythmic accents and melodic lines.[5][6]
- His 1949 recordings 'Intuition' and 'Digression' with Lennie Tristano were unnotated collective improvisations, predating the free jazz movement by over a decade.[4][6]
- Konitz took a sabbatical from jazz in 1961-1964 to teach in California and spent much of 1965-1966 in Europe, expanding his global influence.[1]
- At age 92, he was still actively performing and recording, including with the Minsarah trio in the late 2000s, up until his death during the COVID-19 pandemic.[1]
