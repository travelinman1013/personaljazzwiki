## Biography
Sunny War, born Sydney Lyndella Ward in 1990 in Nashville, Tennessee, is a singer-songwriter whose music defies easy categorization, blending folk-punk, Americana, blues, gospel, and country into a sound that is both raw and introspective[1][2][5]. Her early life was marked by musical curiosity and personal upheaval: she received her first guitar at age 7, took piano and harmonica lessons, and moved from Tennessee to California during middle school, where she taught herself guitar by mimicking a friend’s stepfather’s banjo technique, developing a distinctive fingerpicking style[1][3]. As a teenager, she experienced periods of homelessness and addiction, busking on Venice Beach and even hopping freight trains, experiences that deeply inform her songwriting’s honesty and emotional resonance[2][3].

War’s career began in earnest in her early twenties when she quit her job to pursue music full-time, self-releasing her debut EP, *Worthless*, in 2014 and selling CDs on the Venice boardwalk[1]. She gained broader recognition with her 2021 album *Simple Syrup* and critical acclaim for *Anarchist Gospel* (2023), which was praised for its emotional depth and genre-blurring ambition[1][5]. Her 2025 album, *Armageddon in a Summer Dress*, further cemented her reputation as a leading voice in contemporary folk-punk and Americana[1]. War’s music is celebrated for its lyrical candor, virtuosic guitar work, and refusal to shy away from life’s darker chapters, making her a standout in today’s roots music scene[2][3][5].
