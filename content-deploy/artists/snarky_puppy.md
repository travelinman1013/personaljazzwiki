## Biography
Snarky Puppy is an American jazz fusion superband led by bassist and primary composer Michael League, founded in 2004 in Denton, Texas. The band originated as a casual ensemble of college friends from the University of North Texas Jazz Studies program, with League forming the group as a way to gain performance experience after not placing into any of the school's official ensembles. What began as a 10-piece group of jazz students evolved dramatically when the band relocated to Dallas and intersected with the local gospel, R&B, and hip-hop communities around 2007. This pivotal moment introduced musicians like drummer Robert "Sput" Searight, keyboardists Shaun Martin and Bobby Sparks, and the influential Bernard Wright, transforming Snarky Puppy's sound from cerebral and academic into something visceral, funky, and emotionally direct.

Over more than two decades, Snarky Puppy has grown into an international phenomenon, with approximately 40 musicians rotating through "The Fam"—the band's affectionate name for its extended roster of collaborators. The ensemble now comprises a 21st-century orchestra featuring three guitarists, four keyboardists, brass and reed sections, strings, multiple percussionists, and drummers, all anchored by League's bass work. The band has achieved significant commercial and critical success, winning five Grammy Awards including Best Contemporary Instrumental Album for "Culcha Vulcha" (2017), "Live at the Royal Albert Hall" (2021), and "Empire Central" (2023). Snarky Puppy has performed over 1,500 concerts across six continents and established its own record label, GroundUP Music, on Ropeadope Records, which supports emerging artists and reflects the band's commitment to fostering the next generation of musicians.

Musically, Snarky Puppy defies easy categorization, blending jazz fusion, funk, rock, world music, and improvisational elements into a distinctive sound that League describes as "a pop band that improvises a lot, without vocals." The band's approach emphasizes collective musicianship and spontaneous interplay rather than traditional song structures, creating dynamic performances that showcase the virtuosity of each ensemble member. Their influence extends beyond instrumental jazz, impacting contemporary fusion and progressive music scenes globally.

## Fun Facts
- Michael League formed Snarky Puppy as a sophomore in college specifically because he 'was so bad' that he didn't place into any of the University of North Texas's official school ensembles, making it his creative workaround to gain performance experience.
- The band's rotating roster system originated from practical necessity: in the early days, when band members received better-paying opportunities elsewhere, substitutes would learn the music so well that League decided to keep them in a 'Rolodex' and rotate musicians in and out, eventually creating the expansive 'Fam' of approximately 40 performers.
- The transformative intersection with Dallas's gospel, R&B, and hip-hop communities occurred just three years after the band's formation, fundamentally shifting their sound from academic jazz to visceral funk-influenced fusion—a turning point League identifies as crucial to the band's identity.
- Despite winning five Grammy Awards and performing over 1,500 concerts across six continents, League maintains a modest approach to leadership, described as 'accomplished yet modest' in keeping the 21st-century orchestra of 20+ musicians together with his bass work.
