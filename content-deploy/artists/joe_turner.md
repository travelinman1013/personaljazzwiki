## Biography
Big Joe Turner, born Joseph Vernon Turner, Jr. on May 18, 1911, in Kansas City, Missouri, emerged as one of the most influential blues shouters of the 20th century. Growing up in the vibrant nightlife of Kansas City during Prohibition, Turner began his career as a singing bartender, where his powerful, commanding voice quickly drew attention. He formed a pivotal partnership with pianist Pete Johnson, and together they became fixtures in the city’s clubs before gaining national recognition after a landmark performance at Carnegie Hall’s 1938 'Spirituals to Swing' concert. This success led Turner to New York, where he became a popular performer in nightclubs and began recording with leading jazz and blues musicians.

Turner’s style blended jazz, boogie-woogie, blues, and early rhythm and blues, helping to shape the jump blues genre and paving the way for rock and roll. His robust baritone and energetic delivery made songs like 'Shake, Rattle and Roll,' 'Honey Hush,' and 'Flip, Flop and Fly' national hits in the 1950s, many of which were later covered by rock and roll artists such as Bill Haley. Throughout his five-decade career, Turner recorded for major labels, performed with jazz greats, and remained a dynamic presence on stage. Revered as the 'Boss of the Blues,' his influence extended across generations and genres, earning him a place in the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and the Blues Hall of Fame. Turner continued to perform and record into his seventies, passing away in Inglewood, California, on November 24, 1985.
