## Biography
The Wild West is a Los Angeles-based supergroup formed by six accomplished female singer-songwriters: Manda Mosher, Tawny Ellis, Heather Anne Lomax, Amilia K Spicer, Pi Jacobs, and Deb Morrison. Each member brings a rich history of solo success and a distinctive voice to the ensemble, creating a blend of southern rock, Americana, and roots music. The group emerged from a deep friendship and mutual respect, channeling their collective experiences into powerful harmonies and songwriting that reflect both individual artistry and shared vision.

Their debut single, 'Better Way,' showcased their collaborative spirit and was lauded for its empowering message and intricate harmonies. The Wild West quickly gained recognition, being named one of the 'Top Ten Emerging Acts of 2021' by Holler Country at Nashville’s AMERICANAFEST. Their follow-up release, a unique rendition of Neil Young’s 'Comes A Time' featuring violinist Scarlet Rivera and mixed by Bob Clearmountain, further cemented their reputation for creative reinterpretation and musical excellence.

The group’s musical style is rooted in southern rock, but also draws heavily from Americana, country, and folk traditions. Their work is characterized by lush vocal arrangements, heartfelt lyricism, and a commitment to authenticity. As a collective, The Wild West represents a new chapter in the evolution of southern rock, bringing female voices and perspectives to the forefront of a genre historically dominated by men.
