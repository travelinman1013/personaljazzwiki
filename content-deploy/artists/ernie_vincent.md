## Biography
Ernie Vincent, born and raised in New Orleans, Louisiana, emerged as a pivotal figure in the city’s vibrant funk, R&B, and blues scenes beginning in the early 1960s. He started his musical journey as a teenager, forming his first band, Li’l Ernie and the Alpines, and quickly became known for his energetic guitar playing and knack for arranging tight, danceable grooves. Vincent’s breakthrough came in 1972 with the local hit 'Dap Walk,' recorded at Cosimo Matassa’s legendary J&M Recording Studio. This track, with its infectious rhythm and sharp guitar work, cemented Vincent’s reputation and led to decades of steady work in New Orleans’ clubs, often with his hand-picked band, the Top Notes[1][3][9].

Vincent’s career is marked by his versatility as a musician, arranger, and bandleader. He became a go-to collaborator for New Orleans royalty such as Ernie K-Doe, King Floyd, Jean Knight, Jessie Hill, and Eddie Bo, both in the studio and on stage. His band not only headlined their own shows but also backed touring stars like Joe Tex, Z.Z. Hill, and Solomon Burke. Vincent’s style blends the deep grooves of New Orleans funk with elements of blues, R&B, and zydeco, reflecting the city’s musical melting pot. Over the years, he also established himself as a producer and label owner, founding Kolab Records in the 1980s to promote his own work and that of other local artists[1][3][6].

A staple at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival and a Louisiana Music Hall of Fame inductee, Vincent’s legacy lies in his ability to keep bands together, craft memorable arrangements, and mentor younger musicians. His influence extends beyond his recordings, as he helped shape the sound of New Orleans funk and inspired generations of local artists to pursue their own creative visions[2][3][4].
