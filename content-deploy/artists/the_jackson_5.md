## Biography
The Jackson 5 were five brothers from Gary, Indiana who became one of the most influential pop and R&B groups of the 1970s. The group was formed when their father, Joseph Jackson, discovered musical talent in his sons and began training them as musicians, with five-year-old Michael eventually becoming the lead singer. After performing in local talent shows and winning the famous Amateur Night competition at the Apollo Theatre in Harlem on August 13, 1967, the brothers caught the attention of Motown Records. Bobby Taylor of Bobby Taylor & The Vancouvers brought them to audition for Motown president Berry Gordy in July 1968, and Gordy was so impressed that he signed them to the label on March 11, 1969.

The Jackson 5 became an immediate phenomenon upon their Motown debut, achieving unprecedented success by becoming the first group to debut with four consecutive number-one hits on the Billboard Hot 100: "I Want You Back" (1969), "ABC," "The Love You Save," and "I'll Be There" (all 1970). Their distinctive sound combined youthful exuberance with sophisticated soul arrangements, while their striking visual presentation—featuring bold fashions, large Afros, and snappy choreography—made them cultural icons. Throughout the early 1970s, they continued to produce hits including "Dancing Machine," many written by the songwriting team known as "the Corporation." By 1975, the group had sold over 60 million records and earned two Grammy Award nominations.

The Jackson 5's tenure at Motown ended in 1975 when the brothers, frustrated by creative restrictions and inadequate royalties (earning only 2.8% of sales), announced their departure for Epic Records. Due to Motown's ownership of the name, they were forced to rebrand as The Jacksons. Jermaine Jackson remained at Motown, having married Berry Gordy's daughter, and was replaced by youngest brother Randy. Michael Jackson's departure from the group in December 1984 to pursue his solo career marked the beginning of the end, followed by Marlon's exit in 1985. By the time of their breakup, The Jackson 5/Jacksons had sold more than 100 million records worldwide, fundamentally shaping the sound and visual presentation of pop music.

## Fun Facts
- The Jackson 5 won the famous Amateur Night competition at the Apollo Theatre in Harlem on August 13, 1967, which led to Gladys Knight recommending them to Berry Gordy.
- While negotiations continued to get the Jacksons out of their Steeltown Records contract, the group performed at strip clubs to make extra income.
- The Jacksons' first album released under their new name after leaving Motown was technically their first gold album, despite having sold more than 10 million albums while at Motown.
- Michael Jackson was only five years old when he was recruited as the group's lead singer, and he was singled out by music critics as a 'prodigy' during the group's early years.
