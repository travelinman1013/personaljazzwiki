## Biography
Amina Claudine Myers (born March 21, 1942) is an American jazz pianist, organist, vocalist, composer, arranger, and educator whose work bridges free jazz, gospel, blues, and European concert music.[4][5] Born in Blackwell, Arkansas, she was raised by her great-aunt Emma Thomas and uncle Buford, and began formal piano lessons around age seven after discovering a deep attraction to music as a small child.[2][8] Her family moved to Dallas, Texas, in 1949, where she played for local churches, helped form a preteen gospel group, and began directing choirs—experiences that grounded her lifelong connection to sacred music and vocal arranging.[1][2] Returning to Arkansas in her teens, she co‑founded gospel and R&B groups such as The Gospel Four and The Royal Hearts, then went on to study music education and European concert music at Philander Smith College in Little Rock, where she played in the jazz band, directed the choir, and learned pipe organ.[1][2][5]

After graduating with a B.A. in Music Education, Myers moved to Chicago in 1963, taught in the public schools for six years, and immersed herself in the city’s avant‑garde jazz scene.[1][2][4] She joined the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians (AACM) in 1966, studying and performing with key figures such as Muhal Richard Abrams and Ajaramu, and began composing for big band and small ensembles.[2][3] During this period she worked with musicians including Sonny Stitt and Gene Ammons and was among the early performers in AACM concerts.[4] In the late 1960s she adopted the name “Amina” and steadily built a reputation as a powerful pianist, organist, and vocal improviser.[4][5] Relocating to New York City in 1976, she expanded into theater and off‑Broadway composition while continuing to record and tour; from 1978 she performed internationally with Lester Bowie’s Quintet and his New York Organ Ensemble, and later collaborated widely, including appearances with Charlie Haden’s Liberation Music Orchestra and saxophonist Archie Shepp.[1][2][3]

Myers’s musical style is distinguished by its synthesis of free jazz improvisation with gospel harmonies, blues feeling, and classical forms, often featuring her commanding Hammond B3 organ work, choral writing, and extended pieces for pipe organ, chorus, and chamber ensembles.[1][2][3] Large‑scale works such as “Interiors,” “Improvisational Suite for Chorus, Pipe Organ and Percussion,” and later commissions like “Sweet Mary Lou” (honoring Mary Lou Williams) and “I Will Not Fear the Unknown” for baritone Thomas Buckner exemplify her interest in blending sacred, concert, and improvising traditions.[1][2] She has also contributed to dance and interdisciplinary projects, including re‑creating and conducting the orchestral score for Helen Tamiris’s protest work “How Long Brethren” and developing multimedia pieces that integrate visual art, food, and performance.[1] Celebrated as both a performer and teacher, she has received grants from organizations such as the National Endowment for the Arts and Meet the Composer, has been honored by the Arkansas Black Hall of Fame and the Arkansas Jazz Hall of Fame, and continues to be recognized as a pioneering figure linking the innovations of the AACM to subsequent generations of jazz and creative music.[1][2]

## Fun Facts
- In the late 1960s she formally added the name "Amina" to her given name Claudine Myers, marking a new phase in her artistic and personal identity.[4]
- Her early college club engagement at the Safari Room ended quickly because her jazz repertoire was too limited at the time—a setback she has cited as motivation to deepen her studies.[4]
- Beyond jazz venues, she has composed and conducted large works for pipe organ and chorus, bringing improvisation into settings such as the Society for Ethical Culture in New York.[1][2]
- For the reconstruction of Helen Tamiris’s 1930s protest piece "How Long Brethren," Myers re‑created missing orchestral parts from archival fragments and then conducted full symphony orchestras and choirs in performance.[1]

Specific individual protégés are not named in the available sources, but her documented teaching in theory, composition, voice, piano, and organ, along with institutional recognition such as the 2021 Living Legacy Award, indicate a broad influence on students and peers.[1][2][5] (Influence reflected in later approaches to organ and voice within creative music; no specific derivative works are named in the sources.)
