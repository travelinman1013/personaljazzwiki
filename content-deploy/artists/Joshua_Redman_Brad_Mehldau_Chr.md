## Biography
Joshua Redman, Brad Mehldau, Christian McBride, and Brian Blade form a supergroup of modern jazz, each a virtuoso in their own right and together representing a high-water mark of contemporary jazz ensemble playing. Their collaboration first gained widespread attention with Redman's 1994 album 'MoodSwing,' which introduced this quartet as a formidable force, blending Redman's expressive saxophone, Mehldau's lyrical and harmonically adventurous piano, McBride's agile bass, and Blade's dynamic drumming. The album's all-original compositions and the group's remarkable interplay elevated not only Redman's profile but also established each member as a leading voice in jazz.[3][9]

After their initial collaboration, the members pursued highly successful individual careers. Redman, the son of legendary saxophonist Dewey Redman, became known for his inventive improvisation and genre-blurring projects. Mehldau, recognized for his fusion of jazz, classical, and pop idioms, formed the influential Brad Mehldau Trio. McBride, a Grammy-winning bassist, became a sought-after bandleader and educator, while Blade established himself as one of the most sensitive and creative drummers in jazz. The quartet reunited for the album 'RoundAgain' (2020) and 'LongGone' (2022), reaffirming their status as a premier jazz ensemble and showcasing their matured artistry and deep musical rapport.[2][7]

Their music is characterized by intricate interplay, melodic inventiveness, and a willingness to draw from a wide range of influences, including jazz standards, pop, and classical music. The legacy of this group lies in their ability to push the boundaries of jazz while honoring its traditions, inspiring a new generation of musicians and listeners alike.[3][9]
