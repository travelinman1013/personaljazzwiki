## Biography
Kyle Rowland is a blues harmonica player, singer, and bandleader from Sacramento, California, born on June 8, 1993[5]. He began his musical journey at the remarkably young age of 10, quickly establishing himself as a prodigious talent in the Sacramento blues scene[1][3]. Under the guidance of blues legends such as James Cotton, Lazy Lester, and Hubert Sumlin, Rowland absorbed not only the technical nuances of harmonica playing but also the stagecraft and business acumen essential to a professional music career[1]. His style is a vibrant mix of Chicago and Texas blues, seasoned with West Coast swing, mid-century soul, and funk, creating a sound that is both deeply traditional and refreshingly contemporary[1][2]. By 2024, his impact was recognized with induction into the Sacramento Blues Hall of Fame as its youngest member, and he reached the semifinals of the International Blues Challenge in both 2024 and 2025[1][2]. Rowland leads the band Rowland & Tumblin’, known for energetic live performances that have made them festival favorites across Northern California[1][2]. Despite his youth, Rowland has already carved out a significant legacy in the regional blues community, celebrated for his authenticity, technical skill, and emotional depth.
