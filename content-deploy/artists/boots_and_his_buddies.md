## Biography
Boots and His Buddies was a Southwestern swing‑era jazz band led by drummer and bandleader **Clifford “Boots” Douglas**, an American jazz musician born in Temple, Texas, probably on September 7, 1906 or 1908.[3][4] After early work as a drummer in Texas dance and territory bands, Douglas formed his own ensemble in San Antonio in the mid‑1930s, drawing on the strong Black dance‑band tradition of central and south Texas.[1][3] The band’s first recording session took place in 1935, and it was soon documenting its energetic, riff‑driven jazz for labels like Bluebird, contributing to the vibrant but often under‑documented Texas swing and jazz scene of the period.[1][3][6]

Active primarily between 1935 and 1938 on record, Boots and His Buddies toured regionally, playing dances and ballrooms across Texas and neighboring states, where they were known for a driving rhythm section anchored by Douglas’s drums and a sound that blended territory‑band swing, blues, and hot jazz.[3][4][6] Their recorded titles from 1935–1937, later collected on reissue sets, showcase tight ensemble riffing, bluesy vocals, and a propulsive beat that placed them stylistically alongside better‑known national swing bands while retaining a distinct Southwestern character.[4][5] Although the group never achieved the national fame of big‑city orchestras, its recordings have been preserved in discographical projects and reissues, and today Boots and His Buddies is recognized by jazz collectors and historians as an important example of a regional Texas jazz band that broadened the geographical map of American swing in the 1930s.[3][4][6]
