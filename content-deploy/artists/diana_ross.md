## Biography
Diana Ernestine Earle Ross, born March 26, 1944, is an American singer and actress known as the "Queen of Motown." She began her singing career in The Primettes, who recorded one single on Lupine Records in 1960 with Diana on lead vocals. The group later signed with Motown Records and became The Supremes, initially struggling with seven singles that failed to make chart impact, earning them the in-house nickname "no-hit Supremes." However, their fortunes changed dramatically in 1964 when "Where Did Our Love Go" reached number one, launching a remarkable run of 12 number-one pop singles on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, making them the best-charting female group in history and one of the world's best-selling girl groups of all time.

By 1967, the group underwent a reshuffle with Florence Ballard replaced by Cindy Birdsong, and was renamed "Diana Ross & the Supremes," establishing Ross as the focal point. She departed the group in 1970 to launch a highly successful solo career, releasing her eponymous debut album. Between 1972 and 1980, Ross recorded four top ten albums with her most successful being "Diana." As a solo artist, she achieved six number-one Billboard Hot 100 singles including "Ain't No Mountain High Enough," "Touch Me in the Morning," "Theme from Mahogany (Do You Know Where You're Going To)," "Love Hangover," "Upside Down," and "Endless Love," making her the female solo act with the most number-one songs in the United States at the time. She also found international success with songs like "I'm Coming Out," "Chain Reaction," and "If We Hold on Together."

Ross's career extended beyond music into film, most notably starring as Billie Holiday in the 1972 biographical film "Lady Sings the Blues," which earned her a Golden Globe for Best Newcomer and universal critical acclaim. After over 20 years with Motown, she left in 1981 for RCA Records, signing what was then music history's most expensive recording deal at $20 million for seven years with complete production control. She returned to Motown in 1988 as a part-owner and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame that same year as a member of the Supremes. Her silky soprano voice, combined with Motown's meticulous image cultivation, helped define the legendary Motown sound and aesthetic that influenced generations of artists.

## Fun Facts
- When Ross left Motown in 1981 after over 20 years with the label, she received only $250,000 as severance, but then signed with RCA Records for $20 million over seven years—the most expensive recording deal in music history at that time.
- Ross established her own production company called Anaid Productions, which is "Diana" spelled backwards, and began investing in real estate alongside her music career.
- The Supremes' final number-one hit, "Someday We'll Be Together" in 1969, is arguably Diana Ross's first solo release since neither of her fellow Supremes Mary Wilson and Cindy Birdsong appeared on the A-side, only recording vocals for the B-side "He's My Sunny Boy."
- The soundtrack album for "Lady Sings the Blues" went to number one on the Billboard 200 for two weeks and reportedly sold 300,000 copies during its first eight days of release in 1972, showcasing Ross's massive crossover appeal into film.
