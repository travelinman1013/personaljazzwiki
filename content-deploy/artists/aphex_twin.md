## Biography
Richard David James, known professionally as Aphex Twin, was born on 18 August 1971 in Limerick, Ireland, to Welsh parents, though he was raised in Cornwall, England. He inherited his name from a stillborn older brother, a family tragedy that influenced his mother's decision to reuse it. James began experimenting with music at age 14 using analog synthesizers, creating sounds reminiscent of acid house and techno before fully encountering those genres. By the late 1980s, he was DJing at free parties and clubs in southwest England, where he met key figures like Tom Middleton and Grant Wilson-Claridge, leading to his debut EP *Analogue Bubblebath* in 1991 on Mighty Force Records.[2][3]

James co-founded Rephlex Records in 1991 with Wilson-Claridge, establishing a platform for his experimental sounds and those of like-minded artists. His 1992 album *Selected Ambient Works 85–92* on Apollo Records brought critical acclaim, followed by a Warp Records deal yielding influential releases like *...I Care Because You Do* (1995), *Richard D. James Album* (1996), and singles 'Come to Daddy' and 'Windowlicker' (1997–1999) with videos by Chris Cunningham. His style blends IDM, ambient, techno, acid, jungle, and drill 'n' bass, often using custom analog gear early on before shifting to digital and computer-based production. Later works include *Drukqs* (2001), *Syro* (2014, Grammy winner), and *Collapse EP* (2018).[2][3][1]

Aphex Twin's legacy as a pioneering electronic artist endures through his vast output under numerous aliases (e.g., AFX, the Tuss), over 1,000 unreleased tracks, and innovations like synaesthesia-inspired composition and lucid dreaming for ideas. He has shaped IDM and influenced generations, with Rephlex championing 'braindance'—a term for his eclectic, intelligent electronic ethos.[2][3]

## Fun Facts
- James claims to have made music similar to acid house and techno years before hearing those genres, starting at age 14 as an escape from his sister's Jesus and Mary Chain albums.[3]
- He signed his debut record contract while tripping on acid backstage at a DJ gig, a pivotal moment coerced by promoters.[3]
- James has recorded over 1,000 unreleased tracks and uses synaesthesia and lucid dreaming to develop compositional ideas.[3]
- His alias 'the Tuss' is Cornish slang for 'erection,' and his involvement was speculated until confirmed in 2014.[3]
