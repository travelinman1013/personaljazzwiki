## Biography
The Dirty Dozen Brass Band was formed in 1977 in New Orleans, emerging from an outreach youth music program initiated by guitarist Danny Barker at Fairview Baptist Church. Initially, the band consisted of musicians who had played in the church's marching band, including Gregory Davis, Anthony Lacen, Charles Joseph, and Kevin Harris. They were later joined by Efrem Townes, Roger Lewis, Benny Jones, and Jenell Marshall. The band's early years were marked by a blend of traditional brass band music with modern jazz, R&B, and funk, creating a unique sound that would become known as a 'musical gumbo.' This innovative approach helped revitalize the brass band tradition in New Orleans and attracted a global audience. Over the years, the Dirty Dozen Brass Band has toured extensively across five continents and collaborated with artists such as Dr. John, Widespread Panic, and Norah Jones. Their legacy includes twelve studio albums and numerous live performances that have cemented their status as pioneers in American music. The band's sound has been pivotal in shaping the contemporary brass band genre, incorporating elements from bebop jazz and soul into their performances.

The Dirty Dozen Brass Band continues to perform with high energy, maintaining their position as a leading force in New Orleans music.
