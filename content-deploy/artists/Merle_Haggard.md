## Biography
Merle Ronald Haggard was born on April 6, 1937, in Oildale, California, near Bakersfield, to parents who had migrated from the Oklahoma Dust Bowl during the Depression era. His early life was marked by hardship and tragedy—his father, a railroad worker and musician, died of a stroke when Merle was just nine years old, an event that profoundly disrupted the young boy's life and set him on a troubled path. Growing up in a converted railroad boxcar alongside train tracks, Haggard became a chronic truant and serial runaway, hopping freight trains and engaging in petty crime including truancy, passing phony checks, and grand theft auto. Despite his rebellious nature and disdain for formal education, music became his salvation and silver lining. His mother had recognized his inherited musical talent early on, starting him on violin before he gravitated toward the fiddle and then the guitar at age twelve—an instrument that would give voice to this shy boy and eventually make him a legend.

Haggard's criminal record led to multiple incarcerations beginning in his early teens, including stays at the Fred C. Nelles School for Boys and Preston School of Industry, from which he frequently escaped. At age twenty, he was convicted for burglary and attempted escape from county jail, resulting in a 2½-year sentence at San Quentin prison (1957–1960), where he played in the prison's country band and witnessed Johnny Cash's legendary 1959 performance. After his release in 1960, Haggard worked briefly as a laborer before pursuing music full-time, playing at local Bakersfield clubs like the Lucky Spot. In 1962, he signed with Tally Records and released his debut single "Sing a Sad Song," which reached No. 19 on the country charts. By 1965, he had formed his backing band, The Strangers, and signed with Capitol Records, launching a career that would establish him as one of country music's greatest artists.

With 38 to 40 No. 1 hits and 250 original songs, Haggard became a country music legend whose work authentically reflected his difficult past. His most celebrated songs—including "I'm a Lonesome Fugitive" (1967), "Branded Man" (1967), "Mama Tried" (1968), "Hungry Eyes" (1969), and the crossover hit "Okie from Muskogee" (1969)—carried a somber, introspective quality that resonated with audiences and established him as a pioneer of outlaw country. The Strangers, his backing band, were voted Band of the Year by the Academy of Country Music Awards eight times between 1969 and 1987. Haggard was officially pardoned in 1972 by California Governor Ronald Reagan, a redemptive moment that symbolized his transformation from troubled youth to respected artist. He remained one of the most covered and influential country musicians of the late twentieth century until his death on April 6, 2016—exactly seventy-nine years after his birth.

## Fun Facts
- Haggard was not actually born in a boxcar as legend suggests, but rather in a Bakersfield, California hospital on April 6, 1937. His family lived in a converted railroad boxcar after settling in Oildale, a town outside Bakersfield.
- He was a chronic escape artist from juvenile detention facilities, frequently breaking out of the Fred C. Nelles School for Boys and Preston School of Industry, demonstrating the same rebellious spirit that would later define his music.
- Haggard's mother named him Merle after a musician friend of the family, and she predicted before his birth that music would be his birthright—a prophecy that proved remarkably accurate.
- He was officially pardoned in 1972 by California Governor Ronald Reagan, making his redemption from convicted felon to country music legend a remarkable real-life story that paralleled the themes in his songs.
