## Biography
L.T.D. (short for Love, Togetherness, and Devotion) is an American R&B and funk band formed in 1968 in Greensboro, North Carolina. The original members—Arthur 'Lorenzo' Carnegie, Jake Riley, Carle Wayne Vickers, Abraham 'Onion' Miller, and Jimmy 'J.D.' Davis—were seasoned musicians who had previously played together in the Fantastic Soul Men Orchestra, a group known for backing the legendary soul duo Sam & Dave. After relocating to New York City, the band expanded with the addition of Toby Wynn and, crucially, Jeffrey Osborne, who would become their iconic lead vocalist and drummer. The group later moved to Los Angeles, where more members joined, including Jeffrey's brother Billy Osborne, Celeste Cole, Henry E. Davis, and Robert Santiel. In 1974, L.T.D. signed with A&M Records and released their debut albums, 'Gittin' Down' and 'Love, Togetherness and Devotion.'

L.T.D.'s breakthrough came in 1976 with the hit single 'Love Ballad,' which topped the R&B charts and reached the pop Top 20. Their signature blend of lush horn arrangements, smooth harmonies, and soulful grooves defined the quiet storm and classic soul genres. The band's biggest commercial success arrived with 'Back in Love Again' in 1977, peaking at #4 on the Billboard Hot 100 and again topping the R&B chart. L.T.D. became known for energetic live performances, frequent television appearances, and their ability to blend funk, soul, and romantic balladry. Jeffrey Osborne's powerful vocals were central to their sound until his departure in 1980 to pursue a solo career. Although the group continued to record and tour with new members, they never matched their late-1970s peak. Nevertheless, L.T.D.'s influence endures, with their songs covered by major artists and sampled in contemporary music.
