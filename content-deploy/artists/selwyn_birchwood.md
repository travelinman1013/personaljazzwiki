## Biography
Selwyn Birchwood, born February 3, 1985, in Orlando, Florida, is a dynamic modern blues artist celebrated for his innovative approach to the genre[5]. Raised in a multicultural household—his father was a commercial pilot from Trinidad and his mother from the United Kingdom—Birchwood was exposed to a diverse range of musical influences early on[5]. His passion for blues ignited at age 18 after witnessing a live performance by Buddy Guy, which inspired him to pursue the genre with fervor[2]. While still a teenager, Birchwood joined the band of legendary bluesman Sonny Rhodes, who became a pivotal mentor and imparted invaluable lessons about authenticity and musicianship[5]. Birchwood balanced his musical ambitions with academics, earning an MBA from the University of Tampa, a testament to his discipline and drive[1][6].

Birchwood's career accelerated after forming The Selwyn Birchwood Band in 2010, assembling seasoned musicians drawn to his talent and vision[1]. His self-released debut, "FL Boy" (2011), helped the band gain recognition beyond Florida. In 2013, Birchwood won the International Blues Challenge in Memphis, which led to a contract with Alligator Records[1][2]. His debut album for the label, "Don't Call No Ambulance" (2014), garnered critical acclaim and multiple awards, including the Blues Music Award for Best New Artist Debut[1]. Subsequent releases, such as "Pick Your Poison" (2016), "Living In A Burning House" (2021), and "Exorcist" (2023), have further established Birchwood as a leading voice in contemporary blues, blending deep blues, psychedelic rock, funk, and Southern soul into what he calls "Electric Swamp Funkin' Blues"[1][3][4].

Birchwood's legacy is defined by his commitment to originality and his ability to push the boundaries of blues while honoring its traditions. His soulful vocals, blistering guitar work, and clever songwriting have earned praise from major publications and a devoted following. Birchwood continues to tour internationally, bringing his electrifying performances and visionary sound to audiences worldwide[1][4].
