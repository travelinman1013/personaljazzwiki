## Biography
Takuya Kuroda is a Japanese jazz trumpeter and arranger, born on February 21, 1980, in Ashiya, Hyōgo, Japan. He began his musical journey by joining his school’s big band and was inspired by his older brother, a trombonist, to pursue jazz. By his teenage years, Kuroda was performing in jazz clubs in Kobe and Osaka, developing his skills and musical voice. In 2003, he moved to the United States, initially attending Berklee College of Music in Boston before settling in Brooklyn, New York. He completed his studies at The New School’s College of Performing Arts, graduating in 2006 with a degree in jazz and contemporary music.

Kuroda quickly became an active figure in the New York jazz scene, performing with a diverse array of artists and ensembles, including Akoya Afrobeat and DJ Premier’s BADDER band. He is known for his distinctive sound that fuses soulful jazz, funk, post-bop, fusion, and hip hop influences. Kuroda’s close friendship and collaboration with vocalist José James proved pivotal; he contributed horn arrangements and performances to James’s albums and, in turn, James produced Kuroda’s 2014 Blue Note release, 'Rising Son.' Kuroda has released several albums as a leader, including 'Bitter and High,' 'Edge,' 'Six Aces,' 'Rising Son,' 'Zigzagger,' 'Fly Moon Die Soon,' and 'Midnight Crisp.'

Kuroda’s innovative approach and genre-blending style have earned him a reputation as a forward-thinking musician on the international jazz scene. His work bridges traditional jazz with contemporary sounds, making him a prominent figure in nu jazz and jazz funk circles. Through his recordings and collaborations, Kuroda continues to influence and inspire a new generation of jazz musicians.
