## Biography
Josh White (born May 25, 1973) is an American Christian musician, worship leader, and pastor known for his work in contemporary Christian music and the Seattle sound. Raised in a challenging family environment with an absent father, White found solace in music from a young age, beginning to sing and write songs at age 12. He was active in the Seattle music scene, performing with bands such as Marble, Medicate, and Man Ray, before embarking on a solo career in 1999. His early career saw both critical acclaim and disappointment, including a major label deal that ended abruptly, which ultimately led him to reevaluate his life and faith[1][5].

After moving to Portland, Oregon with his wife Darcy, White returned to his Christian roots and founded the band Telecast in 2002, blending Brit rock influences with worship music. As lead singer of Telecast, he released several albums and became a prominent figure in Christian alternative rock. White later became the founding pastor of Door of Hope, a church in Portland's Hawthorne District, where he continues to serve. His solo albums, including 'Achor' (2010) and 'Absolution' (2013), reflect a folk and bluegrass worship style inspired by the local culture and his church community[1][2][3].

White's legacy lies in his ability to bridge contemporary music styles with worship, fostering a revivalist spirit reminiscent of the Jesus Movement. His work as a pastor, songwriter, and recording artist has influenced worship music in the Pacific Northwest and beyond, with songs written specifically for his church and used in its services. He is also an author and continues to mentor young musicians and worship leaders, shaping the next generation of Christian artists[3][7].
