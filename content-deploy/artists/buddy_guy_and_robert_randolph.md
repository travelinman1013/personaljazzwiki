## Biography
Buddy Guy is a legendary Chicago blues guitarist and singer born George Guy Jr. in Lettsworth, Louisiana, on September 30, 1930. On September 25, 1957, he moved to Chicago, where he quickly established himself as a transformative figure in electric blues. After securing a residency at the 708 club, he met Muddy Waters, who became his mentor and provided crucial guidance early in his career. Guy recorded extensively as a sideman for Chess Records, working alongside blues giants including Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, Little Walter, and Sonny Boy Williamson, while also developing his own recording career. His most celebrated early partnership was with harmonica player Junior Wells, with whom he released seven albums, including the classic 1965 album Hoodoo Man Blues, before Wells' death in 1998.

Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Guy released twenty albums across various labels, though his commercial prominence waned during this period. His career experienced a major resurgence in 1991 with the album Damn Right I've Got The Blues, which featured collaborations with Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, and Mark Knopfler, reestablishing him as a major force in blues music. This was followed by Grammy-winning albums Feels Like Rain (1993) and Slippin' In (1994). His later work demonstrated remarkable versatility, incorporating soul classics and contemporary material alongside traditional blues. His 2005 album Bring 'Em In featured an impressive roster of guest musicians including Keith Richards, Carlos Santana, Tracy Chapman, John Mayer, and Robert Randolph, showcasing his enduring influence and collaborative spirit.

Buddy Guy's legacy extends far beyond his own recordings; he fundamentally influenced the development of modern blues and rock music. His innovative approach to the electric guitar inspired British rock pioneers including Eric Clapton and Jeff Beck, who famously learned that the Fender Stratocaster could be used to play blues after witnessing Guy's performances. His 2008 album Skin Deep continued this tradition of high-profile collaborations, featuring Eric Clapton, Derek Trucks, Susan Tedeschi, and Robert Randolph. Guy's career represents a crucial bridge between traditional Chicago blues and contemporary music, and his mentorship of younger musicians has ensured the continuation of blues traditions into the 21st century.

## Fun Facts
- Buddy Guy's first appearance at the 708 club in Chicago required him to follow Otis Rush, establishing him in one of the city's most competitive blues venues.
- Eric Clapton and Jeff Beck famously slept in a 'raggedy van' while in England and didn't realize the Fender Stratocaster could be used to play blues until they saw Buddy Guy perform, fundamentally changing their approach to guitar playing.
- Leonard Chess, owner of Chess Records, initially prevented Guy from replicating his wild live sound on recordings, a creative restriction Guy felt limited his artistic expression during his early recording career.
- Mick Jagger of the Rolling Stones personally invited Buddy Guy to perform on a Muddy Waters cover ('Champagne and Reefer'), recognizing Guy's authority as a blues master despite the Stones' already legendary status.
