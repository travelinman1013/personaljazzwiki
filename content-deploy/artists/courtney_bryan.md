## Biography
Courtney Bryan, born in 1982 or 1983 in New Orleans, Louisiana, began her musical journey early, composing a hymn about angels as a grade school student at St. Luke’s Episcopal Church, where she continues to serve as a church musician. She pursued formal education at Oberlin Conservatory (BM, 2004), Rutgers University (MM, 2007), and Columbia University (DMA, 2014, advised by composer George Lewis), followed by postdoctoral studies in African American Studies at Princeton University. Her music weaves together jazz, gospel, spirituals, classical, and experimental traditions, bridging sacred and secular realms while exploring human emotions, improvisation, and social issues through layered styles and subtle improvisational impulses.[1][2][3][4][5]

Bryan's career gained momentum with residencies including Mary Carr Patton Composer-in-Residence at the Jacksonville Symphony (2018-2020), Creative Partner with the Louisiana Philharmonic Orchestra (2020-2023), Composer-in-Residence at Opera Philadelphia (2022-2024), and current roles as composer-in-residence with the New Haven Symphony Orchestra and Albert and Linda Mintz Professor of Music at Tulane University's Newcomb College since 2016. Her works have premiered at prestigious venues like Carnegie Hall, Lincoln Center, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Walt Disney Concert Hall, and the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, performed by ensembles such as the London Sinfonietta, Chicago Sinfonietta, and International Contemporary Ensemble. Acclaim includes the 2023 MacArthur Fellowship, United States Artists Fellowship (2020), Rome Prize (2019-2020), and Herb Alpert Award (2018).[1][2][3][4]

As a Steinway Artist, Bryan has released two records and teaches workshops at institutions like Princeton, Harvard, and Berklee, designing programs for youth in improvisation and composition. Her oeuvre confronts political themes, foregrounds African American experiences, and challenges notation to capture improvisation's essence, establishing her as a panoramic force in contemporary music with growing legacy through residencies, fellowships, and global performances.[2][3][4][5]
