## Biography
The BBC Big Band has its roots in the earliest days of the BBC, originating from the BBC Dance Orchestra formed in 1928[1]. The modern incarnation of the BBC Big Band was established in 1964[2], evolving from this foundational dance orchestra into a professional big band ensemble. Barry Forgie joined the band in 1977 as arranger and composer, playing a significant role in shaping the band's sound and repertoire[2]. Over the past two decades, the BBC Big Band has maintained an active performance schedule, collaborating with numerous musical legends and continuing the big band tradition in contemporary music.

The BBC Big Band specializes in big band and swing music, drawing from the rich heritage of the swing era while maintaining modern relevance[3]. The ensemble is known for sophisticated arrangements and has performed extensively with major artists including Ray Charles, Tony Bennett, and George Benson[6]. The band has become particularly renowned for their interpretations of film music, especially James Bond themes, which they have performed in concert settings that educate and entertain audiences with historical context about the compositions[2]. As of 2026, the band remains active with a lineup that includes members such as Gordon Campbell and Kenny Hamilton[3].

- The band performed a tribute to Quincy Jones by playing the Austin Powers theme music, which is a spoof version of the James Bond formula[2]
