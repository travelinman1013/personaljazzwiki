## Biography
Lena Prima is an American jazz and cabaret vocalist, songwriter, and performer, best known as the youngest daughter of the legendary New Orleans-born entertainer Louis Prima and his fifth wife, singer Gia Maione[1][2]. Born in Las Vegas, Lena spent her childhood split between Las Vegas and the New Orleans/Covington area of Louisiana, deeply immersed in the music and showmanship of her father, whose larger-than-life persona and joyful performances left a lasting impression[1][2]. She often traveled with Louis on his road trips and joined him on stage, developing a love for performing early on. Her mother, a classically trained singer and Louis’s stage partner, taught Lena to play drums, an instrument she still performs with today[2]. Tragically, Louis Prima fell into a coma when Lena was 11 and passed away three years later, but his legacy continued to shape her artistic path[1][2].

Lena’s career began unconventionally: despite her mother’s objections, she started as a rock and heavy metal singer in her late teens, even forming the band Rough Angel and recording with platinum producer Geoff Workman (Journey, Queen, Motley Crüe)[1][2]. When the rock scene shifted in the early 1990s, she transitioned to performing with lounge and cover bands, honing her craft over two decades before launching her own show—a tribute to her father—which became the foundation of her current repertoire[1][2]. In 2011, inspired by Hurricane Katrina’s impact on New Orleans and a memorable performance at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, Lena moved back to her father’s hometown, where she has since become a staple of the local music scene, performing regularly at major festivals and maintaining a long residency at the Hotel Monteleone[1][2]. Her music—spanning jumping swing, old-school funk, and her rock roots—radiates joy, soul, and a deep reverence for her New Orleans heritage, earning her critical acclaim and a devoted following[1][4].
