## Biography
Phyllis Dillon, a highly influential Jamaican rocksteady and reggae singer, was born in Linstead, St. Catherine, Jamaica in 1944.  She attended Linstead Primary School and developed her musical talent early on, participating in talent contests.  Inspired by American singers Connie Francis, Patti Page, and Dionne Warwick, Dillon honed her skills before being discovered by Lynn Taitt, Duke Reid's session guitarist, during a performance with the group The Vulcans at the Glass Bucket Club in Kingston.  This pivotal moment launched her career in the vibrant Jamaican music scene.

Introduced to Treasure Isle studios by Tommy McCook, Dillon recorded her debut single, "Don't Stay Away," in late 1966.  This original composition, backed by Tommy McCook and the Supersonics, is considered a landmark recording in Jamaican music.  Subsequent recordings often featured covers of popular American songs, showcasing her versatility and vocal prowess.  Notable among these were covers by artists such as Bettye Swann, Perry Como, The Grass Roots, and Stephen Stills.  She also recorded original songs like "It's Rocking Time," which later inspired Alton Ellis's hit "Rocksteady," and collaborated with Ellis on duets such as "Why Did You Leave Me To Cry" and "Remember that Sunday,"  credited as 'Alton and Phyllis'.  Dillon's mastery of the rocksteady sound, a slower, more soulful style than ska, is evident in recordings like her 1967 rendition of "Perfidia."  Despite achieving success, she moved to New York in late 1967, balancing a career in banking with frequent trips back to Jamaica to continue recording for Duke Reid until 1971, culminating in an album titled *Living in Love*.

Following a period away from the music industry, Dillon experienced a career resurgence in 1991, spurred by an invitation to perform at the Oceanea Hotel in Kingston.  This led to renewed touring across the UK, Germany, and Japan, and a return to the recording studio with Lynn Taitt in 1998, coinciding with a renewed interest in ska music in the United States.  She remained active until succumbing to cancer in 2004.  Her significant contributions to Jamaican music were recognized posthumously with the Order of Distinction in 2009.  Dillon's legacy rests on her powerful vocals, her mastery of the rocksteady genre, and her enduring influence on subsequent generations of Jamaican singers.
