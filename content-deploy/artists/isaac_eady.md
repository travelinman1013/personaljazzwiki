## Biography
Isaac Eady is a Grammy-nominated multi-instrumentalist, singer, and songwriter born in Tullahoma, Tennessee, and later rooted in New Orleans. Raised in a musically rich family, Eady was immersed in music from an early age—his sense of rhythm was noted by family members when he was just two years old, and he quickly became the star of his family band, performing alongside his grandfather and uncles. This early exposure fostered a lifelong passion for music, especially the drums, which he describes as his heart and soul.[2][4]

After graduating high school, Eady moved to the Gulf Coast, picking up gigs and further developing his craft. His career took a significant leap in 2021 when he joined the Tedeschi Trucks Band as a drummer, performing and recording on major projects such as the 'I Am The Moon' album. Eady is also the leader of his own New Orleans-based ensemble, Third Moon, where he showcases his versatility across drums, bass, guitar, pedal steel, piano, and organ. His musical style is an evolving tapestry of psychedelic, funk, soul, and rock & roll, marked by virtuosic live performances and a deep sense of groove and collaboration.[1][3]

Eady's legacy is still unfolding, but he is already recognized for his dynamic musicianship and his ability to blend genres seamlessly. His journey from family bands in Tennessee to major stages like the Ryman Auditorium and collaborations with celebrated artists underscores his growing influence in contemporary soul, funk, and classic rock circles.[2][3]
