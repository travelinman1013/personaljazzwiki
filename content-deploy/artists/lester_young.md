## Biography
Lester Willis Young, born August 27, 1909 in Woodville, Mississippi, was raised in a musical family—his father was a music professor and his mother a piano teacher. He began performing as a child in his father's carnival-minstrel bands, learning drums, dancing, and eventually the saxophone. After early stints with local bands and groups such as the Oklahoma City Blue Devils, Young moved to Kansas City in the 1930s, a vibrant jazz hub, where his career began to flourish.

Young's breakthrough came in 1936 when he joined Count Basie's orchestra, where his light, melodic tenor saxophone style contrasted sharply with the dominant, robust approach of contemporaries like Coleman Hawkins. His solos on recordings such as 'Lester Leaps In' and 'Taxi War Dance' became jazz milestones, and his understated, 'cool' tone helped lay the groundwork for the cool jazz movement. Young was also a close collaborator with Billie Holiday, who gave him the nickname 'Prez' (President of Tenor Saxophonists), while he dubbed her 'Lady Day.'

Despite a successful career, Young faced personal and professional challenges, including a traumatic military draft experience during World War II that led to a court-martial and lasting emotional scars. In his later years, his playing took on a darker, more introspective tone, but his influence only grew. Young's innovative phrasing, relaxed swing, and unique sense of melody inspired generations of jazz musicians, making him one of the most influential tenor saxophonists in jazz history.
