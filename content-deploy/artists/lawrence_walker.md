## Biography
Lawrence Walker (September 1, 1907 – August 15, 1968) was a renowned Cajun accordionist, celebrated for his original compositions and dynamic performances. Born in Duson, Louisiana, into a musical family—his father Allen was a fiddle player—Walker began performing at age 13 with his father and brother Elton as part of The Walker Brothers Group. The family moved to Orange, Texas, where they recorded their first record in 1929 with Brunswick Records.

Walker’s career gained momentum after World War II, when he focused more intently on music and toured extensively with his band, The Wandering Aces. Known for his showmanship and technical skill on the Cajun accordion, Walker became a dominant figure in Cajun music during the 1950s, earning the title 'King of the Accordion Players.' His original songs, such as 'Reno Waltz,' 'Evangeline Waltz,' 'Bosco Stomp,' and 'Mamou Two Step,' became staples of the Cajun repertoire. Despite his musical success, Walker also worked as a rice farmer for much of his life. He passed away in Rayne, Louisiana, in 1968, but his influence endures, and he was posthumously inducted into the Cajun French Music Association Hall of Fame in 1997.
