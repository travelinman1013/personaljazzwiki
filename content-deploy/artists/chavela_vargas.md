## Biography
Chavela Vargas (born María Isabel Anita Carmen de Jesús Vargas Lizano on April 17, 1919, in San Joaquín de Flores, Costa Rica) was a Costa Rican-born singer who became an icon of Mexican music and queer culture.[1][5] After a difficult childhood marked by her parents’ divorce, illness (including poliomyelitis), and family discomfort with her masculine dress and behavior, she left Costa Rica around age 17 and settled in Mexico, where she lived for more than seventy years and eventually obtained Mexican nationality.[1][2][3] In Mexico City she survived doing odd jobs while singing in the streets and cantinas, gradually entering the bohemian nightlife scene of the 1940s and 1950s, particularly in Acapulco and Mexico City clubs.[1][2][5] 

By the late 1950s, Vargas had become a cult figure among artists and intellectuals for her stark, emotionally intense interpretations of rancheras—songs traditionally performed by men with full mariachi ensembles—which she stripped down to voice and guitar, delivering with ferocity, deep timbre, and prolonged silences.[1][5] She dressed in men’s clothing, smoked cigars, carried a gun onstage, wore a trademark red jorongo (poncho), and defiantly sang love songs originally written from men to women without changing pronouns, openly challenging gender norms and heteronormativity.[1][3][4] With the professional support of famed ranchera composer-singer José Alfredo Jiménez, she released her first album, “Noche Bohemia,” in 1961, the beginning of a discography of more than 80 recordings.[1][5][7] Her circle included prominent Mexican artists such as Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo, with whom she was close and about whom she later spoke of a romantic relationship, and she became a fixture of Mexico’s artistic and intellectual milieu.[1][5]

Heavy alcohol use led to a decline in her career, and she withdrew from public performance in the 1970s, effectively disappearing from the stage for more than a decade.[1][5] In 1991 she made a celebrated comeback at the Mexico City cabaret El Hábito, which reignited her career and introduced her to a new generation of listeners.[1] She went on to tour widely in Latin America, Europe, and the United States, singing at major venues and festivals, and in 2003 she debuted at Carnegie Hall at age 83, an appearance promoted by Spanish filmmaker Pedro Almodóvar, who used her songs in several of his films and became one of her most visible champions.[1] In her later years Vargas publicly acknowledged her lesbian identity, received numerous honors in Mexico and Spain, and was widely hailed as a groundbreaking figure for women, queer people, and Latin American song. She died on August 5, 2012, in Cuernavaca, Mexico, leaving a legacy as one of the most distinctive voices in ranchera and Latin folk music, and as a cultural symbol of defiance, emotional truth, and chosen Mexicanness.[1][5]

## Fun Facts
- Vargas routinely performed love songs originally written from men to women without changing the pronouns, a bold gesture in mid‑20th‑century Mexico that made her an early queer icon.[1][3][4]
- Her onstage persona included wearing men’s pants and a red jorongo, smoking cigars, and sometimes carrying a gun, reinforcing her reputation as a fearless, unconventional figure.[1][3][4][5]
- Despite being born in Costa Rica, she insisted she was profoundly Mexican and is often quoted as declaring that Mexicans are born wherever they “feel like it,” underlining her chosen national identity.[2]
- After disappearing from the stage in the 1970s due to alcoholism, she made a dramatic comeback in 1991 at a small Mexico City nightclub, eventually leading to an 83‑year‑old debut at Carnegie Hall in 2003.[1][5]

## Musical Connections

### Mentors/Influences
- [[josé_alfredo_jiménez|José Alfredo Jiménez]] - Legendary ranchera singer-songwriter who provided key professional support early in her recording career and helped introduce her to broader audiences. (Supported and associated with her debut album “Noche Bohemia” and her early ranchera repertoire.) [Late 1950s–1960s[1][3][6]]

### Key Collaborators
- [[josé_alfredo_jiménez|José Alfredo Jiménez]] - Friend and artistic ally within the ranchera world; his songs were central to her repertoire and performances. (Interpretations of his rancheras across albums beginning with “Noche Bohemia.”) [1960s–1970s[1][3][6]]
- [[pedro_almodóvar|Pedro Almodóvar]] - Spanish film director who championed her work internationally, used her songs in his films, and organized high-profile performances including Carnegie Hall. (Use of her recordings in several Almodóvar films; promotion of her 2003 Carnegie Hall debut.) [1990s–2000s[1]]
- [[diego_rivera|Diego Rivera]] - Part of her close circle of artists and intellectuals; their relationship anchored her in Mexico’s cultural vanguard, though not as a formal musical collaboration. (Social and artistic association in mid‑20th‑century Mexico City bohemia.) [1950s–1960s[5]]
- [[frida_kahlo|Frida Kahlo]] - Close friend and, according to multiple accounts, a romantic partner; their bond situated Vargas at the heart of Mexico’s artistic milieu. (Social and emotional influence rather than documented joint recordings.) [1940s–1950s[5]]

### Artists Influenced
- [[pedro_almodóvar|Pedro Almodóvar]] - Her emotionally raw style and queer defiance deeply shaped the tone and musical language of several of his films, which in turn amplified her global reach. (Repeated inclusion of her songs in Almodóvar’s film soundtracks, where her voice underscores themes of desire and loss.) [1990s–2000s[1]]
- [[latin_american_and_spanish_singersongwriters_general|Latin American and Spanish singer‑songwriters (general)]] - Her stripped‑down, voice‑and‑guitar ranchera style and open queer persona influenced later generations of Latin and Iberian artists exploring non‑traditional gender presentation and emotional minimalism in song. (Subsequent reinterpretations of ranchera and bolero in more intimate formats; adoption of her repertoire in tribute concerts and recordings.) [1990s–2010s (inferred from her late‑career revival and documented impact on queer and bohemian music scenes).[1][3][5]]
