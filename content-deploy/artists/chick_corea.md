## Biography
Armando Anthony "Chick" Corea was born on June 12, 1941, in Chelsea, Massachusetts. Raised in a musically rich environment—his father was a jazz trumpeter—Corea began piano lessons at age four and soon added drums, which influenced his percussive approach to the piano. His early exposure to jazz greats like Bud Powell and Dizzy Gillespie, as well as classical composers such as Mozart and Beethoven, shaped his eclectic musical sensibility[2][4][7].

Corea's professional career began in the early 1960s, playing with Latin jazz and jazz artists including Mongo Santamaria, Willie Bobo, Blue Mitchell, Herbie Mann, and Stan Getz. His breakthrough came as a member of Miles Davis's band, where he contributed to landmark albums such as "In a Silent Way" and "Bitches Brew," helping to pioneer jazz fusion[1][3][4]. Corea then formed influential groups like Return to Forever and the Elektric Band, blending jazz, rock, Latin, and classical elements. His compositions "Spain," "La Fiesta," and "Windows" became jazz standards, and his discography spans acoustic, electric, and symphonic works[1][2][3].

Throughout his five-decade career, Corea was known for his tireless creativity, technical virtuosity, and genre-defying collaborations. He won 27 Grammy Awards and was named an NEA Jazz Master. Corea's legacy endures through his innovative recordings, his influence on generations of jazz pianists, and his role in expanding the boundaries of jazz[1][3][4][6]. He passed away on February 9, 2021, in Tampa, Florida.
