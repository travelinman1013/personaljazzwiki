## Biography
Hiatus Kaiyote is an Australian neo-soul band that emerged from Melbourne in 2011, formed through a series of serendipitous encounters among four virtuosic musicians. The band's origin story began when bass player Paul Bender attended a solo performance by singer-songwriter Nai Palm at a small Melbourne club, where she performed with a distinctive pink nylon-stringed guitar. Inspired by her singular musical presence, Bender sought her out, and the two began collaborating on compositions that felt intuitive. They subsequently brought in multi-instrumentalists Perrin Moss (drums/percussion) and keyboardist Simon Mavin, with the band members sharing living spaces in Melbourne's bohemian Fitzroy neighborhood. From their first session together, the four musicians demonstrated an almost telepathic connection, creating what they describe as their brand of "future soul"—a fusion of classical soul influences from artists like Stevie Wonder and Aretha Franklin with contemporary electronic and experimental production techniques reminiscent of Flying Lotus.[1][2][3]

The band's debut album, *Tawk Tomahawk*, released in 2012, introduced their distinctive sound of authentic homemade grooves and poetic polyrhythms, earning critical acclaim and attracting influential industry attention. Their breakthrough came when musician Taylor McFerrin discovered them while they were touring in Australia, helping to amplify their profile internationally. The band achieved significant recognition when they became the first Australian act to receive a Grammy nomination in an R&B category for their song "Nakamarra," which features an indigenous Australian skin name and reflects their deep connection to their environment.[1][2][3] Their sophomore album, *Choose Your Weapon* (2015), solidified their reputation as masters of sonic innovation, featuring 18 tracks and interludes reminiscent of J Dilla's production style. The album was conceived during their worldwide touring and represented a more expansive and ambitious sonic palette than their debut.[2][3]

Following an exhausting six-year touring cycle after *Choose Your Weapon*, the band took time to regroup and create their third album, *Mood Valiant*, which further demonstrated their ability to navigate between funk, neo-soul, progressive rock, hip-hop, and Latin jazz. Throughout their career, Hiatus Kaiyote has maintained their identity as boundary-pushing musicians and bedroom producers who prioritize emotional connection and creativity alongside technical virtuosity. The band's music reflects their Australian origins while transcending geographical limitations, establishing them as one of the most innovative voices in contemporary soul music.[5][6]

## Fun Facts
- Nai Palm, the band's lead singer, worked as a fire dancer in Melbourne before focusing on music, and the band's first official performance took place at the Bohemian Masquerade Ball alongside sword swallowers, fire twirlers, and gypsy death core bands—a setting that perfectly suited their eclectic nature.[1]
- The band's name "Hiatus Kaiyote" came together fantastically over time, and the song "Nakamarra" (which earned them a Grammy nomination) features an indigenous Australian skin name that was given to a girlfriend of Nai Palm's, reflecting the band's deep connection to their environment and cultural heritage.[1][5]
- For a Miles Davis remix, the band collaborated with a 73-year-old South Indian flute player, exemplifying their ethos of finding creative threads rather than simply recreating what already exists.[5]
- The band's second album *Choose Your Weapon* was largely conceived and developed on stages worldwide during their touring, with the band documenting material that fans were already familiar with from live performances, representing a different creative process than their studio-born debut *Tawk Tomahawk*.[2]
