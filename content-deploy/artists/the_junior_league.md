## Biography
The Junior League is the musical project of New Orleans-based singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Joe Adragna. Originally from New York, Adragna began recording under the name The Junior League in the mid-2000s, crafting a distinctive blend of power pop, indie rock, and classic pop influences. His early musical development was shaped by a deep appreciation for melodic songwriting and the jangly guitar sounds of 1960s and 1970s pop, which he channeled into his own home recordings.

Over the years, Adragna has released multiple albums as The Junior League, often playing most of the instruments himself but occasionally enlisting a rotating cast of friends and collaborators. His music is characterized by catchy hooks, layered harmonies, and a DIY ethos, drawing comparisons to artists like Big Star, The Beatles, and Matthew Sweet. Despite operating largely as a solo act, The Junior League has built a loyal following in the New Orleans music scene and beyond, earning praise for both studio albums and energetic live performances.

The Junior League's legacy lies in its commitment to classic pop songwriting and independent production. Adragna's work has resonated with fans of power pop and indie pop, and his collaborative spirit has fostered connections with a variety of musicians in the genre. The project stands as a testament to the enduring appeal of melodic, guitar-driven pop music.
