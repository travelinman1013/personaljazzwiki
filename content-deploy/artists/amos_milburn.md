## Biography
Joseph Amos Milburn, born on April 1, 1927, in Houston, Texas, as one of thirteen children, displayed prodigious piano talent from age five, teaching himself tunes like 'Jingle Bells' after his family rented a piano and advancing by imitating juke joint music despite formal lessons.[1][2][3] At fifteen, he enlisted in the U.S. Navy in 1942, serving in the Pacific Theater where he earned thirteen battle stars and entertained troops before returning to Houston post-World War II to form a 16-piece band playing in local clubs.[1][2][3][4] In 1946, local fan Lola Cullum helped him record 'After Midnight,' securing a deal with Aladdin Records in Los Angeles, launching an eight-year partnership yielding over 75 sides amid the Central Avenue scene.[1][2][3]

Milburn's career peaked in the late 1940s and early 1950s with jump blues hits like 'Chicken Shack Boogie,' 'Bad, Bad Whiskey' (a 1950 R&B #1 sparking drinking-themed songs penned by Rudy Toombs), 'One Scotch, One Bourbon, One Beer,' and 'Let's Have a Party,' often arranged by saxophonist Maxwell Davis; his boogie-woogie piano, upbeat romps with humor and double entendres earned him *Billboard* R&B artist honors and *Down Beat* awards.[1][2][3] Transitioning from jazz to louder rhythm-driven styles, he toured extensively as a one-nighter staple before reforming his band in Houston in 1956; later Aladdin releases flopped amid label woes, and attempts with Ace, King, and a rare 1962 Motown remake album failed to revive his commercial success as rock shifted to teen markets.[1][2][3][4]

Suffering strokes from the late 1950s—leading to a leg amputation—Milburn's career waned; his final recording was on a 1972 Johnny Otis album where Otis played left-hand parts for the incapacitated pianist; he died in Houston on January 3, 1980, at age 52 from a third stroke, leaving a legacy as a post-WWII blues pioneer bridging to rock 'n' roll.[1][3][4]

## Fun Facts
- Milburn taught himself 'Jingle Bells' in less than a day at age five on a rented family piano, then advanced by eavesdropping on tavern and juke joint pianists.[1][3]
- Despite hits like 'Bad, Bad Whiskey' launching a string of boozy anthems, there is no evidence Milburn had a personal drinking problem.[1][2][4]
- He earned thirteen combat stars in the Navy at fifteen (lying about his age) while entertaining troops with piano in the Philippines.[2][3][4]
- His 1962 Motown album of hit remakes featured a young Stevie Wonder on harmonica, though it remains extremely rare today.[2]
