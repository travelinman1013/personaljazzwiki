## Biography
Pedro Guinu is a Brazilian musician, composer, and producer known for his dynamic fusion of Brazilian funk, funk pop, funk carioca, and brega funk. Raised in Vale do Mucuri, Minas Gerais, Pedro grew up in a musically rich environment, surrounded by professional musicians in his family. His early exposure to music came from his uncles, who were drummers and regularly rehearsed at his grandmother's house, immersing him in a blend of classic Brazilian and international sounds. This upbringing deeply influenced his affinity for Afro-Brazilian styles such as afoxé and ijexá.

Moving to Rio de Janeiro, Pedro established himself as an in-demand session musician, working with a range of prominent Brazilian artists across genres. He is primarily a keyboardist, adept at piano, Fender Rhodes, and various synthesizers, but also plays drums. Pedro's approach is largely self-taught, learning by ear and later supplementing his skills with targeted piano technique courses. His solo debut album 'Palagô,' released on Brooklyn-based label Razor-N-Tape, showcases his ability to blend live, organic Brazilian rhythms with contemporary funk and jazz influences, earning him recognition in both Brazilian and international music circles.

Pedro's career is marked by a collaborative spirit and a commitment to musical authenticity, contributing to projects that bridge traditional and modern sounds. His work with artists like Baco Exu do Blues, Planet Hemp, and Zé Bigode Orquestra highlights his versatility and influence within Brazil's evolving popular music scene.
