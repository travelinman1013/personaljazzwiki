## Biography
Wolfe Johns is a New Orleans–based blues artist and bandleader whose work is rooted in the city’s street‑performance tradition and classic American roots music.[2][6] The project began literally on the sidewalks of Faubourg Tremé, where Johns started playing outside his home during the COVID‑19 shutdowns, determined to keep live music alive at a time when nearly every venue in the Crescent City had gone silent.[2] As his neighborhood performances drew attention, he moved his regular sets to Royal Street in the French Quarter, building an audience among locals and visitors with an electrified, high‑energy blend of blues, R&B, jazz, and soul.[2]

From those street beginnings, Wolfe Johns evolved into a full‑fledged working band heard on stages across New Orleans and beyond, including appearances at events produced by the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Foundation.[2][5] Often working in a tight three‑piece configuration as the Wolfe Johns Blues Band, the group draws heavily on the city’s deep rhythm‑and‑blues lineage as well as earlier blues traditions dating back to the 1930s.[3] Their sets mix reimagined takes on standards by John Lee Hooker, Muddy Waters, Earl King, Johnny "Guitar" Watson, Sly Stone, and others with emotionally charged original material such as the release “Belly of the Beast,” showcasing Johns’s modern, personal spin on classic forms while staying firmly anchored in the New Orleans sound.[2][3][6]

## Fun Facts
- Wolfe Johns first gained attention by playing weekly outside his home in Faubourg Tremé during the COVID‑19 shutdowns, long before moving onto formal stages.[2]
- After starting in his neighborhood, he shifted his street shows to Royal Street in the French Quarter, performing there daily and effectively turning the tourist thoroughfare into his main stage.[2]
- The Wolfe Johns Blues Band typically works as a three‑piece group, yet draws on blues influences stretching back to the 1930s while still sounding contemporary.[3]
- His live sets often move seamlessly from reworked classics by artists like John Lee Hooker, Muddy Waters, Earl King, Johnny Guitar Watson, and Sly Stone to his own high‑energy original songs.[2]
