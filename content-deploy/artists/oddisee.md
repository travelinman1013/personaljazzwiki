## Biography
Oddisee (born Amir Mohamed el Khalifa) is a Sudanese‑American rapper, producer, and bandleader known for blending jazz, soul, and live instrumentation with sharp, observational lyricism. Born in Washington, D.C. to a Sudanese father from Omdurman and an African American mother from Southeast D.C., he grew up in Prince George’s County, Maryland, in a multicultural, working‑class environment that exposed him to Black American jazz traditions, go‑go, gospel, and Golden Age hip‑hop.[4][3][6] Living next door to Parliament‑Funkadelic bassist Gary Shider gave him early hands‑on experience in an analog studio, where he learned to play drums and keyboards by hand and developed a deep producer’s discipline long before he owned his own equipment.[1][4] These formative years forged a style rooted in groove, musicianship, and the everyday realities of Black life in and around D.C.

Oddisee first emerged in the early 2000s as part of the Low Budget Crew, working closely with peers like Kev Brown, Sean Born, and Kenn Starr on Maryland’s underground scene.[2][4] His big break came when he produced and appeared on “Musik Lounge” from DJ Jazzy Jeff’s 2002 album *The Magnificent*, after being brought into the Touch of Jazz orbit through Kev Brown’s production connections.[1][4] Following a brief, frustrating label stint with Halftooth Records, he became the flagship artist for the independent label Mello Music Group in 2008, helping define its sound through solo projects such as *Traveling Man* (2010), *Rock Creek Park* (2011), *Odd Seasons* (2011), *People Hear What They See* (2012), *The Good Fight* (2015), and *The Iceberg* (2017), as well as the acclaimed group album *In the Ruff* (2009) with Diamond District.[2][3][5] Over time he expanded from sample‑based boom‑bap into a touring live band setup (often billed as Oddisee & Good Compny), using rich arrangements and jazz‑rap sensibilities to tackle themes of work, race, faith, politics, and personal responsibility.[2]

By the mid‑2010s, Oddisee had become a veteran of the independent hip‑hop world, touring internationally while maintaining full creative control and ownership of his catalog.[2][5] His music is frequently cited for its balance of accessible grooves and complex subject matter, drawing heavily on Black American musical idioms, Sudanese rhythm and phrasing, and D.C.’s regional sound.[3][4][6] He has produced for or shared stages with acts such as The Roots, De La Soul, Little Brother, and Jazzy Jeff, and his work with Mello Music Group helped establish a viable model for artist‑run, boutique hip‑hop labels in the streaming era.[5][2] Though often labeled “underground,” Oddisee has rejected that tag, emphasizing that his primary goal has been to build a sustainable, independent career rather than chase mainstream validation, making him a touchstone for artists seeking autonomy and long‑term artistic growth.[1][2]

## Fun Facts
- Oddisee grew up down the road from Parliament‑Funkadelic bassist Gary Shider and had to play full drum and keyboard parts live for three minutes straight in Shider’s studio, which gave him a strong live‑musician feel even in his programmed beats.[1][4]
- He effectively proved his business case for doing music full‑time by slamming his first commercial check—from his appearance on DJ Jazzy Jeff’s *The Magnificent*—on the family kitchen table to convince his entrepreneurial father that music could be a real career.[5]
- His 2011 project *Rock Creek Park* is an instrumental love letter to a real D.C. park where he used to ride his bike, combining soul samples and live instrumentation as a soundtrack to the city.[2][3]
- Oddisee has described D.C. as a “gateway between north and south,” and he deliberately used Diamond District’s *In the Ruff* to challenge industry gatekeepers who doubted that Maryland and the D.C. area could produce authentic, classic hip‑hop.[2]

## Musical Connections

### Mentors/Influences
- [[gary_shider|Gary Shider]] - Next‑door neighbor and early musical mentor; taught him to hand‑play drums and keyboards in an analog studio and shaped his foundational approach to production. (Early, unreleased demo sessions and formative beat‑making practice rather than commercial releases.) [Mid–late 1990s (teen years)]
- [[older_american_cousins__black_american_jazz_and_golden_age_hiphop_traditions|Older American cousins / Black American jazz and Golden Age hip‑hop traditions]] - Family and cultural influences who introduced him to jazz and classic hip‑hop, forming the core of his musical taste and stylistic palette. (General stylistic foundation reflected across albums like *Rock Creek Park*, *People Hear What They See*, and *The Good Fight*.) [Childhood and adolescence]

### Key Collaborators
- [[kev_brown|Kev Brown]] - Low Budget Crew colleague who helped connect him to DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Touch of Jazz camp; frequent early collaborator in the Maryland/D.C. underground. (Collaborations across Low Budget releases and the mixtape *Foot In The Door* (mixed by Jazzy Jeff).) [Early–mid 2000s]
- [[sean_born|Sean Born]] - High‑school friend and fellow Low Budget Crew member; produced for Oddisee and co‑developed his early beat‑making through long studio sessions. (Low Budget family projects and early recordings preceding his wider debut.) [Late 1990s–2000s]
- [[yu_and_x.o._diamond_district|yU & X.O. (Diamond District)]] - Rap group partners in Diamond District, created to represent D.C./Maryland/Virginia hip‑hop with sample‑heavy boom‑bap and a regional drawl. (*In the Ruff* (2009) and subsequent Diamond District releases.) [Late 2000s–2010s]
- [[dj_jazzy_jeff|DJ Jazzy Jeff]] - Veteran producer who gave Oddisee his first major album placement and helped showcase him via Touch of Jazz connections. (Track “Musik Lounge” on *The Magnificent* (2002); Jazzy Jeff also mixed Oddisee’s mixtape *Foot In The Door*.) [Early–mid 2000s]
- [[mello_music_group_michael_tolle_and_label_roster|Mello Music Group (Michael Tolle and label roster)]] - Independent label relationship in which Oddisee served as flagship artist and frequent in‑house producer, collaborating across the label’s projects. (*Traveling Man*, *Rock Creek Park*, *People Hear What They See*, *The Good Fight*, *The Iceberg* and various MMG compilations.) [2008–2010s]
- [[good_compny_touring_live_band|Good Compny (touring live band)]] - His core live band, providing instrumentation on records and tours and influencing his drum programming, chord progressions, and arrangements. (Live versions of his catalog; studio contributions across albums post‑*Rock Creek Park* and especially around *The Good Fight* era.) [2010s–present]

### Artists Influenced
- [[independent_jazzrap_and_underground_hiphop_artists_general_cohort|Independent jazz‑rap and underground hip‑hop artists (general cohort)]] - Cited as a model for balancing live instrumentation, jazz influence, and independent business practices; his role as a flagship Mello Music Group artist and touring bandleader has provided a template for similarly minded MC‑producers. (Influence reflected broadly rather than in specific tribute projects; often referenced around albums like *Rock Creek Park* and *The Good Fight*.) [2010s–present]
