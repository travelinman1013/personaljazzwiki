## Biography
Yussef Dayes, Charlie Stacey, and Rocco Palladino form a dynamic trio at the forefront of the UK’s contemporary jazz scene. Yussef Dayes, born December 12, 1992, in South East London, was raised in a musically rich household, absorbing influences from his Jamaican father’s jazz and reggae records and his mother’s country and pop sensibilities. He began playing drums at age four and, by ten, was studying under fusion legend Billy Cobham, which laid the foundation for his genre-blending approach[4][6]. Dayes first gained recognition with United Vibrations and later as half of the acclaimed duo Yussef Kamaal, before embarking on solo projects and forming his trio with Stacey and Palladino[5][7].

Charlie Stacey, a gifted keyboardist, and Rocco Palladino, a versatile bassist, joined Dayes to create the Yussef Dayes Trio, known for their electrifying live performances and improvisational prowess. Their 2019 Copenhagen concert, immortalized in the live album "Welcome to the Hills," showcased their synergy and willingness to push musical boundaries[8]. The trio’s sound fuses jazz, hard bop, free jazz, and avant-garde elements, drawing from hip-hop, reggae, and electronica to create a modern, soulful tapestry. Their collaborative spirit is evident in both live and studio recordings, with each member contributing distinct musical voices.

Dayes’ solo album "Black Classical Music" (2023) further cemented his legacy, winning the Ivor Novello Award for Best Album in 2024 and earning praise for its expansive, genre-defying compositions[1]. The trio’s work is celebrated for its technical mastery, emotional depth, and innovative approach, positioning them as central figures in the ongoing evolution of UK jazz[2][9].
