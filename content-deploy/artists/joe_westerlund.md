## Biography
Joe Westerlund is an American percussionist, composer, and improviser, born in Eau Claire, Wisconsin and currently based in Durham, North Carolina. He began his musical journey as a child, playing with friends in bands that would later evolve into notable projects. Westerlund attended Bennington College, where he immersed himself in avant-garde jazz and classical music, studying percussion and improvisation with legendary figures such as Milford Graves, Anthony Coleman, and Kitty Brazelton. This formative period deeply shaped his approach to rhythm and composition, blending experimental techniques with a strong grounding in American roots music.[2][4]

Westerlund first gained recognition as a founding member of DeYarmond Edison, alongside Justin Vernon (Bon Iver), before forming the acclaimed folk-rock trio Megafaun. Megafaun toured extensively across the U.S. and Europe, earning praise for their adventurous spirit and creative vision. Westerlund's collaborative spirit led him to anchor acts like Watchhouse and The Dead Tongues, and to participate in projects such as Grandma Sparrow and Setting, an improvisational trio. In recent years, he has focused on solo work, releasing albums like 'Reveries in the Rift' (2020), 'Elegies for the Drift' (2023), and 'Curiosities from the Shift' (2025), which explore meditative, cinematic, and dance-oriented percussive textures.[1][3][4]

Westerlund's music is characterized by a deep curiosity for rhythm, especially the clave patterns found in Afro-Cuban and Latin jazz traditions. His compositions often blend experimental soundscapes with instinctual grooves, reflecting both joy and bittersweetness. Through his solo and collaborative projects, Westerlund has become a respected figure in contemporary experimental and folk music, known for his emotional depth, improvisational skill, and innovative approach to percussion.[1][4]

## Fun Facts
- Westerlund recorded the sound of an air conditioner sighing in time with his music and incorporated it into a track as a tribute to Japanese experimentalist Ai (OLAibi).[1]
- He spent extra days alone at Sylvan Esso's studio in North Carolina, refining his solo compositions after a bandmate from Setting fell ill.[1]
- Westerlund's solo album 'Curiosities from the Shift' was partly inspired by rhythmic sketches he created for Califone's Tim Rutili during the COVID lockdown, which ultimately became the foundation for the album.[1][4]
- He describes his latest solo work as 'dance music,' a departure from his previous meditative and cinematic styles, influenced by his deep study of the clave rhythm.[4]
