## Biography
Betty Davis (born Betty Gray Mabry on July 26, 1944, in Durham, North Carolina) was an American funk singer-songwriter, model, and pioneer of feminist funk who became one of the most groundbreaking yet underappreciated artists of the 1970s. Her early interest in music was cultivated by her grandmother's collection of blues albums, which they listened to regularly. After being raised in Pittsburgh, she moved to New York City in her late teens, where she immersed herself in the vibrant cultural and musical scene of the 1960s, quickly becoming a fixture in the underground music community. During this period, she honed her craft, influenced by the city's eclectic mix of jazz, rock, and funk, while also establishing herself as a songwriter by penning "Uptown" for the Chambers Brothers.

Davis's career as a solo artist began in earnest in 1973 when she signed with Just Sunshine Records, founded by Woodstock Festival promoter Michael Lang. Her self-titled debut album, released that year, shocked the industry with its explicit lyrics, aggressive sound, and innovative production techniques that showcased her complete creative control. She followed this with "They Say I'm Different" (1974) and "Nasty Gal" (1975), her most well-known work, establishing herself as a fearless artist unafraid to explore themes of sexuality, empowerment, and social commentary. Her gritty, powerful vocal style could shift from a whisper to a scream in seconds, and her music combined raw funk with rock and soul elements that were ahead of their time. Though initially rejected by mainstream radio stations that banned her music for being "too hot to handle," Davis's influence grew exponentially when hip-hop artists like Ice Cube, Talib Kweli, and Ludacris sampled her records in the late 1990s and early 2000s, introducing her to new generations of listeners. She passed away on February 9, 2022, in Homestead, Pennsylvania, leaving behind a legacy as a trailblazer who challenged gender norms and societal expectations through her unapologetic artistry.
