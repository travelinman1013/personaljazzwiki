## Biography
Kathy Kallick, born September 19, 1952 in Chicago, Illinois, is a highly respected American bluegrass singer, guitarist, songwriter, and bandleader whose career has spanned more than four decades. Raised in a musically supportive family, she began performing by singing harmony with her mother and was influenced early on by the vibrant Chicago folk scene, drawing inspiration from artists like John Prine, Steve Goodman, and Tom Dundee. After moving to California in the mid-1970s and earning a BFA from the San Francisco Art Institute, Kallick immersed herself in the West Coast acoustic music community, where she discovered bluegrass and began to develop her distinctive style blending traditional and contemporary roots music.[1][4][6][7]

Kallick co-founded the groundbreaking Good Ol' Persons in 1975, a band notable for its eclectic sound and for challenging gender norms in bluegrass by featuring women in prominent roles. Over 20 years, the group became a fixture of the California bluegrass scene, influencing countless musicians with their innovative approach. After the Good Ol' Persons, Kallick established herself as a solo artist and later formed the Kathy Kallick Band, whose members have included some of the top acoustic musicians in the country. Her career includes over 23 albums, a Grammy Award, two IBMA Awards, and a Lifetime Membership from the California Bluegrass Association. Kallick is celebrated for her soulful vocals, inventive songwriting, and commitment to both tradition and exploration within the bluegrass and Americana genres.[2][3][5][8]

Throughout her career, Kallick has also contributed to children's music, collaborated widely, and taught at workshops and festivals, cementing her legacy as one of the most influential figures in West Coast bluegrass. Her music continues to resonate with audiences for its emotional depth, technical virtuosity, and the sense of community it fosters.
