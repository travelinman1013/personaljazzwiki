## Biography
Oregon is an American jazz and world music group formed in 1970, originating from a musical friendship between Ralph Towner and Glen Moore, who met as students at the University of Oregon in 1960. Inspired by jazz legends like Bill Evans and Scott LaFaro, as well as Brazilian music, Towner and Moore developed a deep interest in improvisation and cross-cultural sounds. After studying in Europe and playing in New York’s vibrant jazz scene, they joined forces with Paul McCandless and Collin Walcott, both of whom brought expertise in world music and woodwinds. The group’s debut album, Music of Another Present Era, was released in 1972 and established Oregon as pioneers of acoustic fusion, blending jazz, classical chamber music, and global folk traditions. Their music is characterized by intricate compositions, collective improvisation, and a unique instrumentation that includes guitar, bass, oboe, bass clarinet, and a variety of percussion and ethnic instruments.

Oregon’s sound evolved over the decades, incorporating electric elements and new percussionists after the tragic death of Collin Walcott in 1984. The group continued to innovate, welcoming Indian percussionist Trilok Gurtu and later drummer Mark Walker, while maintaining their core acoustic identity. Their legacy lies in their ability to seamlessly merge diverse musical traditions, influencing generations of musicians and earning critical acclaim for their originality and artistry. Oregon remains active, with a catalog spanning over 30 albums and a reputation as one of the most adventurous and enduring groups in contemporary jazz.

- Collin Walcott, a sitar and tabla player, was also Ravi Shankar’s road manager and studied ethnomusicology at UCLA.
