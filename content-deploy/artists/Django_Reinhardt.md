## Biography
Django Reinhardt, born Jean Baptiste Reinhardt on January 23, 1910 in Liberchies, Belgium, was a Belgian-born Romani jazz guitarist and composer who lived most of his life in France[1][3][4]. Growing up in a family of Romani gypsies, Django was surrounded by amateur musicians and began playing the violin before switching to banjo and guitar[4]. At age 12, he received his first instrument, a six-string banjo-guitar, and quickly became a skilled, self-taught performer, playing on street corners and in cafes[2].

In 1928, Reinhardt suffered a devastating injury in a caravan fire, leaving his left hand severely burned and partially paralyzed[2][4]. Despite losing the use of two fingers, he painstakingly taught himself to play guitar again, developing a unique technique that allowed him to voice chords and execute dazzling solos with only his index and third fingers[2][4]. Inspired by jazz greats like Louis Armstrong, Reinhardt became entranced by the genre and soon mastered improvisation[4][6]. In 1934, he co-founded the Quintette du Hot Club de France with violinist Stéphane Grappelli, pioneering a new style that blended Gypsy heritage with swing jazz and featured the guitar as a lead instrument[1][3][6].

Reinhardt's career flourished as he toured Europe, recorded with American jazz legends such as Coleman Hawkins and Benny Carter, and even toured the United States with Duke Ellington's orchestra in 1946[1][2][3][6]. His compositions, including "Minor Swing," "Nuages," and "Djangology," became standards of gypsy jazz, and his melodic improvisations and technical innovations profoundly influenced jazz guitar[1][3][6]. Reinhardt died suddenly of a brain hemorrhage in Fontainebleau, France on May 16, 1953, but his legacy endures through annual Django festivals and the continued reverence of guitarists worldwide[1][4][6].
