## Biography
Eric Allan Dolphy Jr. was born on June 20, 1928, in Los Angeles, California, U.S., and emerged as one of the most innovative and virtuosic figures in jazz during the late 1950s and early 1960s[1][2]. He began his musical journey as a child, mastering clarinet, oboe, and alto saxophone, and later attended Los Angeles City College[1][4]. Dolphy’s early professional experience included playing in Roy Porter’s big band in the late 1940s, followed by a stint in a U.S. Army band and further study at the U.S. Naval School of Music[1][3]. After returning to Los Angeles, he played locally until gaining national recognition with the Chico Hamilton Quintet in 1958–59[1][3].

Dolphy’s move to New York in 1960 marked a turning point, leading to collaborations with jazz luminaries such as Charles Mingus, Booker Little, and John Coltrane[1][3]. His musical style was characterized by virtuosic improvisation, wide intervals, and a pioneering use of the flute and bass clarinet in jazz, instruments rarely featured as solo voices before him[1][2][3]. While rooted in bebop harmony, Dolphy’s approach was highly abstract, often approaching atonality, and his solos were marked by free association and expressive techniques that mimicked human and animal sounds[1][2][3]. His 1964 album *Out to Lunch!* is considered a landmark in avant-garde jazz, showcasing his radical harmonic concepts and organizational innovations[1][3][4]. Despite his short life—he died at age 36 in 1964 from complications of diabetes—Dolphy’s influence on free jazz and the expansion of jazz’s instrumental and expressive vocabulary remains profound[1][3][4].

## Fun Facts
- Eric Dolphy was one of the first jazz musicians to record unaccompanied horn solos, predating Anthony Braxton by several years[3].
- Despite his avant-garde reputation, Dolphy’s improvisations were often described as ecstatic and exuberant, in contrast to the more serious tone of many free jazz players[3].
- Dolphy’s use of the bass clarinet helped establish it as a solo instrument in jazz, and he was among the earliest significant jazz flute soloists[2][3].
- He died suddenly in Berlin in 1964 from complications of undiagnosed diabetes, cutting short a career that was just reaching its peak[1][3][5].
