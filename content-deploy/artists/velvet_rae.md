## Biography
Velvet Rae is a 19‑year‑old singer‑songwriter whose music blends modern blues, indie, and classic singer‑songwriter traditions into a sound she describes as having an “old soul.”[2] According to her official site, she has been singing “since before [she] could speak,” treating music as a lifelong companion rather than a late discovery.[2] Her work often pairs intimate, confessional lyrics with sparse, blues‑inflected arrangements, centering her distinctive, emotive voice.

Releasing music under the name Velvet Rae, she has issued a run of singles and EPs on streaming platforms, including tracks such as “Day Two Blues,” “Lonely Highway Blues,” “Better when i'm alone,” “Winter Dip,” “Palm tree whiskey,” and “Stealing the Moon,” which position her squarely in a modern blues‑leaning indie space.[1] As a young independent artist, she is building her career primarily through digital releases and social media performance clips, where her vocal tone and live delivery have attracted attention and word‑of‑mouth praise.[1][3] While it is too early to speak of a long‑term legacy in the historical sense, her early recordings and online presence suggest a developing artist committed to emotionally direct songwriting and a roots‑inspired, contemporary blues aesthetic.
