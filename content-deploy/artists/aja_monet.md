## Biography
Aja Monet Bacquie, born and raised in East New York, Brooklyn, New York City, began writing poetry at age 8, inspired by storytelling and typewriters. She performed her first poem in high school at Baruch College Campus High School, winning a talent show and founding the club SABA (Students Acknowledging Black Achievements). Involved with Urban Word NYC, she attended Brave New Voices at 17, which politicized her, and at 19 became the youngest and last female Nuyorican Poets Café Grand Slam Champion in 2007. A graduate of Sarah Lawrence College (BA) and the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (MFA), Monet's early career blended poetry with activism, performing globally and speaking at events like the Women's March on Washington.
