## Biography
Parlet was an American female funk group formed in Detroit, Michigan in 1978 as a spin-off from the legendary Parliament-Funkadelic collective. The group was conceived by George Clinton, who sought to create a female counterpart to the P-Funk sound, drawing on the talents of veteran background vocalists Mallia Franklin, Jeanette Washington, and Debbie Wright. These women had already made their mark as the first female members of Parliament-Funkadelic, contributing vocals to both Parliament and Funkadelic recordings in the mid-1970s.

Parlet debuted with the album 'Pleasure Principle' in 1978, followed by 'Invasion of the Booty Snatchers' (1979) and 'Play Me or Trade Me' (1980). Their music was characterized by infectious funk grooves, soulful harmonies, and the signature P-Funk blend of humor and social commentary. Despite frequent lineup changes—Shirley Hayden and Janice Evans joined later—the group maintained a strong presence within the P-Funk universe, touring with the collective and contributing to its expansive sound. Parlet disbanded in 1980, but their brief run left a lasting impression on the funk genre, highlighting the essential role of women in the P-Funk movement.
