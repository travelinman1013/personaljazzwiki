## Biography
Matt Andersen is a Canadian blues guitarist and singer-songwriter known for his powerful, soul-drenched voice and dynamic guitar work. Born and raised in the small community of Perth-Andover, New Brunswick, he grew up in a blue-collar environment that deeply shaped the themes of hard work, struggle, and resilience in his songs.[1][4][6] He began his professional music career in 2002 with the local band Flat Top before striking out on his own, quickly earning a reputation as one of Canada’s hardest-working touring artists, often logging around 200 shows a year across Canada, the United States, Europe, and Australia.[1][2][3] 

Andersen released his solo debut, *Second Time Around*, in 2007, followed by *Something in Between* (2008) and *Piggyback* (2009), the latter a full collaborative album with harmonica player Mike Stevens.[1][2] A live album (*Live from the Phoenix Theatre*) and the holiday collection *Christmas Time* further showcased his ability to command a room with just voice and guitar.[2] In 2011 he recorded *Coal Mining Blues* at Levon Helm Studios with producer Colin Linden, highlighting his narrative-driven writing and blend of blues and folk.[4] Subsequent releases such as *Weightless* (2014) and *Honest Man* (2016) expanded his sound into roots rock and Americana, leading to a Juno nomination for Roots & Traditional Album of the Year and multiple Maple Blues Awards, European Blues Awards, and other honors.[1][2][3] 

Musically, Andersen’s style fuses traditional and modern blues with folk, roots rock, and soul, often described as an “earthy blend of blue-collar folk, electric blues, and roots rock” anchored by his commanding stage presence and emotional storytelling.[2][3][4] He has shared stages and tours with blues and rock luminaries including Bo Diddley, Buddy Guy, Gregg Allman, Tedeschi Trucks Band, Randy Bachman, Little Feat, Jonny Lang, Serena Ryder, and others, cementing his standing in the contemporary blues world.[1][3] His relentless touring, acclaimed recordings, and high-profile awards—such as being the first Canadian to win the International Blues Challenge solo/duo category in Memphis—have made him a key figure in modern blues, known for bringing deeply personal, narrative songs to audiences around the globe.[1][3][7]
