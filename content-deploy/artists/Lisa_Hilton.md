## Biography
Lisa Kristine Hilton is an acclaimed American jazz pianist, composer, producer, and bandleader, born in San Luis Obispo on California’s central coast. She began her musical journey at age six, teaching herself piano with a colored keyboard guide and composing simple songs before moving on to formal classical and twentieth-century music studies. Inspired by her great-uncle, Dutch pianist Willem Bloemendaal, and deeply affected by early exposure to blues and jazz—especially after seeing Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee in concert—Hilton’s formative years were marked by both self-driven creativity and structured learning. 

After initially setting music aside to pursue a degree in art in San Francisco, Hilton’s passion for music was reignited in 1997, thanks to encouragement from her Malibu neighbor, Grammy-winning producer David Foster. She resumed studies in theory and composition at UCLA with Charles Bernstein and quickly established herself as a prolific recording artist, producing nearly one album per year since her debut, 'Seduction' (1997). Hilton has collaborated with leading jazz musicians such as Antonio Sánchez, Larry Grenadier, Christian McBride, Luques Curtis, J. D. Allen, Rudy Royston, Igmar Thomas, and Sean Jones, and worked closely with legendary engineer Al Schmitt until his passing in 2021. Her albums regularly top jazz charts and have garnered millions of streams worldwide.

Hilton’s musical style is characterized by a blend of jazz and blues with elements of minimalism, classical, and avant-garde music. Critics often note her 'deeply expressive style' and 'appealing impressionism,' drawing comparisons to Bill Evans, Dave Brubeck, and Brad Mehldau. Her compositions are informed by her background in visual art, as she describes 'painting' with harmonies and 'sculpting' with rhythm. Hilton’s legacy is that of a modern jazz innovator, bridging American jazz traditions with contemporary influences and a unique artistic vision.
