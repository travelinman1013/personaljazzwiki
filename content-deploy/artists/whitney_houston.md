## Biography
Whitney Houston was born on August 9, 1963, in Newark, New Jersey, into a family deeply rooted in music. Her mother, Cissy Houston, was a renowned gospel singer, and her cousin was the legendary Aretha Franklin. Whitney began singing in her church choir at a young age, which laid the foundation for her powerful vocal technique. She was signed to Arista Records in 1983 by Clive Davis, launching her career with her self-titled debut album in 1985. The album was a massive success, producing three consecutive number-one singles and setting a record as the best-selling debut album by a solo artist. Houston's second album, 'Whitney' (1987), made history as the first album by a female artist to debut at number one on the Billboard 200, and she became the only artist to achieve seven consecutive number-one singles. Her musical style blended pop, R&B, and gospel, marked by her soaring vocals and emotive delivery.

Houston's career expanded into acting with her role in 'The Bodyguard' (1992), which featured her iconic rendition of 'I Will Always Love You'—the best-selling single by a female artist in history. She continued to release successful albums and soundtracks, including 'Waiting to Exhale' and 'The Preacher's Wife'. Over her career, she sold over 200 million records worldwide, won numerous awards, and set multiple chart records. Whitney Houston's legacy endures as one of the greatest vocalists of all time, influencing generations of artists and leaving an indelible mark on popular music.
