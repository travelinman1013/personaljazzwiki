## Biography
Preston Frank, born in 1947 in Oberlin, Louisiana, of Louisiana Creole ancestry, grew up in Soileau, Louisiana, in a musical family spanning four generations. His great-grandfather Joseph Frank Jr. played accordion, his great-great-grandfather Joseph Frank Sr. played fiddle with Dennis McGee, and his father Paul Frank played guitar with fiddler Canray Fontenot. Raised farming cotton while his family performed at house dances, young Preston was introduced to live music by his father and uncle Carlton Frank, a fiddler. He taught himself accordion by listening to records after buying a Hohner diatonic model from a Kinder drugstore, with some guidance from his father.[1][2][4]

In 1977, Frank formed The Preston Frank Soileau Band (later the Frank Family Band) with uncles Carlton on fiddle and Hampton on guitar, and brothers Charles Prudhomme on guitar and 'Slim' Prudhomme on bass. They recorded singles and the LP Zydeco Vol. 2 for Arhoolie Records in 1981-1985, including tracks like 'Shake What You Got' and 'Swallow Special'—the latter referencing his hometown Soileau. Additional albums followed on Lanor Records through 1991, such as one produced by Lee Lavergne. Working shifts at a plywood plant limited his touring, but he mentored his son Keith Frank, who took over leadership while incorporating Preston's traditional zydeco style. The band, known for zydeco and Creole music, reunited for events like a 2000 Liberty Theater performance and released Seventy-Five in 2023 for Preston's 75th birthday on Soulwood Records.[1][2][3][6]

Preston Frank remains a vital preserver of traditional zydeco and Creole French music, described as one of the last living links to these roots. He continues occasional performances, including at the Acadiana Center for the Arts in 2023, balancing his legacy with family involvement across five generations.[1][2][5][6]
