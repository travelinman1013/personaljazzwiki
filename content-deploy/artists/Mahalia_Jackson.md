## Biography
Mahalia Jackson (October 26, 1911 – January 27, 1972) was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, to Charity Clark and Johnny Jackson, growing up in the Carrollton neighborhood under the strict religious guidance of her Aunt Duke. Raised in a devout Christian household, she began singing at age 4 at Mount Moriah Baptist Church, though she was forbidden from listening to secular music. Despite these restrictions, she was secretly influenced by the blues recordings of Bessie Smith and Ma Rainey, as well as the jazz sounds emerging from New Orleans. At 16, she moved to Chicago with family members, where she joined the choir at Greater Salem Baptist Church and truly found her voice.

Jackson's career took off in Chicago, where she worked various jobs including as a laundress, beautician, and flower shop employee while building her reputation as a gospel singer. She joined The Johnson Gospel Singers and performed throughout the city, eventually catching the attention of gospel composer Thomas Dorsey, who asked her to record his songs including what became her signature piece, 'Take My Hand, Precious Lord.' Her 1947 recording of 'Move On Up a Little Higher' became a major hit, establishing her as gospel music's first superstar and leading to international acclaim.

Known as the 'Queen of Gospel,' Jackson revolutionized the genre by introducing elements of jazz and blues into her performances, infusing gospel with unprecedented sensuality and freedom while maintaining her religious convictions. Her singularly expressive contralto voice and dynamic performance style influenced generations of both sacred and secular singers. She became the first Black gospel artist inducted into the GMA Hall of Fame in 1978 and the first gospel artist to win a Grammy Award. Jackson remained true to her religious mission throughout her career, refusing to perform secular material or appear in nightclubs, and played a significant role in the Civil Rights Movement, singing at the 1963 March on Washington at Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s request.

## Fun Facts
- She was the first Black gospel artist inducted into the GMA Hall of Fame and the first gospel artist ever to win a Grammy Award
- Despite her strict religious upbringing, she secretly listened to blues recordings, particularly those of Bessie Smith, saying 'Bessie was my favorite, but I never let people know I listened to her'
- She added an 'i' to her first name when she began singing professionally, changing from 'Mahala' to 'Mahalia'
- Even after achieving mainstream success, she commented that 'The Baptists still watch me like a hawk, now that I'm mixed up in show business'
