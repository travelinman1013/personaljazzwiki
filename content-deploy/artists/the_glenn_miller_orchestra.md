## Biography
Alton Glenn Miller was born on March 1, 1904, in Clarinda, Iowa, and developed an early passion for music, taking up the trombone in high school before dropping out of college to pursue a professional career. He played with bands like Ben Pollack's in Los Angeles, freelanced as a trombonist and arranger in New York, served as musical director for Tommy Dorsey in 1934, and arranged for Ray Noble, shaping his distinctive clarinet-led sound. After initial struggles, including failed orchestras in 1937, Miller formed his breakthrough Glenn Miller Orchestra in March 1938, featuring key members like Tex Beneke, Marion Hutton, Ray Eberle, Paul Tanner, and Hal McIntyre.[1][2][4]

The band's signature style—clarinet melody doubled by tenor saxophone an octave lower, with harmonic saxophone support—propelled them to massive success starting with their 1939 radio broadcasts from Glen Island Casino, yielding 17 Top 10 hits like 'Moonlight Serenade,' 'Sunrise Serenade,' and 'Chattanooga Choo Choo,' the first gold record awarded. They starred in films 'Sun Valley Serenade' and 'Orchestra Wives,' dominating swing until Miller disbanded the civilian group in 1942 amid World War II draft pressures. Commissioned as a captain in the Army Air Force, he formed the Glenn Miller Army Air Force Band, performing for troops in England until his disappearance in a plane crash over the English Channel on December 15, 1944.[1][2][5][6]

Miller's legacy endures as the premier swing band of the era, symbolizing WWII morale with his unique 'Glenn Miller sound,' commercially unmatched with hits topping charts and breaking attendance records. The orchestra continues under successors, with Ray Anthony as the last surviving original member as of 2025, influencing big band revival and remaining a dance and nostalgia icon.[2][3][6]
