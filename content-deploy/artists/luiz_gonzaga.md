## Biography
Luiz Gonzaga do Nascimento Sr. was born on December 13, 1912, in Exu, in Brazil’s semi‑arid northeastern state of Pernambuco, the son of a small farmer and accordion player.[1][2][8] From childhood he learned and performed accordion with his father at local parties and religious festivities, later serving in the army where he also played cornet before settling in Rio de Janeiro after his discharge in the late 1930s.[1][2] In Rio he earned a living playing in bars and on the streets until he discovered that northeastern migrants longed for the music of home, prompting him to focus on regional genres such as xaxado, baião, chamego, and coco.[1][2] His breakthrough came when he performed the chamego “Vira e Mexe” on Ary Barroso’s radio talent show, receiving the top score and quickly becoming a radio regular and recording artist for RCA.[1][2]

During the 1940s and 1950s Gonzaga emerged as the central architect of modern northeastern popular music, popularizing the baião rhythm nationwide and helping crystallize what would become known as forró.[2][3][4] He developed the classic **forró trio** format—accordion, zabumba drum, and triangle—creating one of the earliest small pop ensembles in Western popular music and taking a rurally rooted sound into mass culture.[1][2][4] By the mid‑1940s he had adopted iconic stage costumes based on northeastern cowboy (vaqueiro) attire, and he increasingly sang his own material, culminating in classics such as “Asa Branca” (1947, with Humberto Teixeira), “Vozes da Seca,” and “O Xote das Meninas,” which poetically depicted drought, migration, and everyday sertão life.[1][2][3] Although his visibility in big cities waned in the 1960s with the rise of bossa nova and iê‑iê‑iê, he remained a major live draw in the countryside and was “rediscovered” in the 1970s–80s by younger MPB artists who recorded his songs, leading to renewed acclaim, the prestigious Shell Prize for Brazilian Popular Music in 1984, and honors such as the Luiz Gonzaga Dam named after him.[1][2][4][8]

Gonzaga’s musical style fused Afro‑Brazilian, Indigenous, and European elements into a distinctive, syncopated accordion music that was at once danceable and deeply tied to northeastern identity.[2][4] His pioneering forró and baião recordings moved from the hyperactive, accordion‑driven sound of the 1940s toward more melodic and nuanced arrangements over time, but always retained strong rhythmic drive and memorable hooks.[3][4] He died on August 2, 1989, in Recife, Pernambuco, yet is widely regarded as “O Rei do Baião” (The King of Baião) and one of the most influential figures in Brazilian popular music of the twentieth century, credited with bringing the “rich universe” of northeastern genres to a national audience and inspiring generations of major Brazilian artists.[1][2][4][8]

## Fun Facts
- Gonzaga was among the first Brazilian popular artists to build a whole stage persona around northeastern vaqueiro (cowboy) costumes, which he began wearing in 1943 and kept as a visual trademark.[1][2]
- His classic forró trio—accordion, zabumba drum, and triangle—has been described as one of the Western world’s earliest small pop ensembles, predating the standard rock band format popularized in the 1960s.[2][4]
- The song “Asa Branca,” co‑written with Humberto Teixeira and recorded in 1947, became one of Brazil’s most covered songs and an unofficial anthem of the drought‑stricken northeastern sertão.[1][2][3]
- In 1984 Gonzaga received the prestigious Shell Prize for Brazilian Popular Music, following legends Pixinguinha, Antônio Carlos Jobim, and Dorival Caymmi, and later even had a major Brazilian dam named in his honor (the Luiz Gonzaga Dam).[2]
