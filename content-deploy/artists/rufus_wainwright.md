## Biography
Rufus Wainwright is a New York-born, Montreal-raised singer-songwriter celebrated for his lush, theatrical pop and sophisticated songwriting. Born on July 22, 1973, into a highly musical family—his father is Loudon Wainwright III and his mother was Kate McGarrigle—he began playing piano at age six and joined the family ensemble in his early teens. By age 14, he had already received a Genie Award nomination for Best Original Song for his contribution to the film 'Tommy Tricker and the Stamp Traveller.'

Wainwright's career took off in the late 1990s after he signed with DreamWorks Records, releasing his acclaimed self-titled debut album in 1998. His follow-up, 'Poses' (2001), solidified his reputation for blending classical, pop, and cabaret influences, earning him a Juno Award and critical acclaim. Over the next two decades, he released a string of ambitious albums, including the double set 'Want One' and 'Want Two,' the operatic 'Release the Stars,' and the Grammy-nominated 'Unfollow the Rules.' Wainwright is also known for his ventures into classical music, notably composing the operas 'Prima Donna' and 'Hadrian,' as well as orchestral works such as 'Five Shakespeare Sonnets.'

Wainwright's musical style is characterized by his expressive tenor voice, ornate arrangements, and a penchant for theatricality. He is recognized as a trailblazer for LGBTQ+ artists and has left a significant legacy in both pop and classical music, inspiring a new generation of singer-songwriters with his genre-defying artistry and openness about his personal life.
