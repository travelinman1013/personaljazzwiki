## Biography
Barry White, born Barry Eugene Carter on September 12, 1944, in Galveston, Texas, was raised in the Watts neighborhood of South Central Los Angeles. Exposed early to his mother’s classical music records, he taught himself piano and began singing in church. White’s adolescence was marked by hardship, including a brief incarceration at age 16 for theft, during which hearing Elvis Presley’s 'It’s Now or Never' inspired him to pursue a career in music[1][2][3][5].

White started in the music industry during the 1960s as a session musician, songwriter, and producer, working with artists like Felice Taylor and Viola Wills. His breakthrough came in the early 1970s as the creative force behind the girl group Love Unlimited and later The Love Unlimited Orchestra, which produced the instrumental hit 'Love’s Theme.' Reluctantly stepping into the spotlight as a solo artist, White’s deep, resonant voice and lush orchestral arrangements defined a string of chart-topping hits such as 'Can’t Get Enough of Your Love, Babe' and 'You’re the First, the Last, My Everything.'[1][2][3][4]

White’s signature blend of disco, soul, and romantic balladry made him an icon of the 'quiet storm' and 'classic soul' genres. His influence extended beyond his own recordings, shaping the sound of 1970s R&B and disco. Despite a career lull in the 1980s, he experienced a resurgence in the 1990s, remaining a beloved figure until his death in Los Angeles on July 4, 2003. White’s legacy endures through his timeless music, distinctive voice, and enduring impact on popular music[1][3][4].
