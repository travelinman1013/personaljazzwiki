## Biography
Cimafunk, born Erik Alejandro Iglesias Rodríguez in 1989 in Pinar del Río, Cuba, is a groundbreaking Afro-Cuban artist whose music fuses funk, soul, hip hop, and traditional Cuban rhythms. After moving to Havana in 2010, he immersed himself in the city’s vibrant music scene, initially working odd jobs before joining the influential collective Interactivo, led by Roberto Carcassés. His stage name, Cimafunk, is a tribute to his heritage as a descendant of 'cimarrones'—escaped African slaves in Cuba—and his deep connection to funk music. 

Cimafunk’s career skyrocketed with the release of his debut album 'Terapia' in 2017, and especially the hit single 'Me Voy,' which made him a household name in Cuba and earned him major accolades, including 'Artist of the Year' by Vistar Magazine. His sound is celebrated for its electrifying blend of Afro-Cuban rhythms, the five-beat clave, and the influence of black showmen like James Brown and Fela Kuti. His sophomore album, 'El Alimento' (2021), received international acclaim, ranking high on year-end lists by Rolling Stone and NPR, and earning a Grammy nomination. 

Cimafunk is also known for his cross-cultural collaborations, notably with New Orleans musicians. His 2020 EP 'Cun Cun Prá' features the track 'Caliente' with The Soul Rebels and Tarriona 'Tank' Ball of Tank and the Bangas, exemplifying his commitment to bridging Cuban and African American musical traditions. Cimafunk’s energetic performances and innovative style have positioned him as a leading figure in redefining contemporary Cuban music and Afro-Latin identity.
