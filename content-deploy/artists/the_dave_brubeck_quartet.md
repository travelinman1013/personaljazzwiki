## Biography
Dave Brubeck, born David Warren Brubeck on December 6, 1920, in Concord, California, was raised on his family's cattle ranch near Sacramento, where his mother, a classical pianist, introduced him to music. After serving in World War II, he studied composition at Mills College under French composer Darius Milhaud, who encouraged blending jazz with classical elements, leading to the formation of the Dave Brubeck Octet in 1946 with Milhaud students like Bill Smith and collaborators including Cal Tjader and Paul Desmond. In 1949, Brubeck formed a trio with Tjader and Ron Crotty, which evolved into the Dave Brubeck Quartet in 1951 after a severe neck injury from a diving accident in Hawaii altered his piano technique toward block chords.[1][2][5]

The Quartet, initially featuring Desmond on alto saxophone, gained popularity through residencies at San Francisco's Black Hawk nightclub and college tours, releasing live albums like *Jazz at Oberlin* (1953) and *Jazz Goes to College* (1954). The classic lineup from 1958–1967 included bassist Eugene Wright and drummer Joe Morello, achieving breakthrough success with the 1959 album *Time Out*, featuring unconventional time signatures in tracks like 'Take Five' and 'Blue Rondo à la Turk,' which sold over a million copies and popularized cool jazz. Brubeck supported racial integration, canceling performances where Wright faced discrimination.[3][4][5]

The Quartet disbanded in 1967 after a Mexico tour, but Brubeck continued with new ensembles, including ones featuring his son Chris, touring the Soviet Union in 1987 and performing for President Reagan at the 1988 Moscow Summit. His legacy endures as a pioneer of cool jazz, innovative rhythms, and cross-cultural compositions, earning him the first jazz *Time* magazine cover in 1954 and a National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Masters award.[1][5]

## Fun Facts
- In 1951, while recovering from a near-fatal diving accident in Hawaii that damaged his neck and vertebrae, Brubeck scribbled a note to Paul Desmond from his hospital bed: 'Maybe now we can start the quartet,' which Desmond kept for life.[1][2]
- Brubeck canceled multiple performances, including a 25-date Southern college tour in 1960 and a TV appearance, to protest racial discrimination against Black bassist Eugene Wright.[4]
- The Dave Brubeck Quartet was the first jazz band to grace the cover of *Time* magazine in 1954.[5]
- Brubeck named his son David Darius after mentor Darius Milhaud, born June 14, 1947.[1]
