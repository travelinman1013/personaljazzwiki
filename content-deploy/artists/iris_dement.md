## Biography
Iris DeMent is an acclaimed American singer-songwriter known for her deeply personal and evocative blend of folk, country, gospel, and Americana. Born on January 5, 1961, in Paragould, Arkansas, she was the youngest of fourteen children in a large Pentecostal family. Her early years were marked by hardship after her father lost his job, prompting the family to move from Arkansas to California, where DeMent was exposed to a rich tapestry of musical influences, including church hymns, gospel, and traditional country music. Her family’s musicality—her father played fiddle, her mother and siblings sang and played piano, and her sisters formed a gospel group—shaped her artistic sensibility[3][4].

DeMent began writing songs at age 25, inspired by her mother’s love of music and her own experiences of small-town life. After honing her craft at open-mic nights and moving briefly to Nashville, she connected with producer Jim Rooney, who helped her secure a record deal. Her 1992 debut album, 'Infamous Angel,' received universal acclaim and was later named one of the greatest country albums of all time by Rolling Stone. The album featured heartfelt songs about family and community, including 'Our Town,' which was used in the final episode of 'Northern Exposure.' Subsequent albums such as 'My Life' and 'The Way I Should' expanded her sound and subject matter, earning Grammy nominations and solidifying her reputation as a fearless, introspective songwriter[2][3][5].

Throughout her career, DeMent’s music has been celebrated for its emotional honesty, poetic lyricism, and rootsy authenticity. She has collaborated with legendary artists like John Prine, Emmylou Harris, and Steve Earle, and her songs have appeared in films and television shows, further broadening her influence. DeMent’s legacy is defined by her commitment to using music as a means of healing and social commentary, as well as her enduring impact on the Americana and folk genres[1][5].
