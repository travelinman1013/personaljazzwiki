## Biography
John Jackson was born on February 25, 1924, in Woodville, Rappahannock County, Virginia, into a musical family of tenant farmers as the seventh of 14 children. He began playing guitar around age five, learning from a convict on a chain gang, and later banjo, performing at local parties and dances on farms where he worked. In 1944, he married Cora Lee Carter, and by 1949, they moved to Fairfax Station, Virginia, where he prioritized family, working as a dairy farm hand, cook, butler, gravedigger, and general caretaker, largely setting aside public music after 1946 due to family demands and a fight at a party.[1][2][5][6][7]

Jackson's career revived in the 1960s through serendipity: while teaching guitar at a gas station to his mailman in 1964, folklorist Chuck Perdue overheard him, introduced him to the folk revival scene, and helped launch his professional path, including hearing Mississippi John Hurt perform. He debuted on record in 1965 with *Blues and Country Dance Tunes from Virginia* on Arhoolie Records, followed by more albums on Arhoolie, Rounder, and Alligator (including *Front Porch Blues* in 1999). A master of **Piedmont blues**, ragtime, folk, old-time hillbilly songs, and ballads, his confident fingerpicking, warm baritone, storytelling, and humor made him a festival favorite. He toured globally—Europe, Asia, Africa, South America, India—and performed at the White House, Carnegie Hall, Royal Albert Hall, Newport Folk Festival (14 times at Smithsonian Folklife Festival), earning the National Endowment for the Arts National Heritage Fellowship in 1986.[1][2][3][5][6]

Jackson remained rooted in Virginia, avoiding full-time road life, and continued performing into his late 70s until his death from liver cancer complications on January 20, 2002, in Fairfax Station. Celebrated as one of the last first-generation country bluesmen and a transcendent songster, his legacy endures through recordings, worldwide influence, and preservation of Black Appalachian Piedmont traditions, including rare banjo blues by an African American musician.[1][2][3][6]
