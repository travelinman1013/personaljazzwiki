## Biography
Rosinha de Valença, born Maria Rosa Canelas in 1941 in Valença, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, emerged as one of the most skilled and innovative guitarists in Brazilian music. Entranced by the music she heard on the radio as a child, she taught herself to play the acoustic guitar, inspired by her brother and the vibrant sounds of Rio. By age 12, she was already performing in local bars and restaurants, defying the gender norms of a conservative society that viewed guitar playing as a male pursuit.

In 1963, Rosinha moved to Rio de Janeiro to pursue music professionally, where she was given her stage name by journalist Sérgio Porto, reflecting her pride in her hometown. The early 1960s were a creative peak for Brazilian music, and Rosinha quickly became a fixture in the bossa nova and jazz scenes. Her big break came in 1964, touring internationally with Sérgio Mendes and Brasil ’65, which introduced her to global audiences. Throughout her career, she collaborated with renowned artists such as Stan Getz, Henry Mancini, and Sarah Vaughan, and released several acclaimed albums, including 'A Guitar in the Foreground' (1971). Despite her technical mastery and expressive style—marked by fiery, conversational guitar lines and occasional understated vocals—she was often overlooked in her home country due to prevailing sexism.

Rosinha's career was tragically cut short in the early 1990s when a heart attack left her in a coma, from which she never recovered. She passed away in 2004. In the years since her death, her contributions to bossa nova and MPB (Música Popular Brasileira) have been increasingly recognized, with tribute concerts and reappraisals of her groundbreaking work cementing her legacy as a pioneering female guitarist in Brazilian music.
