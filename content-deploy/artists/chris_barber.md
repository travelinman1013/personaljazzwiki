## Biography
Donald Christopher Barber, born on April 17, 1930, in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, England, was a pioneering English jazz musician best known as a bandleader and trombonist. He began his musical journey at age seven with violin lessons and later attended schools in Worcestershire and London, where his mother was headmistress. During World War II, he was evacuated to the west of England, where he discovered jazz through records like Coleman Hawkins’ 'Body and Soul,' sparking a lifelong passion. After the war, Barber immersed himself in London’s jazz scene, teaching himself trombone and studying at the Guildhall School of Music. In 1949, he formed his first band, the New Orleans Jazz Band, and quickly became a central figure in Britain’s trad-jazz revival.

Barber’s band, which evolved into the Chris Barber Jazz Band, became a major force in the 1950s, known for its authentic New Orleans jazz style and for launching the careers of key British musicians. His group’s recording of 'Petite Fleur' was a UK top twenty hit in 1959, and their inclusion of skiffle acts—most notably Lonnie Donegan—helped ignite a national craze that inspired future rock icons like John Lennon and Paul McCartney. Barber also played a crucial role in bringing American blues and R&B artists to Britain, fostering the British blues boom and influencing the rise of British rock & roll. He remained active for decades, adapting his band’s sound to include blues, swing, and mainstream jazz, and continued performing well into the 21st century.
