## Biography
Les Getrex is a blues guitarist, vocalist, and singer-songwriter who emerged from New Orleans' rich musical heritage. Growing up in the Sixth Ward of New Orleans as the fourth of five children, Getrex was immersed in music from an early age, drawing inspiration from the gospel church and the vibrant blues culture surrounding him. By 1975, he had developed sufficient confidence and technical skills to join his first band, Burnt Toast and Coffee, and purchased his first electric guitar, marking the beginning of his professional musical journey. His early work included the notable blues single "Don't Say A Mumblin' Word" released in 1976, which established him as a serious blues artist.

Throughout his career, Les Getrex has become recognized as one of the last authentic bluesmen, with a profound and genuine sound rooted deeply in New Orleans blues tradition. His blues-filled guitar work and soulful voice reflect his upbringing in the Sixth Ward, his gospel church background, and his lifelong dedication to the blues. Getrex has performed extensively throughout his career, including appearances at prestigious venues and festivals such as the New Orleans Jazz Fest in 2011, the Crescent City Blues & BBQ Fest in 2024, and the NOLA Jazz Museum in 2022. He has also expanded his reach internationally, delighting Russian fans in 2015, and has performed regularly aboard Norwegian Cruise Line's Breakaway ship in their Fat Cats Jazz & Blues Club. His band, Les Getrex and His All Star Band (also known as Les Getrex 'n' Creole Cookin'), continues to perform at various venues including The Rock R&B club in New Orleans, establishing him as an enduring figure in the contemporary blues scene.
