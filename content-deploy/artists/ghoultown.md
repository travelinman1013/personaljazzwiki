## Biography
Ghoultown is an American rock band formed in 1999 in Dallas, Texas, by vocalist and guitarist Count Lyle (Lyle Blackburn). The band emerged from the ashes of Blackburn's earlier projects, notably the doom metal band Solitude Aeturnus and the horrorpunk group The Killcreeps. Drawing on these diverse musical roots, Ghoultown developed a unique sound that blends psychobilly, horror punk, rockabilly, and southern gothic influences. Their music is characterized by dark, cinematic storytelling, spaghetti western-inspired instrumentation, and a theatrical flair that sets them apart from their peers. Over the years, Ghoultown has released multiple studio albums, live recordings, and EPs, toured extensively across the U.S. and Europe, and contributed to horror movie soundtracks, including a cameo in the film 'American Nightmare.' Their reputation as genre-benders has earned them a cult following and recognition in both the horror and alternative music scenes.

Ghoultown's musical style is often described as a crossroads between Johnny Cash and Rob Zombie, combining outlaw punk energy with gothic country melancholy and horror-themed lyrics. The band has maintained a fiercely independent spirit, refusing to be pigeonholed into any single genre or trend. Their live performances are known for their theatricality and energy, and they have appeared on syndicated television shows such as 'Elvira's Movie Macabre.' With a discography spanning over two decades, Ghoultown has cemented their legacy as pioneers of the horror-infused rockabilly and psychobilly movements.
