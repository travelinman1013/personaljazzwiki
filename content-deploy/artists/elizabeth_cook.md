## Biography
Elizabeth Cook, born July 18, 1972, in Wildwood, Florida, is an American country music singer, songwriter, radio host, and television personality known for her authentic, roots-oriented sound. Raised in a musical family—her mother Joyce was a hillbilly singer and her father Thomas a moonshiner who played upright bass in a prison band—Cook began performing at local bars, fairs, and festivals as a child. Her parents' love for country music and their own musical careers deeply influenced her early development. After graduating from Georgia Southern University with dual degrees in Accounting and Computer Information Systems, Cook moved to Nashville in 1996 to pursue music, eventually signing a publishing deal and releasing her major-label debut, 'Hey Y’all,' in 2002. Though the album received critical praise, it did not achieve mainstream commercial success, leading Cook to focus on independent releases and a relentless touring schedule. Over the years, she has released several acclaimed albums, including 'Balls' and 'Welder,' and has become a staple at the Grand Ole Opry, with over 400 appearances despite not being a member. Her music, often described as outlaw country, Americana, or alt-country, is celebrated for its honesty, wit, and connection to traditional country roots.

Cook’s career extends beyond music; she is the host of the SiriusXM Outlaw Country radio show 'Elizabeth Cook’s Apron Strings' and has appeared on television, including her own show 'Upstream.' Her performances have taken her across the United States and internationally, earning her a loyal fan base and critical acclaim. Cook’s legacy is marked by her resilience, creativity, and dedication to preserving the spirit of classic country music while pushing its boundaries.
