## Biography
The String Cheese Incident is a pioneering American jam band formed in 1993 in the mountain towns of Crested Butte and Telluride, Colorado. The original lineup consisted of Bill Nershi (guitar), Michael Kang (mandolin, violin), Keith Moseley (bass), and Michael Travis (drums, percussion), all of whom were avid skiers and musicians who began playing together in après-ski bars. Their chemistry and shared love for improvisational music quickly led them to pursue music full-time, and by 1995 they had relocated to Boulder, Colorado, where they added keyboardist Kyle Hollingsworth, a trained jazz musician, to the group. In 2006, percussionist Jason Hann joined, expanding their rhythmic palette even further.

The band's musical style is a vibrant fusion of bluegrass, newgrass, rock, funk, jazz, Latin, reggae, calypso, electronica, and psychedelia, making them difficult to categorize but instantly recognizable within the jam band scene. Their live shows are renowned for extended improvisational jams, genre-blending setlists, and a festive, communal atmosphere. The String Cheese Incident's commitment to independence is notable: they founded their own label, SCI Fidelity Records, and built a multifaceted business operation that includes management, merchandising, ticketing, and even a travel agency for fans. Their grassroots approach, relentless touring, and innovative business model have made them a central force in the jamgrass and jam band movements, inspiring a devoted following and influencing the broader live music industry.

Over three decades, The String Cheese Incident has released numerous studio and live albums, collaborated with a wide range of artists, and remained a fixture at major festivals. Their legacy is defined by musical versatility, entrepreneurial spirit, and a lasting impact on the culture of improvisational music.
