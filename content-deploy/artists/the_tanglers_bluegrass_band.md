## Biography
The Tanglers Bluegrass Band is a spirited ensemble that emerged from the vibrant musical melting pot of New Orleans, Louisiana. The group came together when a collection of like-minded musicians united around their shared passion for bluegrass and traditional acoustic music. Despite originating from a city known for jazz, funk, and R&B, the Tanglers carved out a distinctive niche by weaving together bluegrass, folk, and funk influences into their sound.

The band's musical approach deliberately moves away from the flashy, technically virtuosic "hot-licks" that often characterize bluegrass music, instead favoring a more grounded and accessible style. Their debut album, 'Backwards Burner,' showcases this philosophy, presenting a fresh take on bluegrass that reflects their New Orleans origins while honoring traditional acoustic instrumentation. The ensemble's willingness to blend genres and their collaborative spirit have established them as an innovative voice within the contemporary bluegrass scene.
