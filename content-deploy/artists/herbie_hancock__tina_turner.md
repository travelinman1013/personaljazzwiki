## Biography
Herbert Jeffrey Hancock was born on April 12, 1940, and emerged as one of jazz's most transformative figures. His exceptional talent manifested early—at age 11, he performed Mozart's D Major Piano Concerto with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. During his high school years, Hancock developed a dual passion for jazz and electronics, influenced by pianists Oscar Peterson and Bill Evans. He pursued this multifaceted interest by double-majoring in music composition and electrical engineering at Grinnell College in Iowa, a foundation that would define his innovative approach to jazz throughout his career.

Discovered by trumpeter Donald Byrd in 1960, Hancock quickly established himself as a compositional and improvisational virtuoso. His 1963 debut album *Takin' Off* produced the enduring hit "Watermelon Man" and caught the attention of Miles Davis, who invited him to join the Second Great Quintet in 1963. During his five years with Davis (1963-1968), Hancock fundamentally altered jazz by expanding the role of the rhythm section alongside bassist Ron Carter and drummer Tony Williams, helping architect the post-bop sound. His sophisticated compositions like "Maiden Voyage," "Cantaloupe Island," and "Speak Like a Child" demonstrated his gift for blending accessibility with harmonic complexity.

After leaving Davis, Hancock formed The Headhunters and released *Head Hunters* in 1973, which became the first jazz album to achieve platinum status and introduced jazz fusion to mainstream audiences. His 1983 collaboration with producer Bill Laswell on *Future Shock* produced the iconic single "Rockit," which dominated MTV and dance charts while winning a Grammy Award. Beyond music, Hancock composed the Academy Award-winning score for *Round Midnight* in 1987 and has mentored emerging talents including Wynton Marsalis. A fourteen-time Grammy Award winner, Hancock remains a jazz icon who has participated in every major jazz movement since the 1960s, continuously evolving his sound across acoustic jazz, fusion, funk, and electronic music.
