## Biography
Le Tigre is an electronic rock band formed in 1998 in New York City, emerging from the riot grrrl movement as a post-punk feminist project. The band originated when Kathleen Hanna, vocalist and founding member of the influential punk band Bikini Kill, decided to pursue a new musical direction after Bikini Kill's dissolution. Hanna relocated from Portland, Oregon to New York City in 1998, where she connected with Johanna Fateman, a zine-maker and guitarist, and Sadie Benning, a video artist and filmmaker. The trio conceived of Le Tigre as a multimedia project that would be more playful and light-hearted than Bikini Kill while maintaining strong feminist and political activism themes. JD Samson, initially joining as a projectionist and roadie, officially became a band member in 2001, solidifying the classic lineup that would define the band's sound and visual aesthetic.

Le Tigre's musical approach represented a radical departure from traditional punk instrumentation. The band abandoned conventional guitars and drums in favor of drum-machine beats, looped 8-bit samples, and serrated guitar riffs paired with call-and-response vocals, creating what they described as music "for the party after the protest." Their self-titled debut album, released in October 1999, established their signature sound and introduced their multimedia performance philosophy, which incorporated slide projectors, video art, and visual installations as integral components of their live shows. The band's conceptually-driven approach positioned them within a loose network of like-minded electronic artists including Tracy + the Plastics, Peaches, and Chicks on Speed. Le Tigre released several albums including "Feminist Sweepstakes" and "This Island" (their first major label release on Universal Records in 2004), before disbanding in 2005 due to Kathleen Hanna's battle with late-stage Lyme Disease. The band reunited for a performance at the This Ain't No Picnic festival at the Rose Bowl in August 2022, seventeen years after their final show, cementing their legacy as pioneers of feminist electronic music and DIY culture.

Le Tigre's influence on electronic music, queercore, and feminist activism remains significant. The band's commitment to merging political messaging with accessible pop sensibilities, combined with their innovative multimedia performances, established a template for politically engaged electronic music. Their work demonstrated that experimental electronic music could be both intellectually rigorous and joyfully danceable, challenging the boundaries between art, activism, and entertainment. The band's DIY ethos and their eventual navigation of major label politics while maintaining artistic integrity provided important lessons for independent artists navigating the music industry.

## Fun Facts
- Le Tigre initially conceived of themselves as a multimedia project incorporating video art, DIY performances, and Zen culture, with their message being serious but their music full of color and irony.
- The band's final show before their 17-year hiatus was on September 24, 2005, at the Operation Ceasefire concert at the Washington Monument in Washington DC, where they performed as part of a coalition of artists calling for an end to the U.S. war in Iraq.
- Kathleen Hanna's battle with late-stage Lyme Disease, which wouldn't be properly diagnosed for six years after the band's breakup, was the primary reason for Le Tigre's dissolution in 2005.
- Le Tigre created their own independent record label, Le Tigre Records, solely for the purpose of re-releasing their back catalog on an independent label after signing with Universal Records, demonstrating their commitment to maintaining artistic control.
