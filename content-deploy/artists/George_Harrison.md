## Biography
George Harrison (25 February 1943 – 29 November 2001) was born in Liverpool, England, into a working-class family. He developed an early passion for music, inspired by rock and roll pioneers such as Elvis Presley and Buddy Holly. Harrison met Paul McCartney at school, who introduced him to John Lennon, leading to his joining the Quarrymen, the group that would evolve into The Beatles. As the youngest member, Harrison quickly established himself as the band's lead guitarist, contributing a distinctive melodic style and, over time, his own compositions.

During his tenure with The Beatles, Harrison's songwriting matured, yielding classics like 'Here Comes the Sun,' 'Something,' and 'While My Guitar Gently Weeps.' He was instrumental in introducing Indian music and instruments, notably the sitar, to Western pop, influenced by his friendship with Ravi Shankar. After The Beatles disbanded in 1970, Harrison launched a successful solo career, beginning with the acclaimed triple album 'All Things Must Pass.' He also became known for his humanitarian work, organizing the pioneering Concert for Bangladesh in 1971, and later co-founding the supergroup Traveling Wilburys.

Harrison's music blended rock, folk, and Indian influences, often reflecting his deep spirituality and interest in Eastern philosophies. His legacy endures through his innovative guitar work, genre-crossing compositions, and influence on subsequent generations of musicians. He remains celebrated as both a Beatle and a solo artist, recognized for expanding the boundaries of popular music.
