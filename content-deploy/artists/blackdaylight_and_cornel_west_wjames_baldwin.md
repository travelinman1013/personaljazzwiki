## Biography
Blackdaylight & Cornel West w/James Baldwin is a spoken word project that brings together the voices and legacies of three distinct figures: Blackdaylight (an independent spoken word artist), Dr. Cornel West (a renowned philosopher and public intellectual), and archival recordings of James Baldwin (the celebrated American writer and civil rights activist). While Blackdaylight is a contemporary artist whose detailed biography is not widely documented, Cornel West and James Baldwin are both towering figures in American intellectual and cultural life.

James Baldwin (1924–1987), born in Harlem, New York, rose to prominence as a novelist, essayist, and civil rights activist. His works, such as 'Go Tell It on the Mountain' and 'Notes of a Native Son,' explored themes of race, sexuality, and identity, making him a leading voice in the civil rights and gay liberation movements[1]. Cornel West, born in 1953 in Tulsa, Oklahoma, is a philosopher, theologian, and activist whose writings and lectures—most notably in 'Race Matters' and 'Black Prophetic Fire'—continue Baldwin's tradition of prophetic critique and moral engagement[2][7].

The collaboration, as represented in the project 'Blackdaylight & Cornel West w/James Baldwin,' is a fusion of spoken word, philosophy, and archival audio. It draws on Baldwin's eloquence and courage, West's intellectual rigor and activism, and Blackdaylight's contemporary artistry to address enduring questions of justice, identity, and resilience. The musical style is rooted in spoken word and jazz-influenced rhythms, emphasizing the power of language and performance to inspire social change.
