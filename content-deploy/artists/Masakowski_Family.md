## Biography
The Masakowski Family is a renowned jazz ensemble from New Orleans, centered around guitarist Steve Masakowski, his daughter Sasha Masakowski (vocals), and his son Martin Masakowski (bass). The family's musical journey began in a household steeped in both jazz and classical traditions—Steve, a celebrated jazz guitarist and professor, and his wife Ulrike Antonie Sprenger, a concert pianist, fostered a creative environment where music was a constant presence. Sasha recalls composing at the piano with her father from the age of six, while Martin gravitated toward the bass, both children absorbing influences from their parents and the vibrant New Orleans scene.[1][2][3]

Steve Masakowski's own career is marked by innovation and leadership in jazz: after studying at Berklee College of Music, he returned to New Orleans, collaborating with local greats and international stars, founding groups like Astral Project and Mars, and eventually serving as Chair of Jazz Studies at the University of New Orleans. The Masakowski Family Band emerged as a formal project in the 2010s, blending their individual talents and experiences. Their 2016 album 'N.O. Escape' showcases their collective artistry, drawing on jazz standards, New Orleans rhythms, and contemporary improvisation.[2][3][4]

Musically, the Masakowski Family is known for their sophisticated interplay, genre-blending arrangements, and a deep respect for both jazz tradition and modern experimentation. Sasha, in particular, brings elements of electronic music and global influences to the group, while Martin's bass work is noted for its creativity and technical prowess. Their legacy is one of intergenerational collaboration, mentorship, and a commitment to advancing New Orleans' jazz heritage.
