## Biography
Robert Glasper, born April 5, 1978, in Houston, Texas, is a Grammy-winning pianist, composer, producer, and arranger whose work bridges the worlds of jazz, hip-hop, R&B, and neo soul. Raised by his mother, Kim Yvette Glasper, a professional blues and jazz singer, Glasper was immersed in music from an early age, performing in church and absorbing a wide array of influences[3][4][5]. He later attended the New School for Jazz and Contemporary Music in New York City, where he developed his craft and forged key relationships, notably with neo-soul artist Bilal[4][8].

Glasper's career took off with his debut album 'Mood' (2002), but it was his genre-defying approach—melding jazz improvisation with the rhythms and sensibilities of hip-hop and R&B—that set him apart[3][2]. His 2012 album 'Black Radio' was a critical and commercial breakthrough, winning the Grammy Award for Best R&B Album and establishing Glasper as a leading figure in contemporary Black music[5][3]. He has since released multiple acclaimed albums, including 'Black Radio 2', 'Covered', and 'Black Radio III', and has collaborated with a diverse roster of artists across genres, from Kendrick Lamar and Common to Norah Jones and Erykah Badu[2][5].

Glasper's musical style is characterized by its fluid blending of genres, technical virtuosity, and a deep respect for the Black musical tradition. He has been recognized not only for his innovative recordings but also for his work as a composer for film and television, and as an Artist in Residence at major venues such as the Kennedy Center and Carnegie Hall[5]. His influence extends to a new generation of musicians who see him as a bridge between jazz's storied past and its vibrant, genre-blurring future.
