## Biography
Ray Charles Robinson was born on September 23, 1930, in Albany, Georgia, and raised in Greenville, Florida, where his musical journey began at the tender age of three when he was captivated by boogie-woogie piano at Wylie Pitman's Red Wing Cafe. Tragedy struck early in his life - he began losing his sight at age five due to congenital juvenile glaucoma and was declared legally blind by age seven, the same year his younger brother George accidentally drowned. Despite these devastating setbacks and dire poverty, his mother Aretha Williams pushed him toward independence and enrolled him at the Florida School for the Deaf and Blind in St. Augustine, where he received formal musical training from 1937 to 1945, mastering piano, organ, clarinet, trumpet, and saxophone while learning to read music in Braille.

After his mother's death in 1945, fifteen-year-old Charles left school to pursue music professionally, joining the South's 'chitlin' circuit and performing throughout Florida in black dance halls in Orlando, Tampa, and Jacksonville. In Tampa, he played with The Florida Playboys and made his first three recordings while wearing his signature sunglasses for the first time. In 1948, seeking better opportunities, he moved to Seattle, Washington, with just $600, where he initially modeled himself on Nat King Cole as a crooner and cut his first record. It was in Seattle that he met 14-year-old Quincy Jones, beginning a lifelong personal and professional relationship.

By the late 1950s and early 1960s, Ray Charles had pioneered a revolutionary new style that became known as 'soul music' - a groundbreaking blend of gospel, blues, and jazz that brought him worldwide fame. His passionate piano playing, unique voice, and tireless showmanship made him a legendary figure, earning him the title 'the Genius of Soul' and 'Father of Soul.' His signature piece 'Georgia on My Mind' became a number-one pop hit in 1960 and was later designated as Georgia's official state song in 1979. Over four decades, Charles defied musical boundaries and became one of the foremost icons in modern American music history, bringing soul music into the mainstream and influencing countless artists across multiple genres.

## Fun Facts
- Ray Charles first wore his signature sunglasses while performing with The Florida Playboys in Tampa, Florida
- He chose Seattle as his destination in 1948 because it was as far away as he could get from where he was, moving there with only $600
- Charles was born the same year that Hoagy Carmichael composed 'Georgia on My Mind,' which would later become his signature song
- He learned to play classical composers like Frederic Chopin, Ludwig van Beethoven, and Johann Strauss while at the school for the blind, alongside his love for jazz and blues
