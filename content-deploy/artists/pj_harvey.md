## Biography
Polly Jean Harvey, known professionally as PJ Harvey, was born on October 9, 1969, in Bridport, Dorset, England, and grew up on a farm in Corscombe, Dorset. She began her musical journey in 1988 as a member of the Bristol-based band Automatic Dlamini, where she played guitar, saxophone, and provided vocals. This formative period introduced her to key collaborators, notably John Parish, who would become a lifelong creative partner.

In 1991, Harvey formed the PJ Harvey trio with Rob Ellis and Steve Vaughan, quickly gaining critical attention with the raw, visceral albums 'Dry' (1992) and 'Rid of Me' (1993). After the trio disbanded, Harvey embarked on a solo career, evolving her sound with each release. Her work spans alternative rock, art pop, and singer-songwriter traditions, characterized by her distinctive voice, multi-instrumental skills, and evocative, often mythic lyricism. Albums like 'To Bring You My Love' (1995), 'Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea' (2000), and 'Let England Shake' (2011) have been especially lauded, earning her two Mercury Prizes—the only artist to win the award twice.

Harvey's legacy is marked by her fearless reinvention, critical acclaim, and influence on alternative and indie music. She has collaborated with a range of artists and producers, including John Parish, Mick Harvey, and Flood, and her work has inspired a generation of musicians with its emotional depth and innovative approach. In 2013, she was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) for her contributions to music.
