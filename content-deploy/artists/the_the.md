## Biography
The The is an English rock band formed in 1979 in London by singer-songwriter Matt Johnson, who remains the only constant member throughout the band's history. Johnson began his musical journey at an exceptionally young age, forming his first band at 11 years old and dropping out of school at 15 to work as an apprentice sound engineer at De Wolfe Studios in Soho, London. Originally conceived as a multimedia art collective inspired by the Plastic Ono Band, The The emerged from Johnson's experimental work with reel-to-reel tape, initially conducted in the basement of his parents' pub in Loughton, Essex. The band made their official debut on May 11, 1979, at London's Africa Centre, performing with backing tape tracks that Johnson had created during his studio work.

Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, The The achieved significant critical acclaim and commercial success, becoming a defining force in the post-punk and new wave movements. The band's breakthrough came with their 1986 album Infected, which reached number 14 on the UK Albums Chart and spent 30 weeks on the chart, becoming their most commercially successful release. This was followed by the top-ten albums Mind Bomb (1989) and Dusk (1993), with the latter debuting at number 2 in the UK. The band accumulated 15 chart singles, with seven reaching the top 40. Johnson's songwriting approach evolved significantly over time, incorporating diverse influences and collaborators—from ex-Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr to singer Sinéad O'Connor—while maintaining his distinctive artistic vision as a "diviner of truth, whether of a personal or political nature."

After 2002, Johnson shifted his creative focus toward composing music for film, documentaries, and art installations, effectively placing The The in hiatus for over a decade. The band's revival began in 2018 with a tour of their iconic hits and the release of the live album The Comeback Special: Live at the Royal Albert Hall, marking Johnson's return to seriously considering new music for The The. This resurgence demonstrated the enduring relevance of the band's catalog and Johnson's continued artistic vitality as an alternative rock veteran.

## Fun Facts
- Matt Johnson formed The The at just 17 years old after dropping out of school at 15 to work as an apprentice sound engineer at De Wolfe Studios in Soho, London, where he used downtime to create his own music.
- The band's name 'the The' was suggested by Keith Laws, the synthesizer player in the original lineup, and Johnson later had his early solo album Burning Blue Soul re-credited to the The so all his albums would be shelved together in record stores.
- The creation of the 1989 album Mind Bomb involved an intensive inner journey where Matt Johnson practiced meditation, consumed magic mushrooms, and studied religious texts to inform the album's spiritual and philosophical themes.
- The The were originally conceived less as a traditional band and more as a multimedia art collective inspired by the Plastic Ono Band, with Johnson's early experiments involving reel-to-reel tape work conducted in the basement of his parents' pub in Loughton, Essex.
