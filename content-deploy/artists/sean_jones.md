## Biography
Sean Jones, a renowned jazz trumpeter, bandleader, composer, educator, and activist, was born in Warren, Ohio, where he sang and performed in the church choir as a child. Initially playing drums, he switched to trumpet at age 10 after hearing Miles Davis, whose artistic vision and sound became his greatest influence, alongside John Coltrane's profound impact that shaped his path as a musician and educator. After earning a master's degree from Rutgers University, Jones joined the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra for a six-month stint, which led to Wynton Marsalis offering him the permanent lead trumpeter position from 2004 to 2010.[1][2][6]

Jones's career flourished as a leader, releasing eight albums on Mack Avenue Records, including *Live from Jazz at the Bistro* (2017) and *No Need For Words* (2011), emphasizing emotional melodies and strong band chemistry inspired by Miles Davis's approach to assembling top talent. His musical style blends gospel roots, jazz tradition, and innovation, performing across genres with symphony orchestras and chamber groups. A key collaborator with figures like Marcus Miller, he joined the 2011 Tribute to Miles tour with Miller, Herbie Hancock, and Wayne Shorter, and became a member of the SFJAZZ Collective in 2015.[1][3][6]

Deeply committed to education and activism, Jones served as chair of the Brass Department at Berklee College of Music, taught at Duquesne University and Oberlin Conservatory, and in 2018 became the Richard and Elizabeth Case Chair in Jazz Studies at Johns Hopkins University's Peabody Institute. He is artistic director of the Pittsburgh Jazz Orchestra and Carnegie Hall’s NYO Jazz, president of the Jazz Education Network, and Artist-in-Residence at San Francisco Performances, championing artists' authentic expression.[1][2][7]
