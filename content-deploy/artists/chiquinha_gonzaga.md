## Biography
Francisca Edwiges Neves Gonzaga, known as **Chiquinha Gonzaga**, was born on October 17, 1847, in Rio de Janeiro, then the court city of the Brazilian Empire, to a high-ranking white military officer and a mother who was a freed Black woman and former slave.[2][4][8] Raised in a strict upper‑class, military household, she received an unusually solid education for a girl at the time, studying reading, mathematics, religion, and especially piano, which became her great vocation.[3][4] By age 11 she had composed her first piece, “Canção dos Pastores,” for a Christmas celebration at home.[2][3][4] Married off in an arranged union as a teenager, she rejected the constraints of an unhappy marriage, left her husband, and was consequently ostracized by her family and polite society.[3][5] To survive, she turned fully to music, teaching piano, playing in music stores and cafés, and soon entering Rio’s lively popular scene.

In the 1870s Gonzaga emerged as a pioneering figure in Brazilian popular music. She joined the choro group led by flautist Joaquim Callado, becoming the **first pianist of choro** and one of the earliest women to perform in that milieu.[2][3][4][5] Her 1876–77 polka “Atraente,” improvised at a choro gathering, became her first major hit and established her as a leading composer and instrumentalist of ballroom popular music, even as it caused scandal in conservative court circles.[2][3] Over subsequent decades she wrote polkas, waltzes, tangos, lundus, maxixes, fados, quadrilles, mazurkas, choros and serenades, skillfully blending Brazilian popular idioms with European forms.[1][3][6] In 1885 she debuted as a **conductor** with her operetta *A Corte na Roça*, thereby becoming **Brazil’s first woman conductor**, and went on to compose music for 77 theatre works, with major successes such as *Forrobodó*, *Juriti* (co‑written with Viriato Corrêa) and her 1899 carnival march “Ó Abre Alas,” regarded as the first song written specifically for Brazilian Carnival.[1][2][3][6]

Gonzaga’s career also had a strong social and political dimension. She was an active supporter of the abolitionist movement leading up to the end of slavery in Brazil in 1888 and was known for her advocacy of social equality.[1][2][4] As her music became widely disseminated—and often used without permission—she fought for authors’ rights and in 1917 helped found the **Brazilian Society of Theater Authors (SBAT)**, the country’s first organization devoted to collecting and defending copyrights for composers and playwrights.[1][2][3] Over her long life she composed roughly 2,000 pieces and remained musically active into her late eighties, writing her last stage score, *Maria*, in the 1930s.[2][3] She shared her later life with João Batista Fernandes Lage, a Portuguese partner 36 years her junior, whom she met in 1899 and with whom she remained until her death.[2] Celebrated as a trailblazer for women in music and a foundational figure in Brazilian popular and theatrical music, Chiquinha Gonzaga died in Rio de Janeiro on February 28, 1935, at the age of 87.[1][3]

## Fun Facts

- Her 1876 polka “Atraente,” printed when she was in her late twenties, not only launched her public career but also caused a scandal in Emperor Dom Pedro II’s court because of its association with popular dance and street musicians.[2][3]
- The 1899 march “Ó Abre Alas,” written for a Carnival group, is widely regarded as the **first song composed expressly for Brazilian Carnival**, making her a foundational figure in shaping Carnival’s sound.[2][3][7]
- In 1917 she co‑founded the Brazilian Society of Theater Authors (SBAT), the country’s first organization to defend composers’ and playwrights’ copyrights, after seeing her own works repeatedly used without authorization.[1][2][3]
