## Biography
Steve Turre, born Stephen Johnson Turre on September 12, 1948, in Omaha, Nebraska, is a renowned American jazz trombonist, composer, arranger, and educator. Raised in the San Francisco Bay Area by Mexican-American parents, Turre was immersed from an early age in the sounds of mariachi, blues, and jazz. He began playing trombone at age ten and, after a brief stint on a football scholarship at California State University, Sacramento, shifted his focus to music, performing with the Escovedo Brothers salsa band and later studying at the University of North Texas College of Music.

Turre's professional career gained momentum in 1972 when Ray Charles hired him for a tour, and a year later, he joined Art Blakey’s Jazz Messengers through the mentorship of trumpeter Woody Shaw. Over the decades, Turre has collaborated with a wide array of jazz, Latin, and pop luminaries, including Dizzy Gillespie, McCoy Tyner, Herbie Hancock, Tito Puente, Mongo Santamaria, and Rahsaan Roland Kirk. Kirk notably introduced Turre to the use of seashells as musical instruments, a practice Turre embraced and developed, even discovering ancestral connections to the tradition. Turre has since become a pioneer in integrating seashells into jazz, most famously through his ensemble Sanctified Shells, and has released over 20 albums as a bandleader.

A fixture in the Saturday Night Live Band since 1985, Turre is celebrated for his innovative blending of jazz, Afro-Cuban, and Brazilian influences, as well as his commitment to both honoring and expanding jazz traditions. His legacy is marked by technical mastery, creative risk-taking, and a unique voice that bridges the past and future of jazz.
