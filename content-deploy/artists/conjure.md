## Biography
Conjurer is a British metal band formed in 2014 in the Midlands, England, comprising vocalist/guitarist Brady Deeprose, vocalist/guitarist Dan Nightingale, bassist Conor Marshall, and drummer Jan Krause.[2] The four members met through the local metalcore scene in Rugby, where they played in separate bands at venues like The Vault before coming together with a shared vision to create more ambitious and expansive music.[2] Brady Deeprose, born September 6, 1994, in Daventry, Northamptonshire, initially pursued classical music, performing cello at the Royal Albert Hall by age 13, before gravitating toward metal through his father's influence and the visceral impact of bands like Slipknot.[2] After Deeprose completed his Music Performance degree at the University of Northampton in 2014, the band officially formed and began establishing themselves on the UK metal circuit.

Conjurer achieved breakthrough recognition with their debut album Mire, released in March 2018 via Holy Roar Records, which garnered widespread critical acclaim from Metal Hammer UK, Kerrang!, BBC Radio 1, and numerous international publications.[3] The album's darkly poetic lyrics and sonic savagery earned it positions on countless year-end lists and nominations from Kerrang!, the Heavy Music Awards, and Metal Hammer's Golden Gods.[3] Following Mire's release, the band embarked on extensive touring, supporting technical death metal acts like Rivers of Nihil and Voivod, making their Download Festival debut in 2019, and completing a sold-out UK headline tour by late 2019.[3] In 2020, amid allegations of sexual abuse against Holy Roar founder Alex Fitzpatrick, Conjurer quietly transitioned to Nuclear Blast Records, where they continued their trajectory as one of the UK's most vital metal acts.[2] The band released their second album Páthos on Nuclear Blast, maintaining their reputation for crushing, monolithic metal that prioritizes musical integrity and genuine expression over commercial contrivance.[2]

## Fun Facts
- Brady Deeprose initially started playing cello in school specifically to avoid RE (Religious Education) lessons, a decision that sparked his lifelong passion for performing and eventually led to him performing at London's Royal Albert Hall by age 13.[2]
- The band's first concert experience for multiple members occurred at The Vault in Rugby, where Brady, Dan, Conor, and Jan all played in separate bands on the same bill supporting Sylosis before forming Conjurer.[2]
- Brady's childhood musical hero was Justin Hawkins of The Darkness, whom his father took him to see multiple times in Paris and across Europe before he was old enough to attend concerts independently.[2]
- During the COVID-19 pandemic, Conjurer used the lockdown period productively to record and craft their second album Páthos, which they released after returning to live performances at the Download Pilot 2021 and Bloodstock 2021 mainstages.[3]
