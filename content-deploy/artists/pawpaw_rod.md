## Biography
Rodney Hulsey, known professionally as PawPaw Rod, was born in Hawaii and primarily raised in Oklahoma as a military brat, frequently moving due to his family's circumstances, which made finding a sense of belonging challenging.[1][2][4][7] His early passion for music emerged around age seven during a church performance where he boldly sang 'Victory is Mine' solo after a tantrum, earning praise from his grandmother, and he began performing in bands by age 15 while making music for over a decade before his breakout.[1] Family ties to Oklahoma influenced his style, seen in cowboy aesthetics like square-toed boots and a Stetson hat, providing roots amid constant relocation.[1]

PawPaw Rod debuted in late 2020 with the viral hit 'HIT EM WHERE IT HURTS,' blending 60s soul, funk, hip-hop, Motown, and indie R&B into a laid-back, feel-good sound likened to Bill Withers and Gil Scott-Heron.[1][2][3] Now LA-based, he released self-titled EPs *A PawPaw Rod EP* and *Another PawPaw Rod EP*, emphasizing authenticity, vulnerability, and immersive live performances, with recent tracks like 'Is It Magic?' reflecting his evolution through persistence, self-belief, and community.[1] His music often serves as a soundtrack for TikTok users, showcasing his carefree positive energy.[1]

Though early in his career, PawPaw Rod's legacy builds on longevity and resilience, valuing travel to connect with global communities—a contrast to his nomadic childhood—and performing at festivals, fashion events, and venues worldwide, cementing his authentic artistry.[1]
