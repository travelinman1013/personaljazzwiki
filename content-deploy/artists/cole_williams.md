## Biography
Cole Williams is a Brooklyn-born Jamaican-American singer, songwriter, record producer, multi-instrumentalist, bandleader, and radio presenter whose career bridges genres and cultures[1][2][8]. Her early life was steeped in music, from classical piano recitals at Carnegie Hall to singing in her church choir, and she later studied classical voice at New Jersey City University[1]. Williams' upbringing was shaped by her parents' diverse record collection and her Caribbean heritage, which instilled in her a love for blending musical styles and a commitment to social justice through her art[2].

Williams' professional journey began in Europe, where she performed her own music and worked as a background singer for Grammy-winning African superstar Somi and American pop artist Aloe Blacc[2]. In 2015, she relocated to New Orleans, drawn by the city's unique fusion of African, European, and Caribbean influences, and quickly established herself as a vital force in its music scene. Her work spans funk, world, R&B, reggae, and soul, and she is recognized as a "Soul Queen of New Orleans," joining the ranks of legends like Irma Thomas and Betty Harris[2]. Williams is also a noted community leader, founding the Greater New Orleans Citizens Relief Team and advocating for the houseless population.

Her career highlights include international recognition for her single "A Better Woman," which garnered over half a million streams on Spotify and won the 2024 International Songwriting Competition[2][6]. Williams has performed at major festivals such as the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival and the French Quarter Festival, and she has collaborated with numerous New Orleans icons. Her legacy is defined by her innovative musical style, her dedication to social change, and her role as a mentor and advocate for artists' rights[2][3][7].
