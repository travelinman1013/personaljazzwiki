## Biography
Neville Dickie (born 1 January 1937 in Durham, England) is a leading English pianist celebrated for his mastery of classic jazz piano styles, especially stride and boogie‑woogie.[1][2] Growing up in County Durham, he began working professionally as a pianist at around 16, playing in a working men’s club in his home region.[3] After serving in the Royal Air Force, he left the North East for London, where he supported himself with low‑paid pub gigs while refining a repertoire steeped in early jazz and American ragtime he had sought out as a young man.[1][3] His breakthrough came when Doreen Davies, then head of BBC Radio 2, heard him at a BBC audition and began featuring him regularly on the air, launching a long association with the BBC and helping establish him nationally as one of Britain’s foremost stride and boogie‑woogie specialists.[1][2] 

Through the late 1960s and 1970s Dickie built an international reputation, scoring a UK Top 40 hit in 1969 with his single "Robin's Return" and achieving strong sales with his 1975 album *Back to Boogie*, which sold over 100,000 copies.[1] He went on to record scores of albums under his own name, including *Eye Opener* (1982), *Taken in Stride* (1985), and themed tributes such as *Neville Dickie Meets Fats, the Lion, and the Lamb* (1988), while also appearing as a sideman on hundreds of jazz recordings.[1] His playing combines the powerful left‑hand drive and rhythmic exuberance of boogie‑woogie with the intricate right‑hand syncopations and harmonic richness of Harlem stride piano, drawing on the legacy of early jazz masters while maintaining a crisp, contemporary attack.[2][7][8] From the 1980s he expanded his work as a bandleader, forming his group the Rhythmakers in 1985 and later leading trios and small ensembles.

Dickie’s career has been notably international: he has performed extensively across Europe and North America, becoming a regular attraction at American traditional jazz and ragtime festivals such as the Scott Joplin International Ragtime Festival in Sedalia, Missouri, and frequent mid‑Atlantic dates hosted by the Tri‑State Jazz Society.[1][5] In the United States he often appears with the Midiri Brothers, and he has also recorded with French stride specialist Louis Mazetier and numerous traditional jazz players.[1][5] Widely regarded as one of the world’s finest exponents of stride and boogie‑woogie piano, Dickie has helped sustain and popularize these early jazz piano traditions well into the 21st century, earning equal respect from aficionados in Britain and the U.S. for his authentic style, technical command, and dedication to classic jazz repertoire.[2][5][8]
