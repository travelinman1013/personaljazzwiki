## Biography
Hiram Law Bullock, born September 11, 1955, in Osaka, Japan, to African American parents serving in the U.S. military (one source notes a CIA career), moved to Baltimore, Maryland, at age two. He displayed early musical talent, studying classical piano at the Peabody Conservatory of Music and performing publicly at age six. Experimenting with saxophone and bass guitar, he took up electric guitar at 16, later attending the University of Miami where he met influential musicians like Pat Metheny, Steve Morse, Jaco Pastorius, and Will Lee, funding his studies through Florida nightclub gigs.[1][2][3]
