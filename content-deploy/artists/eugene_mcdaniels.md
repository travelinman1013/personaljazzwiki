## Biography
Eugene Booker McDaniels (February 12, 1935 – July 29, 2011) was an American singer, songwriter, and producer whose career spanned jazz, soul, R&B, and politically charged funk. Born in Kansas City, Kansas, and raised in Omaha, Nebraska, McDaniels began singing gospel in church and formed his first group, the Echoes of Joy, as a teenager. He studied at the University of Omaha Conservatory of Music, developing his skills on saxophone and trumpet before joining the Mississippi Piney Woods Singers and touring California. 

McDaniels found early success in the 1960s as Gene McDaniels, recording hits like "A Hundred Pounds of Clay" and "Tower of Strength," both of which reached the top five of the Billboard Hot 100. His smooth vocal style and pop sensibility brought him mainstream attention, but by the late 1960s, McDaniels shifted focus, responding to the political climate and civil rights struggles. After the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., he moved to Europe, returning as Eugene McDaniels with a more radical, socially conscious voice. His albums 'Outlaw' (1970) and 'Headless Heroes of the Apocalypse' (1971) became cult classics for their incisive critiques of American society and innovative blend of jazz, funk, and soul.

McDaniels' influence extended beyond his own recordings; he wrote the protest anthem "Compared to What" and Roberta Flack's hit "Feel Like Makin' Love," and produced for major labels. His legacy is that of a boundary-pushing artist who fused artistry with activism, leaving a lasting mark on soul, jazz, and hip-hop.
