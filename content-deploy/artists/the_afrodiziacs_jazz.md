## Biography
The Afrodiziac's Jazz is a 7-piece **Ethiopian jazz group** formed in **New Orleans**, best known locally as a jazz band 'with a twist' that has grown in popularity since 2018[2]. The ensemble takes a distinctive New Orleans perspective on the music of **Mulatu Astatke**, other Ethiopian composers, and broader African influences, blending these with jazz funk and latin jazz elements as noted on Spotify[context]. Led single-handedly by a female bandleader who also directs other projects like the all-female Bras Band, the group reinterprets Ethiopian jazz to evoke New Orleans sounds[4][6].

Saxophone player **Maude Caillat** plays a key role, having learned Ethiopian jazz while living in **Paris**, which informs their unique fusion style[7]. Active in the local scene, they perform at venues like the Marigny Opera House and emphasize African musical traditions through an innovative lens[4]. Their sound has developed steadily, earning recognition as a fresh take on global jazz influences within the vibrant New Orleans music community[2].
