## Biography
Edward Estlin Cummings, known as e.e. cummings, was born on October 14, 1894, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, to a Unitarian minister father and a supportive mother. He attended Cambridge Latin High School, studying Latin and Greek, and decided to become a poet as a child, writing a poem daily from ages eight to twenty-two. Cummings earned a B.A. from Harvard in 1915 and an M.A. in 1916, where he developed an interest in modern poetry that disregarded conventional grammar and syntax for dynamic language expression. During World War I, he served as an ambulance driver in France and was imprisoned in a detention camp due to suspected disloyalty, an experience that inspired his novel *The Enormous Room* (1922).[1][3][5]

Cummings's career as a poet took off with his first collection, *Tulips and Chimneys* (1923), showcasing his signature eccentric grammar, punctuation, typography, and lower-case spellings. He published around 2,900 poems across twelve volumes, along with plays like *HIM* (1927), essays, and travelogues such as *EIMI* (1933) on the Soviet Union. Dividing time between Paris, where he studied art, and New York, he experimented with form, spacing, and syntax to mimic emotional energy, earning recognition as an avant-garde modernist. Despite personal tragedies like his father's death and a failed marriage, he continued writing until his death on September 3, 1962, in North Conway, New Hampshire.[1][2][3]

Cummings's legacy endures as one of 20th-century America's most innovative poets, celebrated for free-form poetry that challenged norms and emphasized individualism against 'mostpeople.' His work influenced modernist literature, and he remains popular for pieces like 'i carry your heart with me.' Though primarily literary, his spoken word presence on platforms like Spotify reflects his performative readings, often delivered despite arthritis in his later years.[1][2][5]
