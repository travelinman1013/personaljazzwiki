## Biography
Henry 'Hank' Jones Jr., born on July 31, 1918, in Vicksburg, Mississippi, and raised in Pontiac, Michigan, began playing piano as a teenager, drawing early inspiration from Art Tatum after moving through cities like Cleveland and Buffalo. He relocated to New York City in 1944, joining Oran 'Hot Lips' Page's band, and quickly immersed himself in bebop, recording with Charlie Parker and working with bandleaders such as John Kirby, Coleman Hawkins, Andy Kirk, Billy Eckstine, and Howard McGhee. From 1947 to 1951, he toured with Norman Granz's Jazz at the Philharmonic, then served as Ella Fitzgerald's accompanist from 1948 to 1953, honing a sophisticated harmonic style blending classical, gospel, and jazz elements.[1][2][3][6]

## Fun Facts
- The Great Jazz Trio's name was coined by East Wind Records A&R in 1976, not by Jones himself, despite its prominent members including Miles Davis Quintet alumni Ron Carter and Tony Williams.[1][5]
- Jones was the oldest of three musical brothers, including cornetist Thad and drummer Elvin, and their first recorded collaboration since 1963 was Flowers for Lady Day in the late 1990s.[2]
- He became Savoy Records' house pianist in the late 1940s, recording a acclaimed trio album in 1955 with Wendell Marshall and Kenny Clarke.[1]
- Jones worked as a studio musician for CBS from the 1950s to 1974, which paused his jazz prominence until his prolific comeback with the Great Jazz Trio.[2][8]
