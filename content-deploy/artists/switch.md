## Biography
Switch is a contemporary Christian music collective based in the Oklahoma City area, formed by worship pastors from Life.Church, a multi-site church with locations across ten states and a global online presence[1][4][6]. The group originated in 2018 as an extension of Life.Church's student ministry, also named Switch, with the goal of creating modern worship music that resonates with young listeners and encourages a personal relationship with Jesus[4]. Their debut EP, 'Symphony,' released in early 2019, quickly gained traction, with the title track earning over 525,000 streams in its first week and dominating the Billboard Christian Hot AC/CHR Chart for 13 consecutive weeks[4][6]. Switch was subsequently named Billboard's Top New Christian Artist of 2019, marking a significant milestone in their career[6].

Musically, Switch blends elements of Christian rock, modern worship, and Top 40 pop, crafting songs that are both lyrically profound and melodically accessible[1][4]. Their music is designed to inspire faith and perseverance, with tracks like 'Count Me In' serving as anthems of hope and resilience for listeners facing adversity[1]. The group’s collaborative approach, rooted in their shared ministry and church community, has fostered a unique sound that appeals to both students and adults, extending their influence beyond the church walls[4].

Switch’s legacy is defined by their commitment to creating music that supports Life.Church’s mission of leading people to become fully devoted followers of Christ. Their songs have become a source of comfort and encouragement for many, reflecting the belief that faith can bring peace amid chaos. With continued releases and a growing audience, Switch remains a prominent force in the Christian music landscape, inspiring listeners to embrace their faith journey[1][4][6].
