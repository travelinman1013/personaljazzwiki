## Biography
The Ethiopians were one of Jamaica's most celebrated harmony groups, formed in 1963 in Kingston, Jamaica, at the tail end of the ska period. Founded by Leonard Dillon (born December 9, 1942, in Port Antonio, Jamaica) alongside Stephen "Tough Cock" Taylor and Aston "Charlie" Morrison, the group became instrumental in bridging the musical evolution from ska through rocksteady to early reggae. The Ethiopians achieved significant commercial and critical success between the mid-1960s and early 1970s, establishing themselves as one of the first Jamaican acts to perform extensively in Britain, thereby helping to introduce Caribbean music to international audiences.

The group's vocal harmonies and musical versatility made them standout performers across multiple genres during Jamaica's most creatively fertile period. Their ability to adapt to the changing sounds of Jamaican popular music—from the upbeat rhythms of ska to the slower, more soulful rocksteady style and eventually to reggae—demonstrated their artistic range and cultural significance. The Ethiopians remained active throughout the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, and into the 2010s, maintaining their influence on reggae music and continuing to perform and record during their extended career.

Leonard Dillon, the group's founder and frontman, passed away on September 28, 2011, marking the end of an era for one of Jamaica's most important vocal groups. The Ethiopians' legacy endures as a testament to the golden age of Jamaican popular music, and their contributions to ska, rocksteady, and reggae continue to be recognized and celebrated by music historians and reggae enthusiasts worldwide.
