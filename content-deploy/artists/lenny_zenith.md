## Biography
Lenny Zenith is a pioneering transgender musician, songwriter, and activist, born in New Orleans, Louisiana, to a Cuban mother and an American father, both musicians. Surrounded by music from an early age—his father was a violinist and his mother a singer—Zenith began performing and writing songs as a child. He transitioned in junior high during the 1970s, a time when transgender visibility was rare, and attended the New Orleans Center for the Creative Arts (NOCCA), which counts jazz luminaries among its alumni. After moving to California with his father, Zenith continued to pursue music, eventually returning to New Orleans to form the punk-pop band RZA, which opened for legendary acts such as U2, Iggy Pop, Gang of Four, and The Replacements.

Throughout the 1990s, Zenith led the critically acclaimed New York City noise-pop band Jenifer Convertible, collaborating with notable producers like James Murphy (pre-LCD Soundsystem) and Wharton Tiers (Sonic Youth, Dinosaur Jr.). Despite coming close to a major label deal, industry hesitancy over his gender identity stalled mainstream breakthrough. Zenith’s solo career flourished with the release of his 2018 album 'What If The Sun,' earning praise from outlets like Billboard and Atwood Magazine. His music, blending power-pop, indie pop, post-punk, and elements of jazz and rockabilly, is marked by candid lyricism about identity and resilience. Zenith’s legacy is cemented as one of rock’s first openly transgender stars, a trailblazer for LGBTQ+ visibility in music.
