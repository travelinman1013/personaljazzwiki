## Biography
Dan Romer and Benh Zeitlin are a celebrated composer-director duo best known for their evocative, genre-blending film scores. Dan Romer, a Brooklyn-born, Grammy-winning music producer, initially made his mark in the pop and indie music scenes, producing for artists like Christina Aguilera and Shawn Mendes. He transitioned into film scoring during his college years, where he met Benh Zeitlin, a New York City native and Wesleyan University graduate. Zeitlin, who grew up staging puppet shows and making home movies, developed a passion for epic, handcrafted storytelling, which he carried into his filmmaking career.

Their collaboration began with the short film 'Glory at Sea' and reached international acclaim with the score for Zeitlin's debut feature, 'Beasts of the Southern Wild.' Their music, characterized by a blend of Cajun folk, Americana, and orchestral elements, became integral to the film's emotional landscape and critical success. Zeitlin and Romer’s creative process is notably hands-on and improvisational, often involving marathon recording sessions and a deep, intuitive exchange of musical ideas. They continued their partnership on projects like 'Wendy' and 'A Chiara,' further refining their unique sonic language.

The legacy of Romer and Zeitlin’s partnership lies in their ability to merge narrative and music into a cohesive, emotionally resonant whole. Their scores are recognized for their inventiveness and for amplifying the handmade, mythic qualities of Zeitlin’s films, influencing a new generation of filmmakers and composers interested in blending folk traditions with cinematic storytelling.
