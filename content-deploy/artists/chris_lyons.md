## Biography
Chris Lyons is an American musician, songwriter, and guitarist best known as the frontman and principal songwriter for the New Orleans-based band Silver Synthetic. Originally active in the garage punk scene with the band Bottomfeeders, Lyons transitioned toward a more melodic, classic rock-influenced sound, leading to the formation of Silver Synthetic in 2017. Seeking to explore material that didn't fit his previous band's style, Lyons collaborated with Prakash, a versatile guitarist, to shape a new musical direction that blended elements of rock, pop, and alt-country.

Lyons's approach to songwriting is characterized by a focus on catchy melodies, tight guitar interplay, and a reverence for the storytelling traditions of classic rock and alt-country. Silver Synthetic's self-titled debut album, released on Third Man Records, showcases this style, with arrangements that honor the band's live sound and emphasize organic musicianship. Lyons's work has been praised for its subtle complexity and its ability to evoke the spirit of bands like Big Star and The Kinks, while maintaining a contemporary sensibility.

Through his work with Silver Synthetic and previous projects, Lyons has contributed to the vibrant New Orleans music scene, helping to bridge the gap between garage rock energy and classic songwriting craft. His legacy is marked by a commitment to collaboration and a dedication to evolving his musical voice within the alt-country and rock genres.
