## Biography
Timothy McNealy is a soul and funk singer, songwriter, producer, and bandleader from Dallas, Texas, whose small but powerful body of work from the late 1960s and early 1970s has become legendary among deep funk collectors and DJs.[1][2][6] Based in Dallas, he first came to local prominence playing with Bobby Patterson & The Mustangs in the 1960s, cutting his teeth in the city’s vibrant R&B club scene before stepping out on his own.[6] Determined to control his music and its presentation, McNealy founded his own label, Shawn Records, through which he self‑financed and issued a handful of 7-inch singles rather than full albums—a choice that contributed both to the rarity and mystique of his output.[2]

McNealy’s best‑known recording, the 1970s single **“Sagittarius Black,”** became one of the key records of the 1990s deep funk revival when it was rediscovered by collectors and DJs searching for obscure American funk sides from the late ’60s and early ’70s.[2] Its heavy groove, raw horns, and psychedelic edge exemplify his style: tight, rhythm‑driven funk and soul colored by idiosyncratic arrangements and an intensely personal vision rooted in Dallas’s musical milieu.[2][3] Although he released only a few rare 45s at the time, later compilations—most notably **“Funky Movement,”** the first full-length anthology of his work—revealed the breadth of his recordings and solidified his status as a major, if previously under‑recognized, figure in Texas funk, standing alongside Houston’s Kashmere Stage Band and San Antonio’s Mickey and the Soul Generation as emblematic of their respective city scenes.[2][3]

Today, McNealy’s once-obscure catalog is celebrated as a crucial document of Dallas funk and soul, offering a snapshot of local talent and independent creativity at a peak moment in American groove‑based music.[2] His work, long circulated mainly via rare original pressings and DJ culture, has been reintroduced to new audiences through official reissues and inclusion on compilations such as *Cold Heat*, *Texas Funk*, and *South Dallas Pop Fest 1970*, which place his recordings in the broader narrative of regional American funk history.[2] Though biographical details about his later life remain sparse, the enduring fascination with his music—and the lengths to which collectors once went to obtain his records—attest to his lasting legacy as one of Texas funk’s most distinctive and enigmatic voices.[2][7]

## Fun Facts
- Timothy McNealy released his original records through his own self‑funded label, Shawn Records, which helped keep creative control in his hands but also made his 45s extremely scarce and collectible.[2]
- His track “Sagittarius Black” was so rare and mysterious when rediscovered in the 1990s deep funk scene that collectors initially knew almost nothing about who he was or how many records he had made.[2][7]
- For decades, McNealy was known almost entirely through a few elusive 7-inch singles; the first-ever full-length collection of his work, “Funky Movement,” only appeared many years later as an anthology.[2][3]
- McNealy is now regarded as a flagship representative of Dallas funk and soul in the same way that Kashmere Stage Band represents Houston and Mickey and the Soul Generation represents San Antonio, giving each of Texas’s major cities its own iconic funk ambassador.[2]
