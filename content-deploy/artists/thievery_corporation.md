## Biography
Thievery Corporation is an American electronic music duo formed in Washington, D.C. in 1995 by Rob Garza and Eric Hilton. The group emerged from the vibrant nightlife and eclectic music scene centered around the Eighteenth Street Lounge, where Garza and Hilton bonded over their shared love of club culture and diverse musical genres such as dub, bossa nova, reggae, jazz, and electronic dance music. Their debut album, 'Sounds from the Thievery Hi-Fi' (1996), established their reputation as pioneers of song-based electronic music, blending global influences with a lounge aesthetic. Over the years, Thievery Corporation has released a dozen acclaimed studio albums, remix collections, and concert recordings, consistently pushing boundaries and incorporating a wide array of international sounds and vocalists.

Musically, Thievery Corporation is known for their genre-defying style, which fuses trip-hop, downtempo, acid jazz, and lounge with elements of Indian classical, Brazilian, and Middle Eastern music. Their production approach emphasizes inclusion and experimentation, drawing from secondhand record stores and live collaborations with musicians from around the world. The band’s legacy includes defining a sub-genre of electronic music and influencing a generation of artists with their cosmopolitan sound and DIY ethos. Their music has been recognized for its social and political commentary, and they have performed to enthusiastic audiences across five continents.
