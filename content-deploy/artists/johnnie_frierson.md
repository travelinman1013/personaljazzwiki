## Biography
Johnnie Frierson (June 25, 1945 – April 20, 2010) was a soul and gospel singer-songwriter from Memphis, Tennessee, whose musical career spanned from the mid-1960s to the mid-1990s.[3] He began his musical journey at a young age, joining the gospel group the Sunset Travelers before forming The Drapels with his sister in his early twenties.[1][4] Working with Stax Records, one of the most influential record labels on the Memphis soul scene, Frierson emerged as a promising young soul singer with a distinctive voice and genuine emotional depth.[1] His early career showed considerable promise, and he performed locally, selling his tapes to audiences who connected with his authentic artistry.

Beyond his musical pursuits, Frierson was deeply involved in the Memphis Civil Rights movement during the late 1960s, joining the Invaders, a radical Black nationalist group modeled after the Black Panthers, which led to his placement on an FBI watch list.[1] He was subsequently drafted into the Vietnam War, after which he returned to Memphis and continued writing music, primarily for other artists.[1] Frierson also created educational videos on mathematics, English, reading, social studies, science, and history that he sold to parents across Memphis, demonstrating his multifaceted talents and commitment to community education.[1] Despite his schizophrenia diagnosis, which began after his return from Vietnam, Frierson remained creatively prolific throughout his life.[1]

Frierson's most enduring legacy comes from his home recordings, particularly the album 'Have You Been Good to Yourself,' which he recorded in a shed using only a guitar and a regular tape recorder.[1] These ultra-rare cassette recordings, featuring a mix of spoken word and gospel songs rooted in his Church of God In Christ upbringing, were discovered in 2015 by vintage dealer Jameson Sweiger in a Memphis thrift store—five years after Frierson's death.[1][7] The intimate and emotionally raw nature of these recordings has resonated deeply with listeners, earning them recognition as some of the most authentic and moving soul music from the Memphis tradition, despite their obscure origins and limited initial distribution.[1]
