## Biography
Sheer Mag is a Philadelphia-based band formed in 2014 by vocalist Christina (Tina) Halladay, guitarist Matt Palmer, and brothers Kyle (guitar) and Hart Seely (bass), all of whom met through the vibrant music scene at SUNY Purchase, a public arts college in New York. After graduating, the founding members relocated to Philadelphia, where they lived together in a row house dubbed 'The Nuthouse,' hosting DIY punk gigs and recording their earliest material. Their debut 7-inch, self-released in 2014, quickly garnered attention for its raw, lo-fi sound and energetic blend of 1970s arena rock, power pop, and proto-metal influences, all filtered through a modern, socially conscious lens.

From the outset, Sheer Mag distinguished themselves by fiercely guarding their independence, releasing music on their own terms and declining offers from major indie labels. Their early EPs and relentless touring on the Northeastern DIY circuit built a cult following, with critics and fans alike drawn to their combination of gritty, analog production and Halladay's powerhouse vocals. The band’s debut album, 'Need to Feel Your Love' (2017), deepened their reputation for pairing classic rock riffs with pointed political commentary, addressing topics such as the Stonewall Riots, redlining, and historical activism. Subsequent releases, including 'A Distant Call' (2019), have continued this trajectory, cementing Sheer Mag as a vital force in contemporary rock.

Sheer Mag’s legacy lies in their ability to reclaim the swagger and immediacy of classic rock without its toxic baggage, offering anthems that channel both personal struggle and broader social issues. Their DIY ethos, refusal to conform to industry expectations, and commitment to community have inspired a new generation of musicians seeking authenticity and autonomy in an ever-commercialized landscape.

## Fun Facts

- Sheer Mag has never hired a manager or run a Twitter account, further emphasizing their commitment to DIY ethics and independence.
