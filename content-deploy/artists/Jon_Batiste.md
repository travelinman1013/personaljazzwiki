## Biography
Jon Batiste is a celebrated American musician, composer, and bandleader born on November 11, 1986, in Metairie, Louisiana. Raised in Kenner, he belongs to the storied Batiste family, a New Orleans musical dynasty whose members have shaped the city's jazz and brass band traditions for generations. He began his musical journey playing drums with the Batiste Brothers Band at age eight, later switching to piano at eleven under the guidance of local teacher Shirley Herstein. Batiste's early influences included transcribing video game music and absorbing the vibrant sounds of New Orleans.

Batiste attended the New Orleans Center for Creative Arts and graduated in 2004, then moved to New York City to study at the Juilliard School, earning both a Bachelor and Master of Music in jazz studies. His career quickly flourished, with performances in over 40 countries and appearances at prestigious venues such as Carnegie Hall, Lincoln Center, and the Concertgebouw. He founded and leads the band Stay Human, known for its energetic street performances and as the house band for 'The Late Show with Stephen Colbert' from 2015 to 2022. Batiste's musical style fuses jazz, soul, R&B, gospel, and pop, characterized by improvisational flair and a commitment to social engagement through music.

Batiste's legacy includes a string of acclaimed albums, such as 'We Are' (2021), which won five Grammy Awards including Album of the Year, and his Oscar-winning score for Pixar's 'Soul' (2020), making him only the second Black composer to win an Academy Award for composition. His work as an educator, humanitarian, and cultural ambassador has inspired countless musicians, and his boundary-breaking approach continues to expand the possibilities of contemporary music.
