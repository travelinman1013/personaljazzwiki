## Biography
Russell Gunn is an acclaimed American jazz trumpeter, composer, and bandleader, born in Chicago in 1971 and raised in East St. Louis, Illinois. Gunn's early musical interests were rooted in hip-hop, inspired by artists like LL Cool J and Rakim, but he began playing trumpet at age 10, influenced by his cousin and school band director. He attended Jackson State University on a full music scholarship, where he further developed his craft before moving to St. Louis and later New York City, where his career accelerated after being discovered by saxophonist Oliver Lake.

Gunn quickly became known for his dynamic style, blending hard bop jazz with elements of hip-hop, funk, neo-soul, and blues. His groundbreaking 'Ethnomusicology' series, particularly Volumes 1 and 2, melded hip-hop rhythms and jazz improvisation, earning Grammy nominations and establishing him as a leading innovator in contemporary jazz. Gunn has led numerous ensembles, most notably the Royal Krunk Jazz Orkestra, and has performed with influential artists such as Wynton Marsalis, Branford Marsalis, and D’Angelo. His work is characterized by a commitment to authenticity and a refusal to separate his influences from his creative output.

Throughout his career, Gunn has released over 20 albums as a leader and contributed as a sideman to many others. He is recognized for his impact on the next generation of jazz musicians, both through his recordings and his mentorship. Now based in Atlanta, Gunn continues to push boundaries with ambitious projects, including large-scale commissions and collaborations with artists across genres, solidifying his legacy as a bridge between jazz tradition and modern black musical forms.
