## Biography
Counting Crows is an American rock band formed in 1991 in Berkeley, California, by vocalist Adam Duritz and guitarist David Bryson, who initially performed as an acoustic duo in the San Francisco Bay Area[1][3]. The band quickly expanded, adding members such as keyboardist Charlie Gillingham, bassist Matt Malley, and drummer Steve Bowman, and developed a strong local following before signing with Geffen Records[1][5]. Their debut album, *August and Everything After* (1993), produced by T Bone Burnett, became a massive commercial and critical success, propelled by the hit single "Mr. Jones" and eventually selling over seven million copies in the U.S. alone[1][2][4]. The band's sound is characterized by Duritz's emotive, introspective lyrics and distinctive vocal delivery, drawing comparisons to classic rock acts like Van Morrison and The Band[1]. Over the years, Counting Crows have released multiple successful albums, including *Recovering the Satellites* (1996), *This Desert Life* (1999), and *Hard Candy* (2002), and have sold more than 20 million records worldwide[6]. They are also known for their dynamic live performances and have remained a prominent touring act for over two decades[6]. In 2004, the band earned an Academy Award nomination for their song "Accidentally in Love" from *Shrek 2*[6]. Their legacy endures as one of the defining alternative rock bands of the 1990s and early 2000s, with a reputation for heartfelt songwriting and musical craftsmanship.

## Fun Facts

- Before fame, Duritz and Bryson co-owned a small recording studio in Emeryville, CA, where they recorded prolifically, often giving out different demo tapes at each gig[5].
- Counting Crows' debut album, *August and Everything After*, was one of the best-selling albums of 1994, despite being released in late 1993[1][2].
- The band's 2004 single "Accidentally in Love" from *Shrek 2* earned them an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song[6].
