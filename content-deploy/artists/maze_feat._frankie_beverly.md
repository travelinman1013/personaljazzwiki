## Biography
Maze featuring Frankie Beverly is an iconic American soul and funk band founded by Frankie Beverly in Philadelphia in 1970. Beverly, born in Philadelphia in 1946, began his musical journey singing doo-wop as a teenager and formed several groups, including The Butlers, before establishing Maze. The band originally performed under the name Raw Soul and relocated to San Francisco in the early 1970s, where they were introduced to Marvin Gaye. Gaye became a mentor, taking the group on tour as his opening act and suggesting the name change to Maze. Their debut album, 'Maze Featuring Frankie Beverly,' was released in 1977, launching a string of R&B hits and earning them a devoted following for their passionate, soulful, and honest sound.[1][2][3][4]

Throughout the 1980s and beyond, Maze released a series of successful albums, including 'Golden Time of Day,' 'Inspiration,' 'Joy and Pain,' and 'We Are One,' each marked by Beverly's smooth vocals and the band's signature blend of classic soul, quiet storm, and funk. Their live performances became legendary, capturing audiences with electrifying energy and heartfelt musicianship. Beverly served as the group's principal songwriter, arranger, and producer, shaping Maze's distinctive style and overseeing its creative direction. The band's influence extended internationally, and they continued to headline major festivals and tours for decades.[1][3][6]

Maze's legacy is defined by their enduring appeal and impact on soul and R&B music. Beverly's commitment to authenticity and emotional depth set the group apart from contemporaries, and their music has inspired generations of artists. After Beverly's retirement in 2023, the band transitioned to 'Maze Honoring Frankie Beverly,' ensuring the continuation of their storied tradition.[3][6]
