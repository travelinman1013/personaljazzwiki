## Biography
Taj Mahal, born Henry Saint Clair Fredericks on May 17, 1942, in New York City, is a pioneering American blues musician renowned for his innovative fusion of traditional blues with global musical influences. Raised in Springfield, Massachusetts, in a musically rich family—his father was an Afro-Caribbean jazz arranger and pianist, and his mother sang gospel—Mahal was exposed to a wide array of sounds from an early age. The tragic loss of his father at age 11 deepened his connection to music, and he soon began learning guitar, piano, harmonica, and other instruments, drawing inspiration from both his family and the diverse records and radio broadcasts he encountered.

While studying agriculture at the University of Massachusetts Amherst in the early 1960s, Mahal immersed himself in the roots of African American music, particularly acoustic blues. Adopting the stage name 'Taj Mahal' after a vivid dream, he formed his first band and became active in the folk and blues revival scene, including attending the Newport Folk Festival. In 1965, he moved to California and co-founded the influential band Rising Sons with Ry Cooder, one of the first interracial bands signed to a major label. Over his six-decade career, Mahal has released dozens of albums, blending blues with Caribbean, African, and South Pacific traditions, and has collaborated with artists worldwide. His work has earned him three Grammy Awards, induction into the Blues Hall of Fame, and a 2024 induction into the Folk Americana Roots Hall of Fame.

Taj Mahal's musical style is characterized by its deep respect for blues traditions and its adventurous incorporation of global rhythms and melodies. He is celebrated not only as a performer but also as a musical scholar and mentor, credited with revitalizing the blues for new generations and inspiring countless musicians across genres. His enduring legacy is marked by his ability to honor the past while continually expanding the boundaries of American roots music.
