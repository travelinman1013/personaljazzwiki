## Biography
Earnest Jackson is a New Orleans-based singer-songwriter known for his work in the funk and blues genres during the 1970s. In 1973, he achieved a #22 US Billboard Hot 100 hit with a cover of Al Green's 'Love and Happiness,' but received only a one-time fee of $150, missing out on royalties and feeling exploited by the music industry. This experience led him to largely abandon music, working as a waiter for 30 years while success eluded him.[1]

In 1975, amid the economic challenges of stagflation, Jackson composed 'Inflation' to express frustrations with rising costs and low wages. He collaborated with the instrumental funk band Sugar Daddy and the Gumbo Roux, based in Baton Rouge, recording a demo at Sea-Saint Studios in New Orleans. The track remained unreleased for decades after the band disbanded, though band members like keyboardist Kinny Landrum preserved a cassette copy.[1][2][3]

The song gained renewed attention in 2022 when Landrum contacted NPR's Planet Money, prompting them to form Planet Money Records solely to release 'Inflation' and promote Jackson's work. This effort highlighted his raw funk style addressing timeless economic issues, giving him a belated platform while bandmates pursued successful music careers.[1][2]

## Fun Facts
- NPR's Planet Money created a record label called Planet Money Records specifically to release Jackson's 1975 demo 'Inflation' in 2022, marking their first foray into music distribution.[2]
- The 'Inflation' demo was recorded at the legendary Sea-Saint Studios in New Orleans but languished unreleased for 47 years until economic conditions made its lyrics relevant again.[1][2]
- Jackson's 1973 cover of 'Love and Happiness' hit #22 on the Billboard Hot 100, but he was paid just $150 as a one-time fee with no royalties.[1]
