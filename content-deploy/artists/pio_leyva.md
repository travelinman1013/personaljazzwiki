## Biography
Pío Leyva, born Wilfredo Pascual Leyva on May 5, 1917, in Morón, Cuba, was a renowned Cuban singer and songwriter. He began his musical journey at a young age, winning a bongo contest at six and starting his singing career in 1932 with Juanito Blez's band Conjunto Caribe. Over the years, Leyva performed with several notable bands, including the Orquesta de Jesús Montago and the Sexteto Colón. By the late 1950s, he was based in Havana, working with major figures like Bebo Valdés and Compay Segundo. Leyva was celebrated for his improvisational skills as a montunero sonero, known for his ability to extemporize. He recorded over 25 albums and was famous for songs like 'El Mentiroso' and 'Francisco Guayabal.' His music career spanned decades, with appearances on television and tours across Spanish-speaking countries. Although not directly involved in Ry Cooder's Buena Vista Social Club album, Leyva was associated with the broader movement, contributing to related projects like Juan De Marcos' Afro-Cuban All Stars. He passed away on March 22, 2006, at the age of 88. Leyva's legacy is marked by his contributions to Cuban son music and his role in reviving interest in traditional Cuban music through his collaborations and performances. His deep, country voice and improvisational skills made him a beloved figure in Cuban music history.
