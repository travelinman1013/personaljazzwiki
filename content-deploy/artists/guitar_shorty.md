## Biography
Guitar Shorty, born David William Kearney on September 8, 1934, in Houston, Texas, was an American blues guitarist, singer, and songwriter who became a legendary figure in the blues world. He grew up mainly in Kissimmee, Florida, where he learned guitar from his uncle at an early age. At age 16, while performing with the Walter Johnson Orchestra in Tampa Bay, he received his iconic nickname when "Guitar Shorty" mysteriously appeared on the club marquee—a name that would define his career for over six decades. He quickly gained recognition among his peers and joined the Ray Charles Band, recording his first single "You Don't Treat Me Right" in 1957 under the direction of Willie Dixon for the Cobra label.

Throughout the late 1950s and 1960s, Guitar Shorty performed extensively up and down the west coast and Canada, establishing himself as a distinctive force in blues music. His explosive guitar style and wild stage antics set him apart from contemporaries, earning him a reputation for unpredictable, off-the-wall playing that other blues musicians wouldn't attempt. During the 1970s, he worked as a mechanic while playing music nights and weekends, but returned to full-time performing in 1975. His career experienced a major resurgence following a British tour that led to his 1991 album "My Way Or The Highway" on the JSP label, which won the Blues Music Award for Contemporary Foreign Blues Album Of The Year and revitalized his U.S. career. His 2004 Alligator Records debut "Watch Your Back" further cemented his status as a blues heavyweight, and he continued touring extensively until his death on April 20, 2022.

Guitar Shorty's legacy extends beyond his own prolific recordings and performances; he is credited with directly influencing two of blues and rock music's greatest guitarists. His blistering, physical guitar playing and fierce vocals earned him comparisons to a "bare knuckled boxer," while critics praised his harmonically saturated tone, soaring sustain, and lethal licks. Over five decades of performances, he demonstrated an uncompromising artistic vision and became recognized as a true, undisputed heavyweight champion of the blues.
