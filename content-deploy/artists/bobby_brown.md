## Biography
Bobby Brown, born Robert Barisford Brown on February 5, 1969, in Roxbury, Boston, Massachusetts, is an American singer, songwriter, rapper, and dancer recognized as a pioneer of the new jack swing genre—a fusion of hip-hop and R&B. Brown's musical aspirations began in childhood, inspired by seeing James Brown perform at age three[3][5]. He co-founded the R&B/pop group New Edition in 1981 with friends Ricky Bell, Michael Bivins, and Ralph Tresvant, later joined by Ronnie DeVoe. The group achieved early success with hits like 'Candy Girl,' 'Cool It Now,' and 'Mr. Telephone Man,' becoming crossover pop sensations in the mid-1980s[2][3][4].

Brown left New Edition in 1985 amid internal tensions and launched a solo career. His debut album, 'King of Stage' (1986), featured the R&B chart-topping single 'Girlfriend,' but it was his second album, 'Don't Be Cruel' (1988), that catapulted him to stardom. The album produced five Billboard Hot 100 top 10 singles, including the number one hit 'My Prerogative' and the Grammy Award-winning 'Every Little Step.' Brown's energetic, sexually charged performances and innovative sound helped define the new jack swing era, earning him comparisons to Michael Jackson[2][3][4].

Brown's legacy extends beyond his solo success; he contributed to the Ghostbusters II soundtrack, collaborated with prominent producers, and influenced a generation of R&B and pop artists. His high-profile marriage to Whitney Houston and subsequent personal struggles kept him in the public eye, but his impact on contemporary R&B and pop remains significant, with his style and stage presence inspiring artists well into the 21st century[2][3][1].
