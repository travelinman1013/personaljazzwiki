## Biography
Bobby Freeman, born Robert Thomas Freeman on June 13, 1940, in San Francisco, California, emerged as one of the city’s earliest and most influential rock and R&B artists. Growing up in the Bay Area, Freeman attended Mission High School and began his musical journey as a teenager, forming the doo-wop group the Romancers. The group recorded for Dootone Records in 1956 before disbanding, after which Freeman founded the West Coast Vocaleers. His big break came when he wrote and recorded 'Do You Want to Dance,' a song that soared to No. 5 on the Billboard charts in 1958, making him a national sensation while still a teenager.[1][2][3]

Freeman’s energetic blend of doo-wop, rockabilly, and R&B defined his style, and he became a fixture on the touring circuit, performing with legends like Fats Domino, the Coasters, and Jackie Wilson. After a stint with King Records, Freeman returned to the charts in 1964 with 'C’mon and Swim,' a dance craze hit co-written and produced by a young Sylvester Stewart (later known as Sly Stone). Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Freeman was a regular performer at San Francisco’s Condor Club and remained a beloved figure on the Northern California club scene, even as his commercial success waned. His music, particularly 'Do You Want to Dance,' has been widely covered and remains a staple of American pop culture.[1][2][3]

Freeman’s legacy endures through his pioneering role in West Coast rock and R&B, his influence on the dance music of the 1960s, and the enduring popularity of his signature songs. He passed away on January 23, 2017, in Daly City, California, but his joyful, danceable sound continues to inspire generations of musicians and fans.[1][2]
