## Biography
Dave Jordan is an award-winning roots rock singer-songwriter and bandleader from New Orleans, Louisiana, whose career has spanned nearly three decades. Born on January 29, 1972, in Mandeville, Louisiana, Jordan grew up immersed in the rich musical and cultural traditions of south Louisiana, which deeply influenced his songwriting and performance style. His early exposure to the region’s musical melting pot, combined with a family background steeped in writing and storytelling, set the stage for his lifelong passion for music and narrative.

Jordan first gained recognition as the founder, bassist, and lead singer of the funk band Juice, which was active from the mid-1990s through the late 2000s. Juice was a key player in the resurgence of New Orleans funk, sharing the scene with contemporaries like Galactic and All That. After Juice, Jordan reinvented himself as a solo artist, embracing a sound that blends Americana, New Orleans funk, country, and rock. His music has been described as the 'swampy lovechild of Tom Petty, John Prine, and Dr. John,' and he is celebrated for his emotive storytelling and genre-defying approach. Jordan has released five solo albums since 2010, including the acclaimed 'Keep Going' (2022), and is a three-time finalist in OffBeat Magazine’s 'Best of the Beat' awards. He is a fixture at iconic New Orleans venues and festivals, such as Tipitina’s and the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, and has toured extensively across the United States.

Jordan’s legacy is that of a quintessential New Orleans songsmith, weaving together the city’s diverse musical threads into a unique tapestry of American roots music. His collaborations with local legends and his commitment to authentic storytelling have earned him a reputation as one of the great bandleaders and songwriters of his generation.
