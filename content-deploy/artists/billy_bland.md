## Biography
Billy Bland was born on April 5, 1932, in Wilmington, North Carolina, as the youngest of 19 children. Driven by ambition, he moved to New York City at age 18, quickly landing gigs with renowned bandleaders Lionel Hampton and Buddy Johnson in the late 1940s. His early career was marked by versatility and a willingness to experiment musically, though he struggled with consistency and discipline, often moving between jobs.

Bland's breakthrough came in 1954 when Dave Bartholomew discovered him performing at Smalls Paradise in Harlem. Bartholomew brought him to New Orleans, where Bland became the lead singer of The Bees, recording the risqué "Toy Bell" with members of Fats Domino's band. After The Bees disbanded, Bland signed with Old Town Records in 1956, where his music spanned R&B, blues, doo-wop, pop ballads, and rock and roll. His biggest hit, "Let the Little Girl Dance," released in 1960, reached the national top ten and showcased his energetic vocal style and adaptability. Bland continued recording through the early 1960s, earning brief chart success with several singles before retiring from music.

Billy Bland's legacy lies in his dynamic contributions to the R&B and doo-wop genres, particularly through his innovative vocal performances and genre-crossing repertoire. His work influenced later artists, and his recording of "Toy Bell" indirectly inspired Chuck Berry's chart-topping "My Ding-A-Ling." Bland passed away in New York City on March 22, 2017.
