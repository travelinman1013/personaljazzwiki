## Biography
Cate Le Bon, born Cate Timothy in the early 1980s in Penboyr, Carmarthenshire, Wales, is a Welsh multi-disciplinary artist and producer whose career began in the vibrant Welsh indie scene of the early 2000s[1][2][5]. She adopted her stage name in tribute to Simon Le Bon of Duran Duran[1]. Early on, she was mentored by Gruff Rhys of Super Furry Animals, who offered her an opening slot on their 2007 tour, helping launch her career[1][5]. Her debut album, 'Me Oh My,' was released in 2009/2010, blending folk, psychedelia, and garage rock, and she quickly evolved her sound through subsequent releases like 'Cyrk' and 'Mug Museum,' the latter recorded after relocating to Los Angeles[1][2][4].

Le Bon's music is characterized by its art pop sensibilities: sparse, angular arrangements, sharp guitar melodies, and a surreal, sculptural approach to songwriting[1][2][4]. Her vocals are often compared to Nico, and her compositions frequently shift between melodic hooks and off-kilter rhythms, drawing listeners into intricate emotional landscapes[4]. Over seven albums, including the Mercury Prize-nominated 'Reward' and the acclaimed 'Pompeii,' she has established a reputation for blending analog warmth, filtered vocals, and experimental textures, often collaborating with saxophonist Euan Hinshelwood and co-producer Samur Khouja[2][3].

Le Bon's legacy is marked by her dual role as a solo artist and a sought-after producer, working with acts such as Wilco, Horsegirl, Devendra Banhart, and St. Vincent[2][4]. Her influence extends beyond her own catalog, as she is recognized for her ability to transform sonic environments and inspire a new generation of musicians with her idiosyncratic vision and emotional depth[2][4].
