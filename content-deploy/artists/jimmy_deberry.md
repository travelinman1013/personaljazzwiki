## Biography
Jimmy DeBerry was an American blues guitarist, banjoist, and singer, born on November 17, 1911, in Gumwood, Arkansas. He spent his formative years in Arkansas and Mississippi before moving to Memphis in 1927 to live with his aunt. DeBerry was largely self-taught, beginning with the ukulele and later mastering the banjo and guitar, which became his primary instruments as he immersed himself in the vibrant Memphis blues scene.[3][4][1]

Throughout his career, DeBerry was an active, though somewhat peripheral, figure in the Memphis blues community from the 1920s through the early 1950s. He played with notable musicians such as harmonica player Walter Horton and drummer Willie Nix, and led his own group, the Memphis Playboys. His style blended classic blues with elements of electric Memphis blues, reflecting the evolving sound of the region during his active years.[1][6][5]

Though not as widely recognized as some of his contemporaries, DeBerry's musicianship and collaborations contributed to the rich tapestry of Memphis blues. He continued to perform and record into the later years of his life, passing away on January 17, 1985, in Sikeston, Missouri. His legacy endures through his recordings and the influence he had on the Memphis blues tradition.[4][5]
