## Biography
Kenny Burrell, born July 31, 1931, in Detroit, Michigan, is a seminal figure in jazz guitar, renowned for his lyrical phrasing, harmonic sophistication, and deep roots in both bebop and blues traditions. Growing up in a musically inclined family—his mother played piano and sang, while his father favored banjo and ukulele—Burrell began playing guitar at age 12 and was quickly drawn to the vibrant Detroit jazz scene. He studied composition and theory with Louis Cabara and classical guitar with Joe Fava, later earning a degree in music composition and theory from Wayne State University. While still a student, he made his recording debut in 1951 with Dizzy Gillespie’s sextet, which included John Coltrane and Milt Jackson, and co-founded the New World Music Society collective with Detroit peers such as Pepper Adams and Yusef Lateef.

After graduating in 1955, Burrell toured with Oscar Peterson’s trio before relocating to New York City in 1956 with pianist Tommy Flanagan. There, he quickly became one of the city’s most sought-after guitarists, performing in Broadway pit bands, recording with jazz greats like Billie Holiday, Jimmy Smith, and John Coltrane, and working on pop and R&B sessions with Tony Bennett and Lena Horne. As a leader, Burrell recorded more than 90 albums, including classics like 'Midnight Blue' (1963) with Stanley Turrentine and 'Guitar Forms' (1965) with Gil Evans. He pioneered the guitar-led jazz trio and became a standard-bearer for jazz guitarists worldwide, known for his understated, melodic style and commitment to musical integrity.

Burrell’s influence extends beyond performance; he has been a dedicated educator, serving as a professor and Director of Jazz Studies at UCLA. His legacy is marked by his role in shaping modern jazz guitar, mentoring future generations, and bridging the worlds of jazz, blues, and popular music.
