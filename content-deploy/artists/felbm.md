## Biography
Felbm is the musical project of Dutch producer and instrumentalist Eelco Topper, born in Zwolle, Netherlands and currently based in Utrecht[2][4]. Topper began his musical journey as a child, playing snare drum in a local marching band before moving on to drums and eventually piano, which laid the foundation for his later work[2]. He first gained recognition under the moniker Falco Benz, releasing synthesizer-driven electronic music, but after experiencing creative burnout, he shifted toward a more organic and relaxed approach with Felbm, embracing acoustic instruments and tape recording techniques[1][2][3].

Since debuting as Felbm in 2018 with the Tape series on Soundway Records, Topper has developed a distinctive style that blends acoustic and electronic textures, subtle jazz rhythms, and ambient soundscapes[1][4][6]. His work is deeply inspired by the rhythms and patterns of the natural world, as seen in albums like Elements of Nature (2021), cycli infini (2023), and winterspring/summerfall (2025), which reflect seasonal changes and environmental observations through refined instrumentation and field recordings[4]. Felbm's music has earned international recognition for its gentle, introspective character and its ability to evoke both stillness and movement[4][8].

Felbm's legacy lies in his innovative approach to composition and sound, balancing tradition with experimentation. His live performances often feature collaborations with other musicians, bringing his seasonal and nature-inspired suites to life with ensembles that include piano, double bass, and flute[4][8]. Through his evolving body of work, Felbm continues to influence the ambient and jazz-inflected instrumental music scene, offering listeners a meditative and immersive sonic experience.
