## Biography
Lillian Offitt was born on November 4, 1938, near Nashville, Tennessee. She developed an early interest in music and began to seriously consider a career as a performer while attending Tennessee State University. Initially aspiring to record gospel music, her direction changed when Ernie Young, owner of Nashboro Records, encouraged her to try secular music. This led to her debut single, 'Miss You So,' released on the Excello label in 1957, which climbed to number 8 on the Billboard R&B chart and established her as a promising new voice in classic blues and R&B.

Following her initial success, Offitt moved to Chicago, a major hub for blues music, where she performed in nightclubs and continued to record. She toured with notable artists such as Lowell Fulson and Johnny 'Guitar' Watson and became a featured vocalist with Earl Hooker's band. Her collaborations with Hooker led to a contract with Chief Records, where she recorded several singles, including the regional hit 'Will My Man Be Home Tonight.' Despite her early achievements, her recording career slowed in the 1960s, and she eventually left the music industry to start a family, though she occasionally performed into the 1970s.

Offitt's musical style was characterized by a robust, expressive vocal delivery, typical of the classic blues shouter tradition. Though her recording output was limited, her work remains respected among blues enthusiasts, and her early singles are considered valuable examples of late 1950s and early 1960s urban blues. Her legacy is that of a talented, if under-recognized, figure in the transition from Southern R&B to the Chicago blues scene.
