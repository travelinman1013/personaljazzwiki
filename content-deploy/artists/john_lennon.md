## Biography
John Lennon (born October 9, 1940, Liverpool, England—died December 8, 1980, New York City, U.S.) was a founding member of The Beatles, one of the most influential bands in music history. Raised in Liverpool by his aunt after his parents separated, Lennon formed his first band, the Quarry Men, as a teenager, inspired by early rock and roll artists. The group evolved into The Beatles after Lennon met Paul McCartney in 1957, later joined by George Harrison and Ringo Starr. Under the management of Brian Epstein and the production of George Martin, The Beatles achieved unprecedented global success, pioneering new directions in popular music from the early 1960s until their breakup in 1970.

Lennon's songwriting partnership with McCartney produced a vast catalog of iconic songs, while his own compositions often reflected his wit, introspection, and social consciousness. After The Beatles, Lennon embarked on a solo career marked by experimental work with his wife Yoko Ono and politically charged songs like 'Imagine' and 'Give Peace a Chance.' His music ranged from melodic pop to avant-garde, always marked by a distinct lyrical voice and a willingness to challenge conventions. Lennon’s life was tragically cut short when he was murdered outside his New York apartment in 1980, but his legacy endures through his music and his advocacy for peace and social change.
