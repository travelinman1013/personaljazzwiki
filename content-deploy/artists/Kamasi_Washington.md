## Biography
Kamasi Washington, born February 18, 1981, in Los Angeles, California, was raised in a deeply musical household—his father Rickey is a saxophonist and his mother a flutist—immersing him in jazz from an early age. He began on drums and piano, moved to clarinet at age seven, and ultimately settled on the tenor saxophone at twelve, following in his father's footsteps. Washington attended the Academy of Music at Alexander Hamilton High School, where he joined the Multi-School Jazz Band under teacher Reggie Andrews, connecting with future collaborators like Stephen 'Thundercat' Bruner and Ronald Bruner Jr. He furthered his studies at UCLA, focusing on ethnomusicology and gaining experience with jazz legends such as Kenny Burrell and Billy Higgins[1][3][5][7].

Washington's career accelerated as he became a central figure in the West Coast Get Down collective, recording prolifically and collaborating across genres. He contributed to Kendrick Lamar's Grammy-winning 'To Pimp a Butterfly' and released his own landmark debut, 'The Epic,' in 2015—a three-disc, 172-minute exploration that won the American Music Prize and redefined contemporary jazz. His subsequent works, including 'Harmony of Difference,' 'Heaven and Earth,' and 'Fearless Movement,' have been critically acclaimed, and his score for Michelle Obama's Netflix documentary 'Becoming' earned Emmy and Grammy nominations[1][2][6].

Washington's musical style blends spiritual jazz, post-bop, fusion, and elements from hip-hop, classical, and soul, reflecting his belief in music as a force for connection and social change. He is celebrated for revitalizing jazz for new audiences, both as a solo artist and through collaborations with artists such as Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter, Lauryn Hill, Snoop Dogg, Chaka Khan, and the supergroup Dinner Party. His legacy is marked by a commitment to creative collaboration and innovation, bridging generations and genres[1][4][6].
