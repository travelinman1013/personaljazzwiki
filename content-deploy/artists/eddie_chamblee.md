## Biography
Edwin Leon “Eddie” Chamblee (February 24, 1920 – May 1, 1999) was an American tenor and alto saxophonist, occasional vocalist, and clarinetist whose work bridged swing, early rhythm and blues, and post‑war jazz.[3][5] Born in Atlanta, Georgia, and raised in Chicago from childhood, he began playing saxophone around the age of twelve and developed his craft in the city’s fertile South Side scene.[8][9] While studying law at Chicago State University, he simultaneously pursued music and then served in U.S. Army bands from 1941 to 1946, gaining substantial professional experience during World War II.[2][8]

Returning to Chicago after the war, Chamblee became a key figure in the emerging R&B market when he was featured tenor saxophonist on pianist Sonny Thompson’s 1948 hits “Long Gone” and “Late Freight,” records that were so successful that his nickname “Long Gone” followed him throughout his career.[3][7] He went on to lead his own small groups, recorded for labels such as Miracle, Premium, United, and later Prestige (including the album *The Rocking Tenor Sax of Eddie Chamblee* in the mid‑1960s), and was also a member of the vocal/instrumental group The Four Blazes.[1][7][8] In the 1950s he worked extensively with Dinah Washington—whom he married briefly—both on recordings and in her touring band, further elevating his profile on the national jazz and R&B circuit.[3][8]

Stylistically, Chamblee was known for a robust, blues‑drenched tenor sound that could move from honking, hard‑driving R&B riffs to more refined swing phrasing, reflecting the transitional nature of post‑war Black popular music.[1][4][7] He remained active as a performer into later decades, working in both big‑band and small‑combo contexts and appearing in clubs and on recordings in New York, where he eventually settled and died in 1999.[1][3] Though not as widely remembered as some of his contemporaries, his contributions to early R&B saxophone, his role in classic recordings with Sonny Thompson and Dinah Washington, and his own leader dates have secured him a respected place among mid‑20th‑century American saxophonists.[1][3][7]

## Musical Connections

### Mentors/Influences
- [[chicago_south_side_jazz_and_randb_community|Chicago South Side jazz and R&B community]] - Formative environment in which Chamblee developed his saxophone style after moving from Atlanta to Chicago as a child; he absorbed swing, blues, and emerging R&B idioms from local bands and club scenes. (Early Chicago club performances and pre‑war small‑group work (documented generally rather than via specific titles).) [Mid‑1930s to early 1940s[8][9]]

### Key Collaborators
- [[sonny_thompson|Sonny Thompson]] - Chamblee was the featured tenor saxophonist on Thompson’s breakthrough R&B instrumentals, which became major hits and defined his public nickname “Long Gone.” (Singles “Long Gone” and “Late Freight” and related Thompson band sessions.) [Late 1940s, especially 1948[3][7]]
- [[dinah_washington|Dinah Washington]] - Chamblee performed and recorded extensively in Washington’s band and was briefly married to her, appearing on sessions that blended jazz, blues, and pop material. (Various Mercury recordings with Dinah Washington (late 1940s–1950s) as her saxophonist; specific albums are documented collectively in discographies rather than highlighted individually in the core sources.) [Late 1940s through 1950s[3][8]]
- [[the_four_blazes|The Four Blazes]] - Chamblee was a member of this Chicago‑based vocal and instrumental R&B group, contributing saxophone to their small‑combo sound. (Recordings and performances credited to The Four Blazes on Chicago labels.) [Early to mid‑1950s[1][8]]
- [[prestige_records_house_rhythm_sections|Prestige Records house rhythm sections]] - As a leader on Prestige, Chamblee recorded with contemporary jazz rhythm‑section players in small‑group settings that showcased his “rocking” tenor approach. (Album *The Rocking Tenor Sax of Eddie Chamblee* and associated sessions.) [Mid‑1960s (session issued 1964)[7]]

### Artists Influenced
- [[postwar_randb_and_rock_and_roll_tenor_sax_stylists_general|Post‑war R&B and rock & roll tenor sax stylists (general)]] - Chamblee’s work on early R&B hits like “Long Gone” and “Late Freight” helped define the honking, blues‑based tenor style that became a template for later R&B and early rock saxophonists, even if specific named protégés are not documented in the main sources. (Influence traceable particularly to his solos on “Long Gone,” “Late Freight,” and his own leader sides in the late 1940s and 1950s.) [Late 1940s onward (influence on 1950s–1960s players)[3][4][7]]
