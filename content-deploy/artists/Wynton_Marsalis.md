## Biography
Wynton Marsalis, born October 18, 1961, in New Orleans, Louisiana, is a celebrated American trumpeter, composer, bandleader, and educator. Raised in a musical family—his father, Ellis Marsalis Jr., was a renowned pianist and teacher—Wynton was exposed to both jazz and classical music from an early age. He received his first trumpet at age six but began serious study at twelve, attending the New Orleans Center for Creative Arts and later the prestigious Juilliard School in New York. Marsalis made his mark as a prodigious talent, performing with Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers soon after arriving in New York.

Marsalis's career is distinguished by his dual mastery of jazz and classical music. He is the only artist to have won Grammy Awards in both genres in the same year, a feat he accomplished in 1983 and 1984. As the artistic director of Jazz at Lincoln Center, Marsalis has been a driving force in jazz education and advocacy, leading ensembles, composing major works such as the Pulitzer Prize-winning oratorio 'Blood on the Fields,' and mentoring countless young musicians. His musical style is rooted in the jazz tradition, emphasizing swing, improvisation, and the blues, while also embracing the technical rigor of classical trumpet performance.

Over four decades, Marsalis has released over 120 recordings, revitalized interest in jazz worldwide, and championed its cultural significance. His influence extends beyond performance to composition, education, and public advocacy, ensuring the continued vitality and evolution of jazz as an American art form.
