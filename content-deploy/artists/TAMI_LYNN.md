## Biography
Tami Lynn, born Gloria Jean Brown on January 25, 1939, in Gert Town, New Orleans, emerged from a vibrant musical environment, attending school with future jazz legends Allen Toussaint and Ellis Marsalis Jr. She began singing spirituals with the Clara Ward Singers and appeared on local gospel radio, where Mahalia Jackson recognized her talent early on. Lynn's professional break came when she substituted for a missing performer at the Joy Tavern, leading to her discovery by Alvin 'Red' Tyler and a contract with AFO Records. Under the mentorship of Tyler, Harold Battiste, and Melvin Lastie, she toured with the AFO band and performed at prestigious venues like Birdland in New York, opening for jazz greats such as John Coltrane, Miles Davis, and Ella Fitzgerald.

Her recording career took off after Jerry Wexler of Atlantic Records signed her, resulting in the 1965 recording of 'I'm Gonna Run Away From You.' Though initially unreleased in the US, the song became a Northern Soul classic in the UK after its 1971 reissue, reaching number 4 on the UK Singles Chart. Lynn's soulful, gospel-infused voice led to collaborations with a wide array of artists, including Dr. John, the Rolling Stones (notably as a backing vocalist on 'Exile on Main St.'), Wilson Pickett, Sonny & Cher, and many others. Her only full-length album, 'Love Is Here and Now You're Gone,' was released in 1972, cementing her status as a cult favorite among soul aficionados.

Tami Lynn's legacy is deeply tied to the Northern Soul movement and the New Orleans R&B tradition. Her distinctive blend of gospel, soul, and R&B, along with her extensive session work, left an indelible mark on both sides of the Atlantic. She continued to perform and record sporadically until her death on June 26, 2020, in New Port Richey, Florida, remembered for her powerful voice and her role in some of the era's most iconic recordings.
