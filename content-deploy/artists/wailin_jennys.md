## Biography
The Wailin' Jennys are a Canadian folk trio that originated from a serendipitous meeting in 2002 at Sled Dog Music, a small guitar shop in Winnipeg, Manitoba. The group was formed when shop owner John Sharples brought together Ruth Moody, Nicky Mehta, and Cara Luft for a one-time performance. The show was so well-received that Sharples suggested they tour together and adopt the name "The Wailin' Jennys"—a clever pun on country singer Waylon Jennings' name. Initially, none of the members expected the project to last beyond a few performances, as they were all part-time musicians at the time. The group released their self-titled EP and debut album *40 Days* in 2004, which earned them a Juno Award in 2005 for Roots and Traditional Album of the Year and launched them onto the international folk scene, particularly through frequent appearances on Garrison Keillor's *A Prairie Home Companion*.

The trio's lineup solidified in 2007 when Heather Masse, a Maine-born singer and bassist, replaced founding member Cara Luft. This configuration of Ruth Moody (soprano), Nicky Mehta (mezzo), and Heather Masse (alto) has remained consistent and has become the definitive version of the band. Their subsequent albums—*Firecracker* (2006), *Live at Mauch Chunk Opera House* (2009), and *Bright Morning Stars* (2011)—demonstrated their artistic evolution, moving beyond traditional folk into alt-country, pop, and rock influences. *Bright Morning Stars*, recorded with acclaimed producer Mark Howard, won a second Juno Award in 2012 and reached number one on Billboard's bluegrass chart. The band has maintained their international presence for over two decades, performing at packed venues across Canada, the United States, and worldwide.

The Wailin' Jennys are celebrated for their exquisite vocal harmonies, impressive instrumental prowess, and witty stage presence. Their musical style blends Americana, traditional folk, bluegrass, and contemporary influences, creating what critics describe as a modern classic sound. Despite being geographically dispersed—with Moody based in Canada, Mehta in Winnipeg, and Masse in Taos, New Mexico—the trio has successfully maintained their creative partnership and longevity in the folk-roots music scene. Their discography includes multiple critically acclaimed albums, and they continue to be recognized as one of today's most beloved international folk acts.

## Fun Facts
- The band's name is a pun on country singer Waylon Jennings, who died the same month the group was formed in 2002. At a music conference where they were performing, attendees initially thought they were making fun of Jennings, causing some anger before the misunderstanding was cleared up.
- Although known as a Canadian-based band, only Nicky Mehta was born in Canada. Heather Masse is American (from Maine) and now lives in Taos, New Mexico, while Ruth Moody was born in Australia and moved to Canada at eight months old.
- The band was literally created by accident—they were brought together for a one-time-only performance at a tiny guitar shop in Winnipeg by the shop owner, John Sharples, who suggested they tour together and gave them their name. None of the members expected the project to last beyond a few shows.
- In 2009, the same year they released their landmark live album *Live at Mauch Chunk Opera House*, band member Nicky Mehta welcomed twin boys (Beck and Finn) with her partner Grant Johnson, while Heather Masse got married—demonstrating how the band balanced motherhood and marriage with their musical careers.
