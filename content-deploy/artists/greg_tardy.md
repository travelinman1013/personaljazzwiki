## Biography
Gregory Tardy was born on February 3, 1966, in New Orleans, Louisiana, to parents who were both opera singers, with his mother Jo Anne Tardy also recording as a jazz singer. This rich musical heritage set the foundation for his career, though his path to jazz was unconventional. Initially trained as a classical clarinetist at Carroll College and the University of Wisconsin, Tardy pursued what seemed destined to be a symphony career. However, in his early twenties, he discovered jazz saxophone and fundamentally redirected his artistic trajectory, never looking back. To support his education, he played tenor saxophone in funk and fusion bands while simultaneously pursuing formal jazz studies at the Wisconsin Conservatory of Music and later at the University of New Orleans.

Tardy emerged as a professional recording artist in 1992 when he released his debut album "Crazy Love," marking the beginning of a prolific career spanning multiple decades and record labels including Impulse!, SteepleChase Records, Palmetto Records, and Blue Note Records. As a versatile multi-reedist and composer, he has established himself as one of the most accomplished jazz musicians of his generation, known for his work in both straight-ahead jazz and Latin jazz contexts. His discography reflects consistent artistic growth, with over twenty solo albums and numerous collaborative projects showcasing his adaptability across various jazz idioms.

Beyond his recording career, Tardy has become an influential educator and bandleader. He currently serves as an associate professor of music in jazz saxophone at the University of Tennessee–Knoxville, where he teaches saxophone, clarinet, theory, and conducts master classes and clinics. Throughout his career, he has performed at major jazz festivals worldwide and collaborated with some of the most respected names in contemporary jazz, cementing his legacy as both a world-class performer and dedicated mentor to the next generation of jazz musicians.
