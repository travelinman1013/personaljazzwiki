## Biography
Lord Kitchener, born Aldwyn Roberts on 18 April 1922 in Arima, Trinidad and Tobago, was one of the towering figures of 20th‑century calypso and later soca music.[2][3] The son of a blacksmith, he learned to sing and play guitar from his father and began performing calypso as a boy, winning local competitions in Arima multiple times between 1938 and 1942 and singing in early calypso tents and with the Sheriff Band.[1][3][4] In 1943 he moved to Port of Spain, joined the Roving Brigade, and was discovered by impresario Johnny Khan, who brought him into the Victory Tent and introduced him to fellow calypsonian Growling Tiger; it was there that Roberts adopted the stage name Lord Kitchener, after the British general, in keeping with calypso’s tradition of grand sobriquets.[2] During World War II he became popular with American troops stationed in Trinidad, performed in New York, and in 1946 won his first official Road March title at Trinidad Carnival with “Jump In The Line.”[2][3]

In 1947–48 Kitchener toured Jamaica with Lord Beginner and Lord Woodbine before sailing on the Empire Windrush to England in 1948, symbolically linking his career to the first major wave of post‑war Caribbean migration.[2] On arrival at Tilbury Docks he performed “London Is the Place for Me” for a Pathé News report, and within two years he was a regular on BBC radio, a star of West Indian expatriate communities, and a leading voice in calypso’s brief worldwide craze of the 1950s, scoring hits such as “Kitch,” “Food from the West Indies,” “Tie Tongue Mopsy,” and “Alec Bedser Calypso.”[2][3] He also co‑wrote the celebrated “Victory Calypso” (“Cricket, Lovely Cricket”) chronicling the West Indies’ historic 1950 Test victory at Lord’s, opened a nightclub in Manchester, and held a successful London residency at The Sunset, all while remaining a dominant force back home.[2][3] After returning permanently to Trinidad in the early 1960s, Kitchener won the Carnival Road March title a record number of times in the 1960s and 1970s with songs like “Mama Dis Is Mas” and “My Pussin’,” operated his own Calypso Revue tent for three decades, and composed many of the definitive “pan calypsos” for steelband, including the pioneering “The Beat of the Steelband” (1944).[1][2][4][5]

Musically, Kitchener was known for elegantly crafted melodies, sophisticated harmonic sense, and witty, topical lyrics that ranged from party tunes to sharp social and political commentary, including criticism of British colonial rule.[2][3] He was a key innovator in uniting calypso with the developing steelband movement and later embraced and helped shape soca, recording major late‑career hits such as “Sugar Bum Bum,” one of the first big soca anthems of the late 1970s.[3][4] His songs became the backbone of Trinidad’s Panorama steelband competitions, and his Calypso Revue nurtured a new generation of stars including Calypso Rose, David Rudder, Black Stalin, and Denyse Plummer.[2][3][5] Often hailed as “the grand master of calypso” and “the greatest calypsonian of the post‑war age,” Kitchener performed into the 1990s, retired from the stage shortly before his death, and died in Port of Spain on 11 February 2000 at age 77, leaving a catalog that profoundly shaped calypso, soca, and Caribbean popular music.[1][2][3]

## Fun Facts
- Kitchener chose his stage name after British military figure Lord Kitchener, mirroring calypso’s tradition of grand, often aristocratic titles adopted for theatrical flair.[1][2]
- On arriving in Britain aboard the Empire Windrush in 1948, he stepped off the ship at Tilbury Docks and immediately performed his composition “London Is the Place for Me” for a Pathé News film crew, creating one of the most iconic early audio‑visual documents of the Windrush generation.[2]
- He composed what is widely regarded as the first calypso written specifically for steelband, “The Beat of the Steelband” (1944), helping to launch the enduring partnership between calypso composers and steel orchestras.[1][4]
- Despite dominating calypso for decades and winning numerous Road March titles, he was crowned Calypso King only once— in 1975, with the song “Tribute to Spree Simon”—and then voluntarily stopped competing the very next year.[2][3]

- [[steelbands_and_the_trinidad_steelband_movement|Steelbands and the Trinidad steelband movement]] - Kitchener composed the first widely noted pan calypso and remained closely allied with steelbands, writing many of the most performed Panorama selections, effectively collaborating with leading bands through his compositions.[1][2][4] (“The Beat of the Steelband” (1944) and numerous later Panorama favorites such as “Mama Dis Is Mas,” “Rainorama,” and others routinely arranged for steel orchestras.[1][2][4]) [1940s–1990s]
