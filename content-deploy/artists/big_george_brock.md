## Biography
Big George Brock was born on May 16, 1932, in Grenada, Mississippi, into a family of sharecroppers on a plantation in the Mississippi Delta. He began playing harmonica around age eight, inspired initially by country singer-harmonica player Wayne Raney heard on the radio, and later by listening to John Lee "Sonny Boy" Williamson's 78 r.p.m. records on his mother's Victrola. By the late 1940s, Brock was performing at house parties and fish fries around the Clarksdale area, where he fell under the spell of his major influence, Howlin' Wolf, who performed locally each week in the town of Walls. During this period, Brock also developed a passion for boxing, fighting on a local level with considerable success, reportedly even knocking out future world heavyweight champion Sonny Liston in a sparring match in St. Louis—an experience that later influenced his participation in numerous "Battle of the Blues" contests with other local musicians.

After moving to St. Louis by the early 1950s, Brock began sitting in at clubs around town before forming his band Big George and the Houserockers, which worked in clubs and taverns throughout the city. By the late 1950s, he had opened his own establishment, the Club Caravan, where he performed regularly with his Houserockers and hosted numerous national acts including Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, Jimmy Reed, Albert King, Gatemouth Brown, and Ike and Tina Turner. He maintained a long association with St. Louis guitarist Riley Coatie Sr., collaborating on stage and in the studio for decades. Despite performing for several decades, Brock did not make his first recordings until 1990 with the release of the LP Should Have Been There. His career gained significant momentum after 2004 when he began working with blues entrepreneur Roger Stolle, leading to his label debut Club Caravan on Cat Head Presents in 2005, which garnered international acclaim and led to European tours.

Big George Brock remained committed to the 1950s postwar blues style throughout his seven-decade career, maintaining an unadulterated approach to the music he learned directly from his mentors. He passed away peacefully at his home in St. Louis on April 10, 2020, after a lengthy illness, leaving behind a legacy as a dedicated custodian of authentic Delta and St. Louis blues traditions. Though he did not achieve wider recognition until late in life, Brock's absolute dedication to the blues and his role as a cultural ambassador of the genre secured his place in blues history.
