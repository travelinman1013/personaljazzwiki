## Biography
Tara Lily is a British-Bengali musician from Peckham, South London, whose upbringing in a multicultural environment profoundly shaped her musical identity. Immersed in a diverse array of genres from an early age—including jazz, R&B, electronica, and traditional Bengali folk—she honed her craft at the Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music, studying jazz piano and voice, and also delved into Indian classical music[2][5]. Her debut album, 'Speak In The Dark,' released in 2024, is a deeply personal exploration of emotional highs and lows, influenced by her experiences with ADHD and her journeys through Asia, blending jazz, electronica, trip-hop, and South Asian soundscapes[2].

Lily's career has been marked by a series of acclaimed EPs, including 'Last Flight Out' and 'Lost in London,' and she became the first British artist signed to Motown Records UK[6][2]. Her collaborations span a wide range of artists, notably working with King Krule on the 2025 EP 'Quiet Nights (Early Takes)' and the single 'Tropical Storm,' which showcases a moody, cinematic style that merges both artists' jazz-inspired sensibilities[1][3]. Lily's live performances are celebrated for their atmospheric intimacy, and she has supported major acts like RAYE and Dhruv, while also making appearances at festivals such as Glastonbury and We Out Here[2].

Her legacy is defined by her fearless genre-blending and her ability to channel personal and cultural narratives into her music. Tara Lily stands out as a formidable talent in the UK R&B and jazz scenes, with her work resonating for its emotional depth, innovative production, and celebration of her British-Bengali heritage[2][6].
