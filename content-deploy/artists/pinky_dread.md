## Biography
Pinky Dread, born George Henry in Falmouth, Jamaica, is a reggae and reggae‑pop vocalist best known for his distinctive catalogue of reggae covers of classic soul, pop and rock songs.[3][4][1] He is the son of celebrated Jamaican singer Hortense Ellis, often referred to as “Jamaica’s First Lady of Songs,” which placed him in a deeply musical environment from an early age and connected him directly to the roots of classic Jamaican vocal traditions.[4] Growing up in this context, Henry absorbed both vintage rocksteady and reggae as well as the international soul and pop repertoire his mother interpreted, which later became central to his own artistic identity as Pinky Dread.

Over time, Pinky Dread developed a career that bridges traditional reggae with Latin and reggaeton‑flavored rhythms, crafting a sound that is both rooted in Jamaica and stylistically cosmopolitan.[1] Much of his output consists of inventive reggae reinterpretations of well‑known songs such as “A Change Is Gonna Come,” “Stop Crying Your Heart Out,” “Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word,” “Ironic,” “Isn’t She Lovely,” “Say My Name,” and “The Great Pretender,” highlighting his smooth vocal delivery and his knack for reshaping familiar melodies in a laid‑back, Caribbean groove.[1] He has also released original material, including the 2023 album “From a Reggae Point of View,” which showcases his blend of reggae and Latin influences on tracks like “Smooth Sailing,” “Rasta Love,” and “Good Vibes.”[1] Active on the international reggae circuit and streaming platforms, Pinky Dread has built a reputation as a versatile interpreter who keeps reggae connected to a wide global songbook while honoring the legacy of Jamaican vocal music he inherited from his family.[1][3]

In interviews, Pinky Dread has positioned himself as a defender of roots reggae, commenting on its challenges and under‑recognition in contemporary Jamaica even as it remains popular abroad, which underscores his commitment to the genre’s cultural significance.[5] His work with various collaborative projects and studio collectives places him within a network of modern reggae and reggae‑fusion artists who update classic sounds for new audiences, reinforcing his role as a bridge between old‑school roots sensibilities and current global pop trends.[1][6]
