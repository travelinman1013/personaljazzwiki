## Biography
Gerald Wilson (1918–2014) was a pioneering American jazz trumpeter, composer, arranger, bandleader, and educator, renowned for his innovative work in big band jazz. Born in Shelby, Mississippi, and raised in Detroit, Wilson began his musical journey studying piano with his mother before focusing on trumpet and formal music education at Cass Technical High School. His professional career launched in 1939 when he joined the Jimmie Lunceford Orchestra as a trumpeter and arranger, quickly making an impact with original compositions like 'Hi Spook' and 'Yard Dog Mazurka.'

After serving in the U.S. Navy during World War II, Wilson settled in Los Angeles, where he formed the Gerald Wilson Orchestra in 1944. His ensembles, known for their sophisticated harmonies and blues-infused sound, featured leading musicians such as Melba Liston and Snooky Young. Wilson became a sought-after arranger, contributing to the works of Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Dizzy Gillespie, Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughan, and Ray Charles. His compositions often drew on diverse influences, including Mexican culture and classical forms, as heard in celebrated works like 'Theme for Monterey' and 'Detroit Suite.'

Wilson's career spanned more than seven decades, during which he recorded extensively, taught at UCLA, and influenced generations of jazz musicians. His legacy is marked by his distinctive harmonic language, innovative arrangements, and a commitment to education, earning him honors such as the NEA Jazz Master award and recognition as one of the most important figures in modern big band jazz.
