## Biography
Neyde Fraga (often credited as Neide Fraga, born Neide Hor-Meyll Fraga) was a Brazilian singer from São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil, born on 17 December 1924 and active primarily from the 1940s onward.[2][4] She began her career in 1942, entering Brazilian show business at a time when radio was the dominant medium for popular music, and she gradually established herself as a seasoned vocalist within the burgeoning urban music scene.[2][4] Although later rediscovered by collectors and jazz enthusiasts, during her active years she worked largely within the orbit of Brazilian popular song, interpreted with a refined, jazzy sensibility that made her an enduring name among specialists.[2][5]

Fraga’s repertoire, as evidenced by compilations and reissues that feature her work, places her at the intersection of Brazilian popular music and early forms of Brazilian jazz, with interpretations that sit comfortably alongside bossa-influenced and nightclub-oriented arrangements.[5][6] Contemporary DJs and reissue labels have highlighted tracks like “Onda Quebrando” as examples of her sophisticated phrasing and rhythmic ease with samba-jazz and related styles, which has led to a modest revival of interest among collectors of Brazilian jazz and 1960s–70s Brazilian vocal music.[5][6][7] While she did not become a mainstream international star, her work has gained posthumous recognition in niche circles, contributing to the broader appreciation of mid‑20th‑century Brazilian vocalists. She died in Rio de Janeiro on 14 December 1987.[2][4]
