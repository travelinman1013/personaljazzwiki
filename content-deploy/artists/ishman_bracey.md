## Biography
Ishmon Bracey (sometimes credited as Ishman Bracey) was born in Byram, Mississippi, likely in 1899 or 1901, and became one of the earliest and most influential Delta blues musicians in the Jackson area. He learned guitar from local musicians such as Rubin Lacey and Louis Cooper, developing a distinctive bottleneck style. Bracey began his career performing at dances, juke joints, and rural gatherings before moving to Jackson in the late 1910s, where he became a prominent figure in the vibrant local blues scene[1][2][3].

Bracey's recording career began in 1928 when talent scout H. C. Speir arranged for him to record for Victor Records in Memphis, accompanied by Papa Charlie McCoy. He later recorded for Paramount Records with the New Orleans Nehi Boys, featuring Kid Ernest Michall on clarinet and Charles Taylor on piano—an unusual combination for Mississippi blues at the time. Bracey's vocal style was notable for its nasal tone and unembellished delivery, and his compositions, such as "Trouble Hearted Blues" and "Left Alone Blues," are regarded as classics of the genre. His total recorded output was limited to just 16 songs, making his original 78-rpm records highly prized among collectors[1][2][3].

After the mid-1930s, as the Jackson blues scene dispersed, Bracey's musical activity waned, and he eventually became an ordained Baptist minister in the early 1950s, leaving blues music behind. Though he refused to perform blues in his later years, he provided valuable information to researchers about the early Mississippi blues scene and contributed to the rediscovery of other blues artists, such as Skip James. Bracey died in Jackson, Mississippi, on February 12, 1970[2][3].

## Fun Facts
- Bracey was one of the few Mississippi bluesmen to sing with a nasal tone, avoiding the embellishments common in the genre[1].
- He was listed as a musician in a 'hotel orchestra' in the 1930 census, indicating his musical versatility beyond blues[2].
- After World War II, Bracey became a Baptist minister and refused to play or even discuss blues music, focusing solely on sacred material[2][3].
- Original copies of Bracey's 78-rpm records are among the most sought-after items by blues collectors due to their rarity and historical significance[1][3].
