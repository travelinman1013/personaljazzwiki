## Biography
James Edward "Snooky" Pryor (September 15, 1919 or 1921 – October 18, 2006) was a pioneering American Chicago blues harmonica player, widely credited with helping to shape the postwar blues sound. Born in Lambert, Mississippi, Pryor overcame his preacher father's objections to the 'devil's music' and began playing harmonica at age 14, drawing inspiration from Sonny Boy Williamson I and II. By the mid-1930s, he was performing in informal gatherings with future blues legends like Jimmy Rogers before moving to Chicago around 1940.[4][5]

While serving in the U.S. Army, Pryor experimented with amplifying his bugle calls through a PA system, which later inspired his innovative approach to amplified harmonica. After his discharge in 1945, he became a fixture on Chicago's Maxwell Street Market, recording some of the earliest postwar Chicago blues classics such as "Telephone Blues" and "Snooky & Moody's Boogie" in 1948. His energetic, swinging harp style made him a sought-after session musician, collaborating with artists like Floyd Jones, Moody Jones, Homesick James, and Sunnyland Slim. Despite his influence, Pryor's recordings did not achieve mainstream chart success, and he left the music scene in the late 1960s to work as a carpenter in southern Illinois.[1][2][4]

A revival of interest in traditional blues during the 1970s led to Pryor's musical comeback, and he continued to record and perform for a new generation of fans until his death in 2006. Pryor's legacy lies in his spirited, unadulterated blues style and his role as a bridge between Delta blues traditions and the electrified Chicago sound, influencing countless harmonica players and blues musicians worldwide.[4][5]

## Fun Facts
- Pryor is credited with pioneering the technique of playing amplified harmonica by cupping a microphone in his hands, though some historians attribute this innovation to Little Walter.[1][5]
- His father was a preacher who forbade blues music at home, but Pryor secretly learned harmonica and could quote the Bible at length.[4]
- After leaving music in the late 1960s, Pryor worked as a carpenter in southern Illinois until blues fans tracked him down and revived his career in the 1970s.[4][5]
- Pryor's nickname 'Snooky' was originally given to his childhood friend Jimmy Rogers; bluesman Floyd Jones later dubbed Pryor as Snooky in Chicago.[4]
