## Biography
Flora Purim (born March 6, 1942) is a Brazilian jazz vocalist from Rio de Janeiro whose six-octave voice and fearless experimentation helped define 1970s jazz fusion and Brazilian jazz internationally.[2][6] She grew up in a musical household: her Romanian father was an amateur violinist, her Brazilian Jewish mother a classical pianist and avid jazz record collector, exposing her to artists such as Oscar Peterson and Erroll Garner and fueling her early interest in the jazz vanguard.[2][3] As a young woman she studied guitar, piano, and multiple languages, and briefly pursued competitive swimming and diving at Rio’s Fluminense club before committing fully to singing.[2] In the early 1960s she became an established bossa nova singer in Brazil, recording singles and albums, appearing on her own television series, and performing with everything from big dance bands to nightclub trios while gradually incorporating more radical, politically charged material in defiance of Brazil’s military dictatorship.[1][3]

In 1967 she married drummer and percussionist Airto Moreira and moved with him to New York in 1968, where the couple quickly became sought-after in the resurgent U.S. jazz–Brazil dialogue.[1][2][3] Purim worked with Stan Getz and Duke Pearson, toured Europe with Getz and Gil Evans, and soon joined Chick Corea’s groundbreaking fusion group Return to Forever, where her soaring wordless vocals and rhythmic agility became central to the band’s sound.[1][2] In parallel she studied music reading and composition with Brazilian master Moacir Santos in Los Angeles, sharpening her technical foundation.[1][4] Signing to Milestone Records, she released her U.S. debut "Butterfly Dreams" in 1973, followed by "Stories to Tell," earning top female jazz vocalist honors in Record World and Cash Box and, later, four DownBeat Best Female Jazz Vocalist awards plus two Grammy nominations for Best Female Jazz Performance.[1][3][6] Through the 1970s–1990s she recorded and toured with Carlos Santana, Dizzy Gillespie’s United Nations Orchestra, and Grateful Dead drummer Mickey Hart (including the Grammy-winning "Planet Drum"), while maintaining a solo career that fused jazz, Brazilian rhythms, funk, psychedelia, and socially conscious lyrics.[1][5] Honored in 2002 with Brazil’s Order of Rio Branco alongside Moreira for promoting Brazilian culture abroad, Purim is widely regarded as one of jazz fusion’s defining voices and a key bridge between Brazilian music and the global jazz world.[1]

Artistically, Purim is known for blending the subtle phrasing and intimacy of bossa nova with the extended range, vocal effects, and rhythmic daring of modern jazz and fusion, often using wordless vocals as an improvising instrument equal to horns or keyboards.[1][2] Her work with Return to Forever helped crystallize a new, electrified, globally influenced jazz aesthetic, and her subsequent solo albums expanded that language with layered percussion, electric keyboards, and intricate vocal lines.[2][3][5] Throughout her career she has emphasized themes of freedom and resistance, using her lyrics and repertoire to comment on political repression in Brazil and to celebrate Afro-Brazilian and pan-Latin identities.[1] Her legacy can be heard in later generations of Brazilian and international vocalists who treat the voice as a flexible, improvising instrument and who move fluidly between jazz, Brazilian music, and broader fusion styles.
