## Biography
King Solomon Hill, born Joe Holmes on July 18, 1897 near McComb, Mississippi, was an enigmatic figure in early country blues. A self-taught guitarist and singer, Holmes spent much of his life traveling through Louisiana and Mississippi, performing at parties, picnics, and juke joints. His stage name was derived from the King Solomon Hill Baptist Church in the Yellow Pine community of Louisiana, where he resided for a time. Holmes's musical career reached its peak in 1932 when he recorded six sides (four songs with alternate takes) for Paramount Records in Grafton, Wisconsin, including the haunting 'Gone Dead Train' and 'Whoopee Blues.' These recordings, characterized by his eerie bottleneck guitar technique and chilling falsetto, are considered masterpieces of the genre, though only a few copies were ever pressed due to Paramount's impending bankruptcy.[1][2][3]

Holmes's style was a unique fusion of influences from his friends Sam Collins and Ramblin' Thomas, as well as elements from Blind Lemon Jefferson. His music stood out for its emotional intensity and originality, blending the regional sounds of south Mississippi and east Texas/Louisiana. Despite his brief recording career, Hill's work has been lauded for its primitive force and haunting atmosphere, making him a significant, if mysterious, figure in blues history. After his recording session, Holmes returned to performing locally, but little else is known about his later life. He reportedly struggled with heavy drinking and died of a brain hemorrhage in Sibley, Louisiana, on August 13, 1940.[1][2][3][5][7]

King Solomon Hill's legacy endures through his small but influential discography, which has inspired generations of blues musicians and enthusiasts. His recordings remain rare and highly prized, and his identity was the subject of much debate among blues scholars until confirmed by Gayle Dean Wardlow through interviews with Holmes's acquaintances. Today, Hill is remembered as one of the most original voices of early country blues, his music a testament to the rich, complex history of the American South.[2][3][7]
