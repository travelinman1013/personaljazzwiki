## Biography
Fana Subira Hughes, known professionally as Fana Hues, was born on June 15, 1995, in Pasadena, California, into a large musical family of nine children. Her parents were deeply artistic—her mother was a dancer while her father was a multi-instrumentalist proficient in piano, guitar, and bass who directly taught Fana and her siblings music. Growing up in this creatively rich environment, Fana was immersed in music from an early age, though her childhood presented significant challenges. Between ages five and ten, she was unable to sing due to a severe combination of scarlet fever, tonsillitis, and strep throat that left her voice compromised. This period of vocal silence became formative rather than limiting; through years of dedicated practice and family support, she eventually regained her voice and developed the distinctive, emotionally resonant vocal style that would define her artistry.

Fana Hues began her professional career performing in her family's band before transitioning to a solo career. In 2020, she released her debut single "Notice Me" followed by her debut album Hues, establishing herself as an independent R&B artist with a sophisticated, introspective sound. Her breakthrough came in 2021 when she was featured on Tyler, the Creator's song "Sweet / I Thought You Wanted to Dance" from his album Call Me If You Get Lost, significantly expanding her audience. She released her second studio album Flora + Fana in March 2022, which explored themes of heartbreak, self-discovery, and personal resilience through psychedelic and soulful production. Her third album Moth arrived on June 14, 2024, featuring 13 tracks including a collaboration with Bam Marley and singles like "Paper Tigers" and "Rental," further demonstrating her artistic evolution and willingness to push creative boundaries.

Fana Hues' musical style represents a contemporary evolution of classic R&B, characterized by sleek, modern production infused with vintage influences and deeply personal, introspective songwriting. Her work explores complex emotional landscapes—love, loss, self-awareness, grief, and resilience—with an authenticity that resonates across her discography. Drawing inspiration from legendary vocalists like Nina Simone, Anita Baker, Dionne Warwick, Beyoncé Knowles, and Mary J. Blige, she has crafted a distinctive artistic voice that honors R&B traditions while embracing experimental production elements. Through touring with artists including Raveena, Snoh Alegra, Lucky Daye, and Giveon, Fana has established herself as a significant voice in contemporary alternative R&B, known for her emotional depth, vocal prowess, and willingness to explore vulnerability in her music.
