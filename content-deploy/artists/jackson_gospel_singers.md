## Biography
The Jackson Southernaires are a renowned gospel group originating from Jackson, Mississippi, formed in 1940 by Frank Crisler. The group began by performing locally, quickly gaining recognition for their musical talent and dedication to gospel music. Their innovative use of bass, drums, keyboard, and guitar set them apart as the first gospel group in Mississippi to incorporate these instruments, helping to modernize the genre and expand its appeal.[1]

Over the decades, the Jackson Southernaires developed a distinct style rooted in traditional gospel, blending soulful harmonies with contemporary instrumentation. They signed their first recording contract with Duke/Peacock Records in 1963, followed by deals with ABC/Dunhill and Malaco Records, where each album achieved national acclaim. Their radio show ran for forty-three years, and they hosted their own television program, 'Gospel Unlimited,' further cementing their influence. The group received numerous accolades, including Stellar Award nominations in 1985 and 1986, a win in 1989, and a Grammy nomination for 'Gospel Unlimited' in 1991.[1]

The Jackson Southernaires' legacy is marked by their commitment to faith and musical excellence. With members like Huey Williams, Roger Bryant Jr., Maurice Surrell, James Burks, and Luther Jennings (the last original member), the group has inspired generations of gospel musicians and fans. Their belief that 'without God they cannot make it, but with God on their side they will be a success' underscores their enduring message and impact on American gospel music.[1]
