## Biography
Sault is a British music collective that emerged in 2019, quickly gaining attention for their genre-blending sound and enigmatic public presence. The group, based in London, England, is known for its anonymity—members have never revealed their identities, given interviews, or performed live shows until late 2023, and their album artwork is deliberately minimal, often featuring only numbers or abstract images[2][8]. Their music draws from soul, funk, post-punk, house, disco, and even trip-hop, with lyrics frequently addressing Black-centric issues and social justice themes, such as systemic oppression and resilience in the face of adversity[3][5][8]. Sault’s debut album, *5*, was released in May 2019, followed by a rapid succession of critically acclaimed albums, including *7*, *Untitled (Black Is)*, *Untitled (Rise)*, *Nine*, and the orchestral instrumental *Air*[8]. Their work has been praised for its emotional depth, innovative production, and refusal to be easily categorized, earning them a devoted following and significant critical acclaim, including a Mercury Prize nomination for *Untitled (Rise)* in 2021[5][8]. Despite their underground ethos, Sault’s influence has grown steadily, with their music resonating both within the UK and internationally.
