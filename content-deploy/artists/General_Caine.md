## Biography
General Caine, later known as General Kane, was an American music group fronted by Mitch McDowell. Born Mitchell Leon McDowell on June 29, 1954, in San Bernardino, California, McDowell formed the group after leaving military school. Initially, he was part of the group Booty People, which released one album for MCA Records. General Caine signed with Groove Time Records in 1978 and released two albums: *Let Me In* (1978) and *Get Down Attack* (1980). The group later moved to Tabu Records, releasing *Girls* (1982), featuring the hit song 'For Lovers Only', and *Dangerous* (1983). In the mid-1980s, the group changed its name to General Kane and signed with Motown Records, releasing *In Full Chill* (1986) and *Wide Open* (1987). Mitch McDowell pursued a career in law enforcement after leaving music and was tragically murdered in January 1992. General Caine's music style was deeply rooted in funk, with influences from soul and R&B. Their legacy includes carrying the P-Funk vibe, especially in their album *Girls*, which featured collaborations with P-Funk members like Dawn, Fred, Maceo, Ray, and Kevin Goins. The group's music often reflected contemporary themes, such as drug addiction in 'Crack Killed Applejack'. Despite their contributions to the funk genre, General Caine's later work was marked by a shift towards more mellow sounds without losing their rap influences.
