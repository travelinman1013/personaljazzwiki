## Biography
Jimmy Charles 'Duck' Holmes, born July 28, 1947, in Bentonia, Mississippi, grew up immersed in the blues tradition as his parents owned and operated the Blue Front Café, the oldest continuously running juke joint in Mississippi, established in 1948 when he was just one year old. His father was a farmer, and the family home housed up to 16 people, with the café serving as the community's ballroom and cultural hub featuring a concrete dance floor. At age ten in 1957, Holmes first picked up a guitar belonging to Henry Stuckey, who lived at the café and played on the back porch, planting the early seeds of his musical interest, though he did not play seriously until the early 1970s.[1][2][5][8]

Holmes took over the Blue Front Café from his parents in 1970 and became the last direct disciple of the Bentonia blues tradition, learning primarily from masters like Henry Stuckey and Jack Owens through observation—watching their hands and imitating their open E-minor tuning style characterized by haunting, eerie, dark acoustic sounds influenced by Skip James. He developed his craft amid gatherings of local bluesmen including Bud, Cornelius Bright, Tommy West, and Cleo Pullum at the café, blending Bentonia's rural style with elements of hill country blues. As the pre-eminent custodian of Bentonia blues, Holmes has recorded albums like *It Is What It Is* (2016) at the café itself and hosts annual events such as the Bentonia Blues Festival to preserve the tradition.[1][3][4][7]

Now in his late 70s, Holmes remains a living legend, performing worldwide while steadfastly running the Blue Front Café daily out of passion rather than financial need, having returned to Bentonia after brief tours elsewhere. His legacy endures as the greatest living proponent of Bentonia blues, a highly localized style known for its repetitive, primitive folk elements, ensuring its survival through mentorship, performances, and the unyielding spirit of the juke joint birthplace.[1][3][4][5][6]
