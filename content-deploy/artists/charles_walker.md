## Biography
Charles 'Wigg' Walker, born July 12, 1940, in Nashville, Tennessee, is a celebrated American soul and blues singer whose career spans more than six decades. Nicknamed 'Wigg' by his mother for his full head of hair at birth, Walker began performing as a child, singing and tap dancing before moving into the vibrant R&B scene of the 1960s. He rose to prominence as the frontman for the J.C. Davis Band, touring nationally and sharing stages with legendary artists such as James Brown, Jackie Wilson, Etta James, Wilson Pickett, Little Willie John, Otis Redding, and Sam Cooke. His early recordings with the band, notably 'Sweet Sweet Love' and 'The Chicken Scratch' for Chess Records, have become prized collector's items.

In 1964, Walker founded Little Charles and the Sidewinders, a group that became a fixture in the New York nightclub circuit and recorded for both Chess and Decca Records. Despite limited commercial chart success, Walker's energetic performances and soulful voice earned him a dedicated following. During the 1970s, he briefly stepped away from music to run an art gallery in New York but returned as a songwriter for Motown and later relocated to Europe, where renewed interest in his earlier work led to successful tours, especially in England and Spain. The blues and R&B revival of the 1990s brought Walker back to Nashville, where he fronted The Dynamites and continued to record and perform, cementing his legacy as a dynamic and enduring figure in American soul and blues music.
