## Biography
John Cale, born March 9, 1942 in Garnant, Wales, is a classically trained musician whose career has spanned more than five decades and traversed genres from classical and avant-garde to rock, proto-punk, and electronica[1][2][3]. After studying music at Goldsmiths College in London and joining the Welsh Youth Orchestra, Cale won a scholarship to the Tanglewood music academy in Massachusetts, where he impressed composer Aaron Copland[5]. Drawn to the experimental scene in New York, he collaborated with avant-garde composers John Cage and La Monte Young, participating in groundbreaking performances such as Erik Satie’s 'Vexations'[1][5][6].

Cale co-founded The Velvet Underground in 1964 alongside Lou Reed, bringing his classical discipline and experimental sensibilities to the band’s influential early albums, which became touchstones of art rock and proto-punk[1][2][3]. After leaving the group in 1968, Cale embarked on a prolific solo career, releasing albums that alternated between pop, hard rock, and classical-influenced works, such as 'Vintage Violence,' 'Paris 1919,' and 'Music for a New Society'[1][4]. He also became a sought-after producer, shaping the sound of artists like Nico, The Stooges, Patti Smith, and the Modern Lovers[2][7].

Cale’s legacy is marked by his restless creativity and willingness to blur boundaries between genres. His influence can be traced through generations of underground and alternative musicians, and his work as both a collaborator and producer has helped define the sound of modern rock and experimental music[1][2][3].
