## Biography
Drivin' N Cryin' is an American southern rock band formed in Atlanta, Georgia, in 1985 by singer-songwriter Kevn Kinney, bassist Tim Nielsen, and drummer Paul Lenz. Kinney, originally from Milwaukee, moved to Atlanta in the early 1980s, where he worked by day and played folk music by night. The band's name reflects the blend of Kinney's folk ('cryin'') and Nielsen and Lenz's punk and rock influences ('drivin''). Their debut album, 'Scarred But Smarter,' released in 1986 on 688 Records, quickly established them as a staple of the southeastern club scene and drew critical praise for its fusion of folk lyricism and hard-driving rock energy.

After signing with Island Records, Drivin' N Cryin' released a string of albums that expanded their sound and audience, notably 'Whisper Tames the Lion' (1988), 'Mystery Road' (1989), and their commercial breakthrough 'Fly Me Courageous' (1991), which achieved gold status. The band's style is characterized by a dynamic mix of southern rock, alt-country, folk, and hard rock, with Kinney's storytelling at the core. Over the years, the lineup shifted, with notable additions like guitarist Buren Fowler and keyboardist Joey Huffman, but Kinney and Nielsen remained the creative nucleus. The band's resilience and adaptability have allowed them to endure changing musical landscapes, and they continue to tour and record, celebrated for their energetic live performances and enduring regional influence.

Drivin' N Cryin's legacy is cemented in the southern rock canon, particularly in the Atlanta music scene, where they were inducted into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame in 2015. Their influence extends to a generation of alternative and southern rock musicians, and their songs, especially 'Straight to Hell' and 'Honeysuckle Blue,' remain staples of the genre. The band's ability to navigate both mainstream and underground success speaks to their authenticity and the lasting appeal of their music.
