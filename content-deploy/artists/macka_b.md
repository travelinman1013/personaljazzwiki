## Biography
Macka B, born Christopher MacFarlane in 1966 in Wolverhampton, West Midlands, England, to Jamaican parents, is a British-born reggae artist, activist and one of the United Kingdom’s most influential dancehall DJs.[1][3][7] As a child he played violin and sang in the school choir, but at home he gravitated to the roots reggae of Burning Spear, Bob Marley, Peter Tosh and Count Ossie, which shaped both his sound and his Rastafarian consciousness.[1][2] After leaving school he trained as an engineering apprentice at the Ever Ready factory, but redundancy from that job pushed him to focus seriously on deejaying (toasting), practicing at home while studying the work of pioneering Jamaican DJs such as U‑Roy, I‑Roy, Big Youth and Prince Far I.[1][2] In 1982 a formative trip to Jamaica deepened his commitment to the music; the following year he won a DJ competition at the Rising Star club in Bilston, leading to radio appearances, TV slots, and local success with the band Pre‑Wax and their single “Maggie’s Letter.”[1][2]

A televised performance brought him to the attention of producer Mad Professor, who signed him to the Ariwa label and produced his landmark debut album “Sign of the Times” (1986), a chart‑topping British reggae set that fused dub‑wise production with hard‑hitting social and spiritual lyrics.[1][2] Through a prolific run of albums for Ariwa and other labels—including “We’ve Had Enough,” “Looks Are Deceiving,” “Buppie Culture,” “Natural Suntan,” “Peace Cup,” “Roots Ragga,” “Jamaica No Problem,” “Here Comes Trouble,” “Hold On to Your Culture,” “Suspicious,” “Roots & Culture,” “Global Messenger,” “Word, Sound and Power,” “By Royale Command,” and later works such as “Change the World,” “Rasta Soldier,” and “Never Played a 45”—he helped pull dancehall back toward Rastafarian, political and cultural themes while still embracing updated, dancehall‑age production techniques.[1][2] His rough, gravelly voice, nimble rhymes and mixture of serious commentary with occasional humor made him distinctive, and he consistently avoided overt commercial crossover in favor of roots‑oriented integrity.[1][3]

Over a career spanning more than three decades in the UK, Jamaica and worldwide, Macka B has become known not only as a recording artist but as a tireless live performer, touring extensively across Europe, Africa, Australia and beyond, and becoming one of the first foreign and first British reggae artists to reach territories such as Poland, Australia and the former Yugoslavia.[2][6] A practicing Rastaman, his work centers on spiritual uplift, black consciousness, pan‑African themes and social justice, while in later years he has also become a vocal advocate for veganism and holistic well‑being, further extending his influence beyond reggae audiences.[3][7] His legacy rests on bridging roots reggae, dub and dancehall; carrying forward the tradition of the conscious DJ in Britain; and helping to globalize UK reggae through consistent touring, collaboration and message‑driven music.[1][2][4][8]
