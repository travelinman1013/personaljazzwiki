## Biography
Sia Kate Isobelle Furler was born on December 18, 1975, in Adelaide, South Australia, where she developed an early passion for music inspired by artists including Aretha Franklin, Stevie Wonder, and Sting. She began her professional career in the mid-1990s as a singer in the local acid jazz band Crisp, and in 1997, following the band's disbandment, she released her debut solo album OnlySee. Seeking greater opportunities, she relocated to London in her early twenties, where she initially performed as a background vocalist for Jamiroquai before joining the British electronica duo Zero 7, with whom she provided lead vocals on their first three studio albums and toured extensively from the late 1990s through the early 2000s.

After signing with Sony Music's Dance Pool label in 2000, Sia released her second album Healing Is Difficult in 2001, which blended retro jazz and soul influences and marked a significant step in her solo career, though she remained dissatisfied with its promotion. She subsequently signed with Go! Beat Records and released Colour the Small One in 2004, but frustrated by poor marketing and limited mainstream success, she relocated to New York City in 2005 to pursue touring across the United States. A turning point came when her song "Breathe Me" was featured in the final scene of the HBO series Six Feet Under, significantly raising her profile in America. During a hiatus from performing in the early 2010s, Sia focused on songwriting for other artists, creating major hits including "Titanium" with David Guetta, "Diamonds" with Rihanna, and "Wild Ones" with Flo Rida. Her breakthrough as a solo artist arrived in 2014 with the album 1000 Forms of Fear, which debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 and spawned the top-ten single "Chandelier," accompanied by iconic music videos featuring child dancer Maddie Ziegler. In 2016, she achieved her first Hot 100 number-one single with "Cheap Thrills" from her album This Is Acting, establishing herself as a major pop force while famously choosing to perform with her face obscured by wigs, maintaining anonymity despite her commercial success.

## Fun Facts
- A week before Sia was scheduled to move to England to be with her boyfriend in the late 1990s, he was tragically hit by a car and killed—an event she has described as devastating and which profoundly influenced her songwriting, particularly on the album Healing Is Difficult.
- Sia won the APRA Breakthrough Songwriter award in 2002, recognizing her songwriting talents during a period when her solo career was still developing.
- Despite achieving massive commercial success with hits like 'Chandelier' and 'Cheap Thrills,' Sia deliberately obscures her face during performances by wearing wigs, choosing to maintain anonymity and privacy despite being in the spotlight.
- Her song 'Breathe Me' gained significant exposure when it was featured in the final scene of the HBO series Six Feet Under, which proved to be a crucial turning point in building her American fanbase.
