## Biography
Bill Wrick was an American musician born in 1939 who became known for his work in the country-funk genre during the early 1970s. Operating primarily out of the Deep South, Wrick carved out a niche in the obscure but vibrant country-funk scene that emerged when soul, funk, and country musical traditions intersected. His recording career, though brief and largely overlooked by mainstream audiences, produced memorable work that has since been recognized by music historians and collectors as part of an important but underappreciated chapter in American regional music.
