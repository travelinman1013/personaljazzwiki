## Biography
Sola Akingbola is a UK-based percussionist, composer, and singer-songwriter born on August 2, 1965, in Lagos, Nigeria, to Yoruba parents.[1] Raised in London, he developed his musical foundation through the city's 1980s underground rare groove scene, where he worked as a dancer and DJ before formally developing his drumming skills under Nigerian percussionist Gasper Lawal.[1] His early musical education was deeply rooted in Yoruba culture, inspired by his parents' favorite artists including King Sunny Ade, Ebenezer Obey, and Haruna Isola, as well as international influences ranging from Afro-Beat pioneer Fela Kuti to soul and funk legends like Earth, Wind and Fire and Funkadelic.[1][2]

Akingbola rose to prominence on the UK jazz circuit in the early 1990s, first performing with late jazz guitarist Ronny Jordan, with whom he recorded two albums—'A Quiet Storm' and 'Light to Dark'—and contributed compositions.[1] In 1995, drummer Derrick McKenzie recruited him as percussionist for Jamiroquai, the Grammy Award-winning acid-jazz funk band, where he has remained a core member for over three decades.[1][3][4] His distinctive rhythmic approach and percussion-based compositional style became integral to Jamiroquai's signature sound across seven studio albums, establishing him as a global music figure.[3][4]

Beyond Jamiroquai, Akingbola has maintained an expansive creative practice as a solo artist, composer, and collaborator. He released his debut solo album 'Routes to Roots: Yoruba Drums from Nigeria' in 2007 on ARC Music, exploring traditional Yoruba musical structures.[1][2] His collaborative work spans genres and generations, including recordings with Damon Albarn, Lokua Kanza, Fatoumata Diawara, Newton Faulkner, and Tony Allen.[1][3] He is a two-time BMI Award winner for Best Film and TV Score (2023 and 2024) for his work on the CBS series 'Bob Hearts Abishola,' and has composed original works for the Royal Shakespeare Company and National Theatre.[3] Through his independent label Hipsync Records, Akingbola continues developing what he calls 'Black Atlantic Funk'—a musical form rooted in Yoruba spiritual technologies, diasporic rhythm, and improvisational freedom.[3]

## Fun Facts
- Akingbola was recruited to Jamiroquai through an intriguing phone call from drummer Derrick McKenzie, who was captivated by Sola's unique name and needed someone to immediately fill the percussionist post for a TV show in Paris called Taratata—Sola had just completed an intense eight-month world tour with Ronny Jordan at the time.[1]
- He is a self-taught musician who began his musical career as a dancer and DJ in London's 1980s underground rare groove scene before formally developing his drumming skills.[1]
- Beyond music, Akingbola is an accomplished performer and co-arranger who appeared in theatrical productions at prestigious venues including the National Theatre ('Death and The King's Horseman' in 2010) and the Young Vic ('The Feast' in 2013), directed by Rufus Norris, exploring Yoruba cultural influence throughout the diaspora.[1]
- He is a two-time BMI Award winner for Best Film and TV Score in 2023 and 2024 for his compositional work on the CBS series 'Bob Hearts Abishola.'[3]
