## Biography
Alvin "Shine" Robinson (December 22, 1937 – January 25, 1989) was an American rhythm and blues singer, guitarist, and songwriter based in New Orleans, Louisiana. Born in the heart of the city's vibrant music scene, Robinson established himself as a session musician by the late 1950s, contributing his talents to numerous recordings. His career gained momentum in the early 1960s when he caught the attention of Joe Jones, a successful recording artist who became his manager and secured him a recording contract with Tiger Records, a New York-based label owned by legendary songwriters and producers Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller. Robinson achieved his most notable commercial success in 1964 with a recording of Chris Kenner's "Something You Got," which reached number 52 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, showcasing his distinctive "fantastically bluesy growl."[1]

Throughout the mid-to-late 1960s, Robinson recorded prolifically across multiple labels including Red Bird Records, Blue Cat Records, and Atco Records, establishing himself as a versatile artist and accomplished session guitarist. His 1964 recording of "Down Home Girl," written by Leiber and Stoller, became critically acclaimed and was later famously covered by The Rolling Stones on their 1965 album *The Rolling Stones No. 2*.[1] Robinson's version of "Let The Good Times Roll" inspired covers by Jimi Hendrix, Stevie Ray Vaughan, and Dr. John. Beyond his solo work, Robinson became deeply involved in the New Orleans music community, collaborating extensively with Dr. John and appearing as a guitarist on several of his albums including *Babylon*, *Dr. John's Gumbo*, and *Hollywood Be Thy Name*.[1] He also contributed to recordings by notable artists including Carly Simon, Ringo Starr, and Tom Waits. Despite his considerable talent and prolific output, Robinson never achieved sustained mainstream success, remaining largely underappreciated during his lifetime. He returned to New Orleans in his later years and passed away in 1989 at the age of 51, leaving behind a legacy as one of the finest but most overlooked voices in New Orleans rhythm and blues.[1]
