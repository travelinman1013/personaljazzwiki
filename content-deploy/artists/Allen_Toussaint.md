## Biography
Allen Toussaint was born on January 14, 1938, in the Gert Town neighborhood of New Orleans, Louisiana, into a working-class family deeply rooted in the city’s musical traditions. Largely self-taught on piano, Toussaint was influenced early by the vibrant local scene and began performing as a teenager, quickly gaining recognition for his prodigious talent. By his early twenties, he was hired by Minit Records, where he became a driving force behind the New Orleans R&B sound, producing, writing, arranging, and performing on numerous hits for artists such as Ernie K-Doe, Irma Thomas, and Aaron Neville. 

Toussaint’s career spanned more than six decades, during which he became one of the most influential figures in American music, particularly in rhythm and blues. His sophisticated yet funky arrangements and intelligent lyrics helped define the sound of 1960s New Orleans R&B, and his work as a songwriter and producer reached far beyond the city. He wrote and produced classics like 'Right Place, Wrong Time' for Dr. John and 'Lady Marmalade' for Labelle, and his compositions were recorded by a diverse array of artists, including The Rolling Stones, Paul McCartney, and Patti LaBelle. Toussaint’s solo albums further showcased his unique blend of blues, jazz, funk, and pop, and he remained an active performer and collaborator until his death in 2015.

Toussaint’s legacy is immense: he is remembered as a cornerstone of New Orleans music and a key architect of American popular music. He was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1998 and received numerous other honors, including the National Medal of the Arts. His influence continues to be felt in the work of countless musicians who draw inspiration from his innovative style and enduring contributions.
