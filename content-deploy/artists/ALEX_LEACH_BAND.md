## Biography
The Alex Leach Band, founded in 2019 by Knoxville, Tennessee native Alex Leach and his wife Miranda, is a progressive bluegrass group that blends deep traditional roots with forward-thinking innovation. Alex Leach began his musical journey as a prodigy, becoming a bluegrass DJ at WDVX radio at just nine years old and earning two 'DJ of the Year' awards from the Society for the Preservation of Bluegrass Music of America by age fifteen. His early exposure to bluegrass history and culture shaped his encyclopedic knowledge and authentic Appalachian sound.

Leach's professional career as a musician took off at nineteen when he joined Ralph Stanley II and the Clinch Mountain Boys, contributing banjo, lead vocals, and harmonies. He later played with the Larry Gillis Band before forming The Alex Leach Band with Miranda and a rotating cast of skilled musicians, including JT Coleman (bass), Joshua Gooding (mandolin, vocals), and Brandon Masur (banjo). The band's music draws from a wide range of influences, from The Stanley Brothers and Porter Wagoner to The Beach Boys and Curtis Mayfield, resulting in a sound that is both nostalgic and progressive. Their albums, such as 'I'm the Happiest When I'm Moving' (2021) and 'All The Way' (2022), feature original compositions and inventive covers, earning critical acclaim for their purposeful evolution of the bluegrass genre.

In 2023, Alex Leach disbanded his group and rejoined Ralph Stanley II and the Clinch Mountain Boys as their banjo player, continuing his legacy as both a performer and a bluegrass radio voice. His work is recognized for its authenticity, innovation, and deep respect for bluegrass traditions, positioning him as a bridge between the genre's storied past and its vibrant future.
