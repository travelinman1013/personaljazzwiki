## Biography
BADBADNOTGOOD (BBNG) is a Canadian ensemble formed in 2010 in Toronto, Ontario, originally comprising pianist Matthew Tavares, bassist Chester Hansen, and drummer Alexander Sowinski, with saxophonist Leland Whitty later joining as a full member. The group met at Humber College, bonding over a shared passion for jazz and contemporary hip hop, particularly artists like Odd Future and MF DOOM. Their early notoriety stemmed from viral YouTube videos featuring jazz reinterpretations of hip hop tracks, which challenged academic conventions and quickly attracted a devoted online following.

Their debut album, 'BBNG,' released in 2011, showcased their innovative blend of jazz, hip hop, and electronic influences, featuring covers of Odd Future, A Tribe Called Quest, and Waka Flocka Flame. BADBADNOTGOOD’s reputation grew through energetic live performances and collaborations with prominent artists, most notably the 2015 album 'Sour Soul' with Ghostface Killah. Their 2016 album 'IV' marked the official addition of Whitty and included collaborations with Kaytranada, Mick Jenkins, and Samuel T. Herring. Despite the departure of founding pianist Tavares in 2019, the group has continued to evolve, maintaining a significant influence on the intersection of jazz and hip hop, and inspiring a new generation of genre-blurring musicians.
