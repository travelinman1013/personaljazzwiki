## Biography
Todd Rollins was a dance band leader who led his orchestra during the mid-1930s, a period that marked the height of the swing era and dance band popularity in America. While detailed biographical information about his early life and personal background remains scarce in historical records, his musical output during 1934-1935 has been documented and preserved, providing a glimpse into his work during this golden age of American popular music.

Todd Rollins & His Orchestra recorded extensively during 1934-1935, producing a variety of popular songs typical of the dance band era. The orchestra's repertoire included romantic ballads like "Born To Be Kissed" and "Kissing Games," as well as novelty numbers such as "The Boogie Man" (1934), which later appeared on compilations of vintage Halloween-themed recordings. The band frequently featured vocalist Chick Bullock, who was a prolific singer of the era and lent his voice to many of Rollins's recordings. Their sessions were recorded in New York City, the epicenter of the recording industry during this period, with tracks like "Born To Be Kissed" being laid down on July 18, 1934.

Despite the orchestra's activity during the mid-1930s, Todd Rollins remains a relatively obscure figure in jazz and dance band history compared to contemporaries who achieved greater lasting fame. His recordings have been preserved and occasionally compiled, particularly for collectors interested in the complete spectrum of 1930s dance band music. The limited documentation of his life and career reflects the reality that many dance band leaders of this era, while professionally active and commercially successful in their time, did not leave extensive biographical records for posterity.
