## Biography
WILLIS is an indie rock band originating from Florence, Alabama, formed in 2016 by five schoolmates: Murphy Billings (bass & vocals), Glenn O'Steen (drums), Will O'Steen (synths), Edward Armstead (guitar), and Trey Murphy (guitar). Their musical journey began with a successful first jam session that produced their debut track 'Cydd', quickly establishing their presence in the local scene. Over the years, WILLIS developed a distinctive sound that draws on the rich musical heritage of Muscle Shoals, blending psychedelic indie rock with elements of soul and alternative pop. Their move to Nashville further expanded their reach, and their single 'I Think I Like When It Rains' has amassed over 4 million Spotify streams, marking them as one of the most-streamed independent bands from Alabama in recent years.

The band’s style is characterized by smooth, melodic guitar lines, lush synth textures, and introspective lyrics, often exploring themes of nostalgia, relationships, and personal growth. WILLIS’s music is noted for its laid-back yet emotionally resonant vibe, appealing to fans of modern indie and alternative genres. Their innovative approach has earned them recognition, including a spot on al.com's '25 Essential Alabama Musicians To Know for 2018', and they continue to build a loyal following both regionally and internationally.

Legacy-wise, WILLIS has played a significant role in revitalizing the Muscle Shoals sound for a new generation, blending classic influences with contemporary indie sensibilities. Their commitment to independent production and authentic songwriting has inspired other emerging artists in the region, helping to put Florence, Alabama, on the map as a hub for creative musical talent.
