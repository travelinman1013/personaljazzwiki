## Biography
Daft Punk was a pioneering French electronic music duo formed in Paris by Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo and Thomas Bangalter, who met as teenagers in 1987. Their early collaboration began with a rock band called Darlin', but after a negative review described their sound as 'a daft punky thrash,' they adopted the name Daft Punk and shifted toward electronic music. Their debut album, 'Homework' (1997), was acclaimed for its innovative fusion of house, techno, and electro, featuring hits like 'Around the World' and 'Da Funk.'

With their second album, 'Discovery' (2001), Daft Punk embraced a more melodic, disco-influenced sound and introduced their now-iconic robot personas, further enhancing their mystique. The duo became known for their elaborate live shows, creative music videos, and multimedia projects, including the animated film 'Interstella 5555.' Their 2013 album 'Random Access Memories' marked a return to analog instrumentation and featured the global hit 'Get Lucky.' Over nearly three decades, Daft Punk redefined electronic music, influencing countless artists and winning multiple Grammy Awards before announcing their split in 2021.

Daft Punk's legacy is marked by their commitment to artistic innovation, anonymity, and genre-blending creativity. Their work not only shaped the sound of modern dance music but also left a lasting impact on popular culture through their visual artistry and collaborations across genres.
