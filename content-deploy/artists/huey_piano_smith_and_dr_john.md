## Biography
Huey Pierce 'Piano' Smith (January 26, 1934 – February 13, 2023) was born in New Orleans' Central City neighborhood and showed early musical talent, writing his first song, 'Robertson Street Boogie,' at age eight. Influenced by Professor Longhair's innovative style and boogie-woogie masters like Pete Johnson, Meade Lux Lewis, Albert Ammons, and Jelly Roll Morton, as well as R&B artist Fats Domino, Smith developed a distinctive shuffling right-hand piano technique. He attended Walter L. Cohen High School, began club performances at 15 with Guitar Slim (Eddie Jones), and signed his first recording contract with Savoy Records in 1952 at age 18, releasing 'You Made Me Cry.' By 1955, he played sessions for Little Richard, Lloyd Price, Earl King ('Those Lonely Lonely Nights'), and Smiley Lewis ('I Hear You Knocking').[1][2]

In 1957, Smith formed Huey 'Piano' Smith and His Clowns with vocalist Bobby Marchan, signing with Ace Records under Johnny Vincent, and scored massive hits like 'Rockin' Pneumonia and the Boogie Woogie Flu' (with vocalists Sidney Rayfield and 'Scarface' John Williams) and 'Don't You Just Know It' (No. 9 Billboard Pop, No. 4 R&B). His infectious New Orleans R&B style epitomized rollicking energy, influencing early rock 'n' roll. Post-Ace, he made comebacks with groups like the Hueys and Shindig Smith and the Soul Shakers, including a 1971 'Rockin' Pneumonia' re-recording on Cotillion, but never matched prior success. His last Clowns performance was in 1981 at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, and he received the Rhythm & Blues Foundation Pioneer Award in 2000.[1][2]

Smith's legacy endures through covers of his tunes by Aerosmith, Grateful Dead, Bruce Springsteen, and Deep Purple, and his pivotal role in New Orleans piano R&B. He died at home in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, aged 89.[1][2]

## Fun Facts
- Wrote his first song 'Robertson Street Boogie' at age 8, named after his street, and performed it as 'Slick and Doc' with friend Percy Anderson.[1][2]
- Didn't like his own singing voice, so instructed vocalist 'Scarface' John Williams to 'get in closer' to the mic during 'Rockin' Pneumonia' sessions, saying 'I'm trying to get a hit out of this.'[1]
- Played piano on Little Richard's first band sessions for Specialty Records in 1955 and backed regional hits like Earl King's 'Those Lonely Lonely Nights' and Smiley Lewis' 'I Hear You Knocking'.[1][2]
- Received Rhythm & Blues Foundation Pioneer Award in 2000, performing 'Rockin' Pneumonia' and 'Sea Cruise' (written by him, sung by Frankie Ford) after nearly 20 years off stage.[2]
