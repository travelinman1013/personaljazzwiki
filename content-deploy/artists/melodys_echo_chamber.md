## Biography
Melody's Echo Chamber is the creative project of French musician Melody Prochet, born and raised in Paris, France. Prochet's early musical life was shaped by a family deeply involved in music—her brother was a keyboard enthusiast who introduced her to electronic pioneers like Vangelis and Jean Michel Jarre, and she studied classical music for 12 years before branching into songwriting and performing[2]. Before launching Melody's Echo Chamber, Prochet fronted bands such as My Bee's Garden and The Narcoleptic Dancers, exploring more pop-oriented sounds before discovering the dream pop and neo-psychedelic styles that would define her solo work[2][3].

The genesis of Melody's Echo Chamber came after My Bee's Garden supported Tame Impala on their 2010 European tour, leading to a fruitful collaboration with Tame Impala's Kevin Parker. Together, they recorded the debut album in Parker's home studio in Perth, Australia, and at Prochet's grandmother's seaside home in the south of France. The self-titled album, released in 2012, showcased Prochet's ethereal vocals and lush, psychedelic arrangements, blending analog synths, dreamy guitar textures, and experimental production techniques[1][3]. Subsequent albums, including 'Bon Voyage' (2018) and 'Emotional Eternal' (2022), further developed her sound, incorporating influences from French pop, krautrock, and Scandinavian psych-rock, with collaborations from members of Dungen and other artists[3][4].

Melody's Echo Chamber is celebrated for its unique fusion of dream pop, neo-psychedelia, and experimental rock, marked by Prochet's introspective songwriting and adventurous sonic palette. Despite setbacks—including a serious accident in 2017 that delayed her second album—Prochet's work has left a lasting impact on the modern psychedelic scene, inspiring both fans and fellow musicians with her innovative approach to composition and production[3][4].

## Fun Facts
- Melody Prochet recorded much of her debut album using minimal equipment, including a basic Shure 58 microphone and borrowed gear, resulting in a raw and distinctive sound[2].
- Her second album, Bon Voyage, was delayed after Prochet suffered a serious accident in 2017, but she made a full recovery and released the album in 2018[3][4].
- Prochet's early musical experiments included R&B tracks recorded by her brother in the South of France, a far cry from her later psychedelic style[2].
- She has rarely toured, but when she does, her live band has included acclaimed musicians from the Swedish psych-rock scene, notably members of Dungen[4].
