## Biography
Weather Report was an American jazz fusion band formed in 1970 by keyboardist Joe Zawinul, saxophonist Wayne Shorter, and bassist Miroslav Vitouš. The group emerged from the creative ferment surrounding Miles Davis’s pioneering electric period, with Zawinul and Shorter both contributing to Davis’s landmark albums 'In a Silent Way' and 'Bitches Brew.' Their vision was to push jazz beyond traditional boundaries, blending improvisation with structured compositions and drawing on influences from rock, funk, Latin, and world music.

The band’s early years were marked by an experimental, impressionistic approach, often described as 'we always solo and we never solo.' As the lineup evolved, notably with the addition of virtuoso bassist Jaco Pastorius in 1976, Weather Report’s sound became more groove-oriented and accessible, culminating in the release of 'Heavy Weather' (1977) and the iconic track 'Birdland.' Over their 16-year career, Weather Report released sixteen albums, won a Grammy Award, and became one of the most influential and enduring groups in jazz fusion, known for their electrifying live performances and innovative use of technology.

Weather Report disbanded in 1986, but their legacy endures through their genre-defying recordings and the profound influence they had on subsequent generations of musicians. Their music remains a touchstone for jazz fusion, celebrated for its adventurous spirit, technical mastery, and the creative partnership of Zawinul and Shorter, who remained the band’s core throughout its existence.
