## Biography
Jesse McBride is a distinguished jazz pianist, composer, and educator who has become a central figure in the modern New Orleans jazz scene. Born and raised in Houston, Texas, McBride began his musical journey at an early age, starting with the violin at four before transitioning to piano during his years at the Houston High School for the Performing and Visual Arts, where he studied alongside notable peers such as Robert Glasper[6][1]. His passion for jazz deepened when he moved to New Orleans to attend the University of New Orleans (UNO), where he was mentored by legendary musicians Harold Battiste and Ellis Marsalis[1][5].

McBride's career is marked by his commitment to preserving and advancing the tradition of New Orleans modern jazz. He became the leader of 'The Next Generation,' a jazz ensemble originally founded by Harold Battiste, and has been instrumental in recording and performing works by underappreciated New Orleans composers such as James Black and Clyde Kerr, Jr.[1][4]. Through steady gigs at venues like Snug Harbor and curated concert series such as 'Prime Examples of Excellence in Music,' McBride has provided platforms for both veteran and emerging jazz artists, fostering a vibrant community and ensuring the continuity of the city's unique musical language[2][4].

Known for his laid-back yet intense approach, McBride challenges both himself and his students, blending traditional New Orleans jazz with contemporary influences. His legacy is defined by his dual role as a performer and educator, tirelessly promoting the music and mentoring the next generation of jazz musicians in New Orleans and beyond[1][2].
