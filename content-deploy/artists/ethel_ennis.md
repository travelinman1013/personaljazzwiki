## Biography
Ethel Ennis (1932–2019) was a celebrated American jazz vocalist renowned for her rich, expressive voice and deep ties to her hometown of Baltimore, Maryland. Raised in a devout Methodist household in West Baltimore, Ennis began her musical journey playing piano and singing hymns at Ames United Methodist Church under her mother's guidance. By age 15, she was already performing at nightclubs along Pennsylvania Avenue, a bold move that marked her entry into the world of jazz and blues[2][3].

Ennis released her first single in 1956 and quickly signed with Capitol Records, earning acclaim from jazz luminaries such as Frank Sinatra, Billie Holiday, and Ella Fitzgerald, who called her a favorite among young singers[3]. Throughout her seven-decade career, she shared stages with icons like Duke Ellington, Miles Davis, Benny Goodman, Cab Calloway, and Louis Armstrong, and performed at major events including the Newport Jazz Festival and the inaugurations of Presidents Nixon and Carter[1][2][3]. Despite opportunities for greater commercial fame, Ennis chose to remain rooted in Baltimore, focusing on community engagement and authenticity in her artistry. She co-founded Ethel’s Place, a renowned jazz club, and became known as 'Baltimore’s First Lady of Jazz,' leaving a legacy of musical excellence and civic commitment[1][2].
