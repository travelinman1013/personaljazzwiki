## Biography
Future Cowboys is a genre-bending musical project led by New Orleans singer-songwriter-actor Jamie Bernstein, alongside New York collaborators Eren Cannata and Miguel Oliveira. The trio blends country-esque vocal delivery, protest lyrics, soulful melodies, and modern electronic production, expanding Americana songwriting with hip-hop and electronic techniques. They recorded their debut six-song EP, *Going Kamikaze*, across New Orleans, Sagaponack, New York, and Beverly Hills, California, showcasing anthemic tracks influenced by arena-rock like U2, goth-rock such as Joy Division, and hymn-like Americana.[2][3][4]

Their music explores themes of personal struggle, determination, and fleeting relationships, as heard in songs like 'This One Time,' 'Choose,' 'Work for the Week,' and 'I Fight Alone' from *Going Kamikaze*. Subsequent releases include the album *Life on Mars!*, which takes listeners on a cosmic journey with hypnotic lyric videos, and singles like 'PARTY,' featuring a space cowboy theme with roller-skating visuals and the Soul Brass Band. Miguel Oliveira founded Pantherburn Studios in 2017 to develop new artists, underscoring the group's innovative approach.[4][5][6][7]

As an emerging act with low Spotify popularity (1), Future Cowboys demonstrates major potential through cinematic production and eclectic styles, positioning them as a work in progress in the indie music scene.[2]
