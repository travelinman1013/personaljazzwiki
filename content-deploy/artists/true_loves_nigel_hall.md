## Biography
Nigel David Hall, born September 15, 1981, in Washington, D.C., is an acclaimed American vocalist, keyboardist, and songwriter known for his deep roots in rhythm and blues, soul, funk, and jam music. Raised in a highly musical family, Hall began playing keyboards before kindergarten and was steeped in the traditions of gospel, classic soul, and funk from an early age. His early immersion in music laid the foundation for a career marked by versatility and a deep respect for musical heritage.

Hall's professional journey accelerated in 2007 when he was discovered by Ryan Zoidis, who introduced him to Eric Krasno of Soulive, marking Hall's entry into the broader jam and funk scene. He quickly became a sought-after collaborator, performing with Soulive, Lettuce, and other Royal Family affiliates. Hall's move to New Orleans in 2011 further enriched his artistry, as he absorbed the city's unique musical culture and worked with local legends like Jon Cleary and Cha Wa. He co-founded The Nth Power in 2012, later joining Lettuce full-time in 2015, where he remains a key member. Hall's solo work, including the albums 'Ladies & Gentleman...' and 'Spiritual,' showcases his mastery of retro soul and his ability to blend genres with authenticity and emotional depth.

Throughout his career, Hall has been recognized for both his musicianship and resilience, overcoming personal struggles and emerging as a respected figure in contemporary soul and funk. He has been nominated for Grammy Awards, won the New Orleans Big Easy Award, and performed at major festivals such as the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival and Essence Music Festival. Hall's legacy is defined by his commitment to musical excellence, his collaborative spirit, and his influence on the next generation of soul and funk artists.
