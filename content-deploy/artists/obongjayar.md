## Biography
Obongjayar, born Steven Umoh in Calabar, Nigeria, is a London-based singer and songwriter whose music bridges genres and cultures. Raised by his grandmother after his mother fled an abusive relationship, Umoh grew up immersed in bootleg American rap and gospel music, drawing early inspiration from artists like Eminem, Usher, Nelly, Snoop Dogg, and Ciara. At 17, he moved to England to join his mother, maintaining ties to the Nigerian music scene while studying at university in Norwich. His formative years were marked by a devout Christian upbringing, which later evolved into a broader spiritual outlook that informs his work[1][5].

Obongjayar began his career by uploading tracks to SoundCloud, quickly attracting attention for his distinctive voice and genre-blending style. He was invited by XL Recordings executive Richard Russell to contribute to the 'Everything Is Recorded' project, leading to further collaborations and the release of his debut EP 'Home' in 2016. His subsequent EPs, including 'Bassey' and 'Sweetness' (with producer Sarz), showcased his fusion of afrobeat, soul, and alternative R&B, with lyrics exploring spirituality, identity, and politics. Obongjayar's debut album 'Some Nights I Dream of Doors' (2022) was critically acclaimed and nominated for the Ivor Novello Award for Best Album, followed by 'Paradise Now' in 2025[1][2][4].

Known for his energetic live performances and poetic songwriting, Obongjayar has become a sought-after collaborator in the UK and beyond, working with artists such as Little Simz, Danny Brown, Fred Again, and Pa Salieu. His music is characterized by its spiritual undertones, genre fluidity, and a powerful sense of authenticity, making him a leading figure in the alté movement and a unique voice in contemporary music[1][2][5].
