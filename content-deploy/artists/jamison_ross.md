## Biography
Jamison Ross, born and raised in Jacksonville, Florida, began his musical journey immersed in the church music of his grandfather's congregation, where he sang and started formal drum training encouraged by his mother during elementary and high school at Douglas Anderson School of the Arts. He earned a B.A. in jazz studies from Florida State University and a Master's in jazz studies from the University of New Orleans, refining his skills as a drummer, singer, composer, and bandleader. His breakthrough came in 2012 when he won the Thelonious Monk (now Herbie Hancock) International Jazz Competition for Jazz Drum Set, leading to recordings with Concord Jazz and collaborations with esteemed artists.[1][2][3][5]

Ross surprised many with his 2015 GRAMMY-nominated debut album *Jamison* on Concord Jazz, which showcased his vocal talents on ten of twelve tracks alongside his drumming prowess, blending jazz, R&B, soul, gospel, and blues in a style evoking Marvin Gaye, Rance Allen, and Al Green. He joined the Grammy-winning supergroup Snarky Puppy in 2016, contributing drums to albums like *Live in Rio*, *Family Dinner Volume 2*, *Immigrance*, and *Empire Central*. In 2019, he co-founded Affective Music label and produced Mykal Kilgore’s debut single 'Let Me Go,' earning another GRAMMY nomination; he later won a GRAMMY for producing Avery*Sunshine’s *So Glad To Know You* (Best Progressive R&B Album).[1][2][3][4]

Now based in New Orleans with his wife Adrienne and daughter Jazz, Ross serves as an educator at Loyola University New Orleans, mentoring emerging artists while continuing to evolve soul and jazz through his organic, groove-driven sound that bridges tradition and modernity, establishing him as a multifaceted torchbearer for the genres.[1][2][3]

## Fun Facts
- Won the 2012 Thelonious Monk Competition as a drummer, but shocked audiences with his singing on debut album *Jamison*, where most knew him only as a percussionist.[2][3]
- Family deeply rooted in music: grandfather was a prominent pastor, father a popular songwriter who died when Ross was 9, and mother in church music ministry.[1][4]
- Drummed in high-level gospel with Byron Cage growing up, blending church 'soul' into his jazz and Snarky Puppy work.[4]
- Soul-searching talk with wife Adrienne inspired authentic presentation on debut album after initially downplaying his drumming.[3]
