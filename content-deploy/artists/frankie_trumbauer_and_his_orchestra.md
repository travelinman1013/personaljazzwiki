## Biography
Frankie Trumbauer, born Orie Frank Trumbauer on May 30, 1901, in Carbondale, Illinois, was a pioneering American jazz saxophonist and bandleader whose career flourished in the 1920s and 1930s. Raised in St. Louis, Missouri, by a musically inclined mother who directed saxophone and theater orchestras, Trumbauer was exposed to music from an early age. He began his professional journey with regional dance bands, including Edgar Benson and Ray Miller, and the nationally recognized Mound City Blue Blowers. His early experiences in the Midwest laid the foundation for his later prominence in jazz, particularly through his association with Jean Goldkette’s Orchestra, where he became musical director and recruited the legendary cornetist Bix Beiderbecke[1][2].

Trumbauer’s musical style was defined by his mastery of the C melody saxophone—an instrument uncommon even in his time—which gave his playing a distinctive, cool, and lyrical quality. He led his own orchestra and made a series of influential recordings for OKeh, often featuring Beiderbecke and guitarist Eddie Lang. Their 1927 recording of “Singin’ the Blues” is considered a landmark in jazz history and was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. Trumbauer’s approach, characterized by sophisticated melodies and a restrained, intellectual style, prefigured the cool jazz movement of the 1950s and 1960s and directly influenced saxophonists like Lester Young[1][3]. Despite his innovative contributions, Trumbauer’s orchestra was never a major commercial success, and after a period with Paul Whiteman’s Orchestra and leading his own bands, he left music during World War II to work as a test pilot, only returning sporadically to recording afterward[1][3].

## Fun Facts
- Trumbauer was one of the few prominent jazz musicians to specialize in the C melody saxophone, an instrument that fell out of favor after the 1920s[1][3].
- During World War II, he left music to work as a test pilot for North American Aviation, showcasing a passion for aviation alongside his musical career[2][3].
- Trumbauer’s 1927 recording of “Singin’ the Blues” with Bix Beiderbecke is often cited as one of the first great jazz ballad performances and was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1977[1].
- He was featured in Ken Burns’ 2001 documentary *Jazz* as an iconic figure representing early jazz soloists[1].
