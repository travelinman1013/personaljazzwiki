## Biography
Sabertooth Swing is a New Orleans-based swing jazz ensemble founded by guitarist and producer Romain Beauxis. The band traces its origins to the vibrant local swing dance community, where their energetic performances quickly became a staple for dancers and jazz aficionados alike[1][2][6]. Drawing from the rich musical heritage of New Orleans, Sabertooth Swing blends traditional swing idioms with modern arrangements, infusing their sound with influences from blues, zydeco, Cajun, and Caribbean styles[5][6]. Their musicianship is marked by a commitment to both fun and depth, offering music that is equally suited for lively dancing or serious listening[1][2].

The group’s career development is highlighted by ambitious projects such as their second album, 'Delta Bound,' which explores the complex history of violence and cultural confluence in Louisiana through a mix of original compositions, traditional songs, and spoken word collaborations with poets, activists, and historical figures[3][5][10]. Sabertooth Swing’s lineup includes core members and a rotating cast of guest artists, contributing to the diversity and richness of their recordings. Their most recent EP, 'Songs of Future Past,' emerged from late-night blues dance sessions and was shaped by the pandemic, reflecting themes of time, memory, and storytelling[1].

Sabertooth Swing’s legacy is rooted in their ability to bridge eras and genres, honoring the footpath of jazz originators like Buddy Bolden while pushing the boundaries of swing music in contemporary contexts[1][5]. Their work is recognized for its expressive arrangements, thoughtful lyrical themes, and commitment to exploring the social and historical dimensions of American music, making them a distinctive voice in the New Orleans jazz scene.
