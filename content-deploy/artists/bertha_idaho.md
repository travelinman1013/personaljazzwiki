## Biography
Bertha Idaho, born around 1895 with date of death unknown, was an American classic female blues singer active during the late 1920s.[1][3] Little is known about her early life or personal background, as historical records primarily focus on her brief recording career.[1][3][4] She emerged in the classic blues era, a period dominated by female vocalists performing vaudeville-influenced blues with jazz accompaniment.[1]

Idaho's career was remarkably short, limited to just four songs recorded in 1928 and 1929.[1][3] These recordings represent the entirety of her documented output, aligning with the classic female blues style characterized by emotive vocals and piano or small ensemble backing typical of the era.[4][5] No details exist on her live performances, travels, or reasons for her abrupt exit from the music scene, leaving her professional trajectory enigmatic.[1][3]

Her legacy endures through these rare tracks, preserved in music databases and streaming platforms, though her popularity remains negligible today.[1][5] Bertha Idaho exemplifies the many obscure artists of the classic blues period whose contributions are overshadowed by contemporaries like Bessie Smith or Ma Rainey, with her stage name playfully evoking Idaho's famous potatoes in biographical notes.[5][6]
