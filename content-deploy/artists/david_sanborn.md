## Biography
David Sanborn (1945–2024) was an iconic American alto saxophonist whose signature sound blended traditional jazz, instrumental pop, and R&B, earning him a place among the most influential musicians of his era. Born in Tampa, Florida, on July 30, 1945, Sanborn spent his childhood in Kirkwood, Missouri, where he was profoundly shaped by the St. Louis blues scene. At age three, he contracted polio, which attacked his lungs, arm, and leg. At age 11, as part of his therapeutic treatment, doctors encouraged him to take up a wind instrument to strengthen his chest and improve his breathing. Enchanted by the sound of alto saxophonist Hank Crawford and other Chicago blues artists, Sanborn embraced the saxophone with passion. By age 14, he was already performing with blues legends Albert King and Little Milton, demonstrating prodigious talent that would define his trajectory.

Sanborn's professional career accelerated rapidly after he studied music at Northwestern University under Professor Frederick Hemke, then transferred to the University of Iowa, where he worked closely with acclaimed saxophonist J.R. Monterose. He joined the Paul Butterfield Blues Band in the late 1960s, appearing on four of their albums and performing at Woodstock on August 18, 1969. By the mid-1970s, his saxophone could be heard on recordings by David Bowie (including the famous solo on "Young Americans"), Stevie Wonder, Bruce Springsteen, Aretha Franklin, the Eagles, James Brown, the Rolling Stones, and dozens of other major artists. He released his first solo album, *Taking Off*, in 1975, which solidified his solo career. His 1979 album *Hideaway* featured the hit single "Seduction," which was featured in the film *American Gigolo*. Throughout his nearly 60-year career, Sanborn released 25 albums, won six Grammy Awards (four consecutively in the mid-to-late 1980s), and earned eight gold albums and one platinum album.

Sanborn became a reluctant giant of smooth jazz in the 1980s, setting a sturdy template for the radio format with crossover hits and more than a dozen albums breaking into the Billboard 200. His sound was distinctive—sweet-tart with a bracing bite, adapted from his childhood hero Hank Crawford but made as personal as his speaking voice. He maintained an insistent connection with the jazz tradition throughout his career, co-hosting the late-night music variety show *Night Music* with Jools Holland in the late 1980s, and later reuniting with collaborator Bob James for the straight-ahead jazz album *Quartette Humaine* in 2013. Sanborn died on May 12, 2024, in Tarrytown, New York, at age 78, after a six-year battle with prostate cancer that began in 2018.

## Fun Facts
- Sanborn contracted polio at age three, which attacked his lungs, arm, and leg. The saxophone was introduced to him at age 11 as part of his therapeutic treatment to strengthen his chest and improve his breathing—what began as medical therapy became his life's passion and career.
- Sanborn performed at Woodstock in the early morning hours of August 18, 1969, as a member of the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, appearing on the album but not in the famous documentary film due to the timing of his performance.
- According to a 1988 interview in DownBeat magazine, Sanborn had a specific preference for Selmer Mark VI alto saxophones in the 140,000-150,000 serial number range, all produced in 1967—a very particular choice that reflected his meticulous approach to his instrument.
- Though Sanborn became a reluctant giant of smooth jazz in the 1980s and won four consecutive Grammy Awards during the mid-to-late 1980s, he himself never warmed to the term 'smooth jazz,' preferring to describe his work as blending jazz with instrumental pop and R&B.
