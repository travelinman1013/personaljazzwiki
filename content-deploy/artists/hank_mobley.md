## Biography
Henry "Hank" Mobley was born on July 7, 1930, in Eastman, Georgia, and grew up primarily in Elizabeth, New Jersey. Coming from a musically inclined family with several members who played piano and church organ, Mobley initially learned piano as a child before switching to saxophone at age 16. He quickly developed his craft by studying the styles of Lester Young, Charlie Parker, Dexter Gordon, Don Byas, and Sonny Stitt, and began playing professionally in the Newark area. His early reputation grew so strong that trumpeter Clifford Brown recommended him for a job without having heard him play, leading to Mobley joining Paul Gayten's R&B band in 1949.

Mobley's career trajectory accelerated through the early 1950s as he performed with Max Roach, Dizzy Gillespie, and other jazz luminaries. His most significant contribution came as a charter member of Horace Silver's Jazz Messengers (co-led with Art Blakey), where he helped inaugurate the hard bop movement with their groundbreaking 1955 album "Horace Silver and the Jazz Messengers." This music balanced sophistication and soulfulness, combining complex harmonies with earthy swing. Signing with Blue Note Records in 1955, Mobley recorded prolifically over the next 15 years, producing landmark albums like "Soul Station" (1960), "No Room for Squares," and "A Caddy for Daddy." He briefly joined Miles Davis's group in 1961, appearing on "Someday My Prince Will Come" and live recordings from The Blackhawk, though his tenure was short-lived as Davis sought a replacement for John Coltrane.

Critic Leonard Feather famously dubbed Mobley the "middleweight champion of the tenor saxophone," referring to his distinctive "round" tone that occupied a middle ground between the aggressive sounds of John Coltrane and Sonny Rollins and the softer, cooler approach of Stan Getz and Lester Young. His controlled, even sound prioritized subtlety over intense emotional displays, with solo lines full of intricate rhythmic patterns delivered with precision. Despite lacking the galvanizing qualities of some tenor innovators, Mobley remained consistently solid throughout his career, forming particularly productive partnerships with trumpeter Lee Morgan and recording 25 albums for Blue Note between 1955 and 1970. Drug problems arrested his momentum in 1958, taking him off the scene for a year, and lung problems forced his retirement in the mid-1970s. He died of pneumonia on May 30, 1986, in Philadelphia at age 55, leaving behind a legacy as one of hard bop's most important yet somewhat underappreciated voices.

## Fun Facts
- Trumpeter Clifford Brown recommended Mobley for a job without ever having heard him play, such was his reputation in the Newark jazz scene.
- Mobley described his distinctive saxophone tone as 'not a big sound, not a small sound, but a round sound,' which set him apart from both aggressive players like Coltrane and softer players like Stan Getz.
- He served two weeks in Duke Ellington's orchestra in 1953, briefly playing with one of jazz's most legendary bandleaders.
- Mobley was not only a saxophonist but also a skilled composer who often wrote his own material for his recordings, doubling as a composer during his time with Paul Gayten's R&B band starting in 1949.
- A worsening drug problem led to an arrest in 1958 that took him off the jazz scene for a year, just as he was hitting his stride with albums like 'Peckin' Time.'
