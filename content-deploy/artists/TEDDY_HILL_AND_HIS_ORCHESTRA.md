## Biography
Teddy Hill (December 7, 1909 – May 19, 1978) was an influential American big band leader and jazz impresario, best known for his pivotal role in the development of bebop and for managing the legendary Minton's Playhouse in Harlem. Born in Birmingham, Alabama, Hill began his musical journey playing drums, clarinet, and saxophone, and moved to New York City in the late 1920s. He gained early experience performing with the Whitman Sisters and George Howe, later joining Luis Russell's orchestra, before forming his own band in 1934.

Hill's orchestra quickly became a fixture in the New York jazz scene, performing regularly at the Savoy Ballroom and broadcasting over NBC radio. His band was notable for nurturing young talent, including Roy Eldridge, Chu Berry, Dicky Wells, Bill Coleman, and a young Dizzy Gillespie, who recorded his first solos with Hill. The band toured Europe in 1937, further cementing its reputation. In 1940, Hill transitioned from bandleading to become the manager of Minton's Playhouse, which under his stewardship became the crucible for the bebop revolution, hosting experimental jam sessions with future jazz legends like Thelonious Monk and Kenny Clarke.

Musically, Hill's orchestra bridged the swing era and the emerging modern jazz movement, blending big band arrangements with innovative soloing. His legacy is twofold: as a bandleader who provided a platform for rising stars, and as a club manager who fostered the creative environment that gave birth to bebop, influencing generations of jazz musicians.
