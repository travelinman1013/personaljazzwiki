## Biography
Billy Bang, born William Vincent Walker on September 20, 1947, in Mobile, Alabama, was a pioneering American free jazz violinist and composer whose life and music were deeply shaped by his experiences and the cultural ferment of his times[1][5]. His family moved to New York City’s Bronx neighborhood while he was still an infant, and as a child, he attended a special music school in Harlem where he was assigned the violin—an instrument he initially resisted but would later master[5]. After a brief stint with the violin as a teenager, Bang abandoned music when he was drafted into the U.S. Army and sent to Vietnam, where he served as a 'tunnel rat' and was profoundly affected by the trauma of war[2][4]. Upon returning to New York in 1968, Bang struggled with addiction and post-war trauma before rediscovering music as a form of therapy and political expression, immersing himself in the city’s vibrant loft jazz scene[4]. Inspired by the unconventional approaches of Leroy Jenkins and Ornette Coleman, Bang developed a unique, percussive, and highly expressive violin style that expanded the role of the instrument in jazz[2][4]. He co-founded the String Trio of New York in 1977 and became a central figure in the avant-garde jazz community, recording and performing with luminaries such as Sun Ra, Don Cherry, and William Parker[2][3]. Bang’s later work, particularly the albums 'Vietnam: The Aftermath' (2001) and 'Vietnam: Reflections' (2005), directly addressed his wartime experiences, blending jazz traditions with Vietnamese musical elements and earning critical acclaim[2][4]. He continued to perform and record until his death on April 11, 2011, leaving behind a legacy as one of jazz’s most original and emotionally resonant voices[1][2].

## Fun Facts
- Bang acquired his nickname from a popular cartoon character as a child, due to his small stature and the instrument he was assigned at music school[5].
- After returning from Vietnam, Bang became an arms expert for revolutionary political groups before music became his salvation[4].
- Bang’s Vietnam-themed albums are considered groundbreaking for their fusion of jazz with Vietnamese pentatonic scales and their deeply personal exploration of trauma and memory[2][4].
- Despite his avant-garde reputation, Bang also played on Bootsy Collins’ comeback album, showcasing his stylistic versatility[3].
