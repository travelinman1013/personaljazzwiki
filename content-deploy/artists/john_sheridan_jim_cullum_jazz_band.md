## Biography
John Sheridan (1946-2021) was an American stride and swing pianist, arranger, and bandleader born in Columbus, Ohio. He developed an early interest in jazz at age eight upon hearing recordings that inspired him, and as a teenager began playing in local groups. Sheridan served in the U.S. Navy Band in Washington, D.C., from 1968 to 1972, after which he moved to Dallas, Texas, to pursue graduate studies at North Texas State University (now University of North Texas), earning a Master's degree in Music in 1977.[1][3][4][5]

Sheridan joined the Jim Cullum Jazz Band in the late 1970s (around 1977-1979), becoming a cornerstone member for over two decades until 2002, serving as pianist, chief arranger, and occasional vocalist. His hundreds of arrangements elevated the band's sound, featured prominently in their 'Riverwalk: Live From The Landing' NPR radio broadcasts from San Antonio's Riverwalk venue. After departing, he freelanced at jazz parties, cruises, and festivals, led his own Dream Band (recording five albums for Arbors Records with vocalist Rebecca Kilgore), and returned occasionally to the Cullum band post-2011. He also arranged for vocalist Banu Gibson's symphony pops concerts and wrote symphonic orchestrations.[1][2][3]

Renowned for his masterful stride piano and world-class arranging in traditional jazz styles influenced by Bix Beiderbecke and Bob Haggart, Sheridan's legacy includes key recordings like the Cullum band's 'Porgy & Bess' and Christmas albums, plus his Dream Band's 'All The Cats Join In.' He passed away on August 24, 2021, after battling cancer, leaving a profound impact on classic jazz.[1][3]
