## Biography
Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong's collaboration represents one of jazz music's most legendary partnerships. Ella Fitzgerald, born in 1917, rose to prominence as a vocalist with drummer Chick Webb's group before establishing herself as one of the greatest jazz singers of the 20th century, known for her crystal-clear phrasing, wide-ranging style, and improvisational versatility. Louis Armstrong, born in 1901, was a pioneering jazz innovator and ambassador who revolutionized the genre through his distinctive trumpet playing and gravelly vocal style. The two first recorded together in 1946 for Decca Records, but their most celebrated collaboration came in 1956 when producer Norman Granz reunited them for a series of studio albums that would define classic vocal jazz. Their partnership produced three official studio albums: Ella and Louis (1956), Ella and Louis Again (1957), and Porgy and Bess (1959), each achieving both critical and commercial success. Despite their seemingly incompatible vocal styles—Armstrong's coarse rasp contrasting with Fitzgerald's graceful, melodic voice—the two created an irresistibly endearing musical symbiosis that became a highlight of 1950s jazz. Their collaboration continued until Armstrong's death, cementing their legacy as two of the greatest artists of the century and establishing a standard for vocal jazz duets that remains unmatched.

## Fun Facts
- Ella Fitzgerald insisted that Louis Armstrong select all the songs and keys for their first album, even singing in keys that weren't ideal for her voice, out of respect for her idol and to ensure he felt comfortable in the studio.
- The entire first Ella and Louis album was recorded in just one day—August 16, 1956—at Capitol Studios in Hollywood, the day after the duo performed together at one of Norman Granz's memorable Jazz at the Philharmonic concerts at the Hollywood Bowl.
- Despite their seemingly incompatible vocal styles on paper—Armstrong's guttural growl contrasting with Fitzgerald's graceful, crystal-clear phrasing—their distinctive voices complemented each other remarkably well, creating what music critic David Rickert called 'a match made in heaven.'
- Porgy and Bess, their third and final collaboration featuring songs from the Gershwin opera of the same name, became their most famous collaboration and was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2001.
