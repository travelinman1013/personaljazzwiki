## Biography
Willie Hightower is a celebrated American soul and R&B singer, born in 1940 in Gadsden, Alabama. His musical journey began in the church at age six, where he honed his vocal skills before transitioning to rhythm and blues performances in local clubs by the time he was eighteen. Hightower's early career was shaped by his work with WENN-AM radio personality Shelley Stewart, who became his manager and helped secure a pivotal connection with New York producer Bobby Robinson. This partnership led to Hightower's first recordings and his eventual signing with Capitol Records, resulting in his 1965 debut single 'It's Too Late' and subsequent national recognition with hits like 'It's A Miracle' and 'Walk A Mile in My Shoes.'[1][4][5][6]

Throughout his career, Hightower distinguished himself with a style deeply rooted in Southern soul, gospel, and R&B, drawing comparisons to Sam Cooke for his emotive, smooth vocal delivery. His work with legendary producers such as Rick Hall at Muscle Shoals and Quinton Claunch further cemented his reputation as a soulful interpreter and songwriter. After a period of touring with the Drifters and forming a family band with his daughters, Hightower made a notable comeback with the 2018 album 'Out of the Blue,' blending country soul with classic R&B and gospel influences. His enduring artistry and commitment to authentic soul music have earned him a lasting legacy in the genre.[1][2][6]
