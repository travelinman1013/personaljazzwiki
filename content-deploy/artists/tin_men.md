## Biography
The Tin Men are America's premier sousaphone, washboard, and guitar trio, representing one of the most distinctive and innovative instrumental combinations in contemporary music. Formed in 2002, the band emerged from New Orleans and has become a celebrated fixture in the city's vibrant music scene. The group consists of three highly respected musicians: guitarist and vocalist Alex McMurray, a natural songwriter known for crafting original compositions that feel like instant classics; sousaphonist Matt Perrine, recognized as one of the finest sousaphone players in the country; and percussionist/vocalist Washboard Chaz Leary, a New Orleans rhythm institution whose seemingly boundless charm and technical prowess anchor the band's infectious energy.

Over more than two decades of performing, The Tin Men have developed a signature sound that defies easy categorization, drawing from an eclectic array of North American musical traditions including jug band, swing jazz, New Orleans R&B, Motown, easy listening, and even heavy metal. Their approach involves taking familiar material from diverse genres and applying their own zany, creative spin to make it distinctly their own. The band has released multiple albums, including 2003's Super Great Music for Modern Lovers, 2005's Freaks For Industry, 2013's Avocado Woo Woo, and more recently Hit It, a collection of covers and McMurray originals that showcases their funkadelic sensibilities. They have been described by Offbeat Magazine as "one of the most interesting bands to emerge from New Orleans in years," and their work has earned them respect both as individual instrumentalists and as a cohesive ensemble.

The Tin Men's legacy lies in their ability to prove that unconventional instrumentation can produce compelling, entertaining, and musically sophisticated results. Their performances are characterized by joyous energy, technical mastery, and an infectious enthusiasm that has made them popular performers at major New Orleans events and venues. The band's continued activity, including appearances on the Big Easy Cruise 2025, demonstrates their enduring relevance and appeal to audiences who appreciate innovative approaches to traditional American musical forms.

## Fun Facts
- The Tin Men's unusual instrumentation combination of sousaphone, washboard, and guitar is so distinctive that it has been described as surprising there aren't more bands attempting this configuration, yet few would dare compete with these heavy-hitters.
- The band's 2013 album was titled Avocado Woo Woo, demonstrating their playful and unconventional approach to album naming and artistic expression.
- Despite their innovative and eclectic musical approach, The Tin Men maintain relatively low mainstream visibility with a Spotify popularity rating of only 2, suggesting they remain a cult favorite among dedicated New Orleans music enthusiasts rather than a widely known act.
- The band has successfully performed covers ranging from Led Zeppelin's 'Misty Mountain Hop' to Allen Toussaint's 'Life' to the classic 'We'll Meet Again,' showcasing their ability to adapt their unique sound across vastly different musical genres and eras.
