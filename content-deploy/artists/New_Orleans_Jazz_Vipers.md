## Biography
The New Orleans Jazz Vipers are a renowned swing band formed in 1999 in New Orleans, Louisiana, by saxophonist and vocalist Joe Braun. The group emerged from the vibrant street music scene of Jackson Square, where Braun and early collaborators like John Rodli and Robert Snow honed their craft alongside legendary local musicians. Their initial performances took place in intimate French Quarter bars, playing for eclectic crowds and quickly gaining a following among local swing dancers and jazz aficionados.

As pioneers of the 'Frenchmen Street Swing Renaissance,' the Jazz Vipers became the first jazz band to play at the now-iconic Spotted Cat Music Club, establishing a long-running weekly residency that helped revitalize New Orleans’ live jazz scene. Their repertoire draws from swing-era greats such as Billie Holiday, Duke Ellington, and Louis Armstrong, as well as original compositions. The band’s energetic, dance-friendly style and commitment to traditional jazz have earned them multiple awards, including Offbeat Magazine’s Best of the Beat and the Big Easy Award for Best Traditional Jazz Band. After Hurricane Katrina, the Vipers were among the first bands to return to New Orleans, performing even when the city was still without electricity, and their resilience became emblematic of the city’s musical spirit.

Over the years, the Jazz Vipers have seen numerous lineup changes, featuring many of New Orleans’ top jazz musicians. Their music has been featured on HBO’s 'Treme,' and their original song 'I Hope You’re Coming Back to New Orleans' was included in the show's Grammy-nominated soundtrack. Today, the band continues to perform regularly, maintaining their status as a cornerstone of New Orleans swing and traditional jazz.
