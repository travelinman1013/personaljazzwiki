## Biography
Jared Pellerin, known professionally as Pell, is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, and producer born on May 29, 1992, in New Orleans, Louisiana. Pell's early life was shaped by the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, which forced him and his family to relocate from New Orleans to Jackson, Mississippi. Living with extended family in a crowded home, Pell turned to music as both a creative outlet and a way to connect with new peers. He began experimenting with a beat machine and performing with friends during his time at St. Joseph Catholic School, later continuing his musical pursuits at Mississippi State University, where he met his manager, Jacob Reed.[1][6][7]

Pell's career took off with the release of his debut project, 'Floating While Dreaming,' in 2014, which received critical acclaim as one of the top independent releases of the year. His track 'Eleven:11' was remixed by G-Eazy, further boosting his profile. Pell's first full-length LP, 'LIMBO,' was released in 2015, followed by the experimental 'girasoul' EP in 2017. He is known for blending alternative hip-hop, R&B, and electronic influences, creating a soulful and upbeat sound that reflects both his New Orleans roots and his personal journey. Pell has performed alongside artists such as Doja Cat, Kehlani, and PJ Morton, and is a founding member of the New Orleans-based collective Glbl Wrmng, which aims to support the local music scene and promote sustainability.[1][2][4]

Pell's legacy is marked by his innovative approach to genre, his commitment to community, and his willingness to push creative boundaries. He has amassed over 200 million streams and continues to evolve artistically, most recently venturing into musical theater with 'The Pellarious Pursuit,' a pioneering 'Hip-Hopera.' Pell remains an influential figure in the contemporary hip-hop and neo-soul scenes, inspiring a new generation of artists from New Orleans and beyond.[2][4]
