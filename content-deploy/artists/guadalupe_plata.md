## Biography
Guadalupe Plata is a blues rock trio hailing from Úbeda, Jaén, in the Andalusia region of southern Spain. The band was formed by Pedro de Dios (guitar, vocals), Carlos Jimena (drums, percussion), and Paco Luis Martos (washtub bass, electric bass, guitars). Their name pays homage to the Virgin patron of their hometown, and their early musical memories are deeply rooted in the religious processions and folk traditions of Andalusia, which blend with their later influences from American blues and rock'n'roll.[2]

Since their inception in the late 2000s, Guadalupe Plata has carved out a distinctive sound that fuses raw, gritty blues with psychedelic and space rock elements, often described as 'desert blues' or 'rockabilly noir.' Their music is characterized by hypnotic rhythms, primitive instrumentation, and a haunting, almost mystical atmosphere. The band has released several acclaimed albums, including their self-titled debut in 2008 and subsequent records in 2011, 2013, and 2018, each marked by their signature blend of Andalusian folklore and Mississippi blues. Their 2021 album, 'The Devil Can't Do You No Harm,' further explores experimental territory while retaining their core sound.[1][2][3]

Guadalupe Plata is renowned for their electrifying live performances, having played at major Spanish festivals like Festival Montgorock and Cooltural Fest, as well as embarking on international tours, including a notable UK circuit in 2017. Their legacy lies in their ability to channel the spirit of traditional blues through a uniquely Spanish lens, earning them a reputation as one of Spain's most innovative and enduring blues rock acts.[1][2]

## Fun Facts
- Guadalupe Plata's washtub bass is a homemade instrument, contributing to their raw, primitive sound.[2]
- The band takes its name from the Virgin of Guadalupe, the patron saint of their hometown Úbeda, and their music is often described in spiritual or mystical terms.[2]
- They have a tradition of naming their albums after the band, with each self-titled record distinguished by its cover color (e.g., 'the red Guadalupe Plata,' 'the black Guadalupe Plata').[2]
- Their song 'Corral' was inspired by an old friend from Úbeda and features lyrics suggested by him as a long-promised tribute.[3]
