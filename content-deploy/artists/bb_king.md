## Biography
B.B. King, born Riley B. King on September 16, 1925, near Itta Bena, Mississippi, grew up in the heart of the Mississippi Delta, where gospel music and the blues shaped his early musical sensibilities[3][2]. After serving in World War II, King moved to Memphis, Tennessee, and began his career as a disc jockey at WDIA, earning the nickname 'Beale Street Blues Boy,' later shortened to 'B.B.'[1][3]. He taught himself guitar and was soon performing in juke joints and on local radio, drawing inspiration from Delta blues and jazz guitarists[3][2].

King's breakthrough came with his 1952 hit '3 O'Clock Blues,' which launched him into national prominence and led to a prolific recording career with a string of rhythm and blues hits throughout the 1950s and 1960s[2][3]. His signature style—marked by fluid string bending, shimmering vibrato, and staccato picking—became a model for electric blues guitarists and influenced generations of musicians[2]. King was renowned for his tireless touring schedule, sometimes performing more than 300 shows a year, and for his dynamic live performances, such as the seminal album 'Live at the Regal' recorded in Chicago in 1964[2][3].

B.B. King's legacy as 'The King of the Blues' is cemented by his role as a principal figure in the development of modern blues and his influence on rock and popular music[2][3]. He won 15 Grammy Awards, was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987, and continued to perform and collaborate with artists across genres until his death in Las Vegas, Nevada, on May 14, 2015[2][3][1].
