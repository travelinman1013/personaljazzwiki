# Billy Bang Sextet

## Biography
Billy Bang, born William Vincent Walker on September 20, 1947, in Mobile, Alabama, moved to New York City's Bronx as an infant and later Harlem, where he attended a special school for musicians. Assigned the violin due to his small stature—despite preferring saxophone or drums—he earned the nickname 'Billy Bang' from a cartoon character and began playing percussion influenced by Puerto Rican and Afro-Cuban communities before focusing on violin in junior high.[1][3] After a traumatic Vietnam War tour as a 'tunnel rat' in 1967-1968, he returned haunted, struggled with addiction, briefly pursued law school on the G.I. Bill, and became an arms expert for revolutionary groups before rediscovering the violin in a pawn shop, which became therapeutic.[2][5]

Radicalized by the anti-war movement, Bang immersed himself in New York's 1970s loft-jazz scene, studying privately with Leroy Jenkins at Queens College and forming the Survival Ensemble. He co-founded the String Trio of New York in 1977 with James Emery and John Lindberg, toured briefly with Sun Ra's Arkestra starting in 1982 for a decade, and collaborated across free jazz, avant-garde, and funk with groups like Decoding Society, Material, and Forbidden Planet. His style blended free jazz intensity with hard bop roots, drawing from Ornette Coleman and Jenkins, and he released over 30 albums, including the Vietnam-themed *Vietnam: The Aftermath* (2001) and *Vietnam: Reflections* (2005).[1][3][4][5]

Bang lived in Berlin from 1996-2000, toured extensively in Europe and the US with partners like Abbey Rader and Kahil El'Zabar, and continued leading groups like the FAB Trio with Joe Fonda and Barry Altschul until his death on April 11, 2011, in Harlem from lung cancer. His legacy endures as a pioneering free jazz violinist who channeled personal trauma into revolutionary, expressive music, influencing the avant-garde scene.[1][3]

## Fun Facts
- Billy Bang bought his signature violin from a pawn shop while on a mission to purchase guns for revolutionary groups, turning it into a tool for musical therapy post-Vietnam.[5]
- He served as a 'tunnel rat' in Vietnam, armed only with a flashlight and pistol, an experience that haunted him and inspired albums like *Vietnam: Reflections* featuring Vietnamese musicians.[2][5]
- Bang debuted the Billy Bang Sextet in 1979 with the LP *The Nagual Julian*, expanding his free jazz explorations.[5]
- Despite his small size, he was assigned violin at school because larger instruments like saxophone or drums were unavailable, leading to his lifelong instrument.[1]
