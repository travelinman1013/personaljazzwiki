## Biography
Jorge Duílio Lima Menezes, known as Jorge Ben or Jorge Ben Jor, was born on March 22, 1939, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, specifically in neighborhoods like Madureira or raised in Catumbi, to a stevedore father and part-Ethiopian mother in a musical household. Growing up singing in church choirs and initially pursuing football with Clube de Regatas do Flamengo, he turned to music after professional sports didn't pan out, learning guitar to play bossa nova and rock 'n' roll. Discovered in Copacabana clubs, he debuted in 1963 with the single 'Mas Que Nada' and album Samba Esquema Novo alongside Meirelles e os Copa Cinco, pioneering samba-rock by fusing samba with electric guitar and rock elements.[1][2][4][5]

His career evolved through the 1960s amid challenges: Philips pressured rapid releases post-debut, leading to three albums in 18 months and his departure after Big Ben (1965). He briefly joined Sérgio Mendes in the US, appeared in a Mission: Impossible episode, and returned inspired by Mendes' hit cover of 'Mas Que Nada.' Moving to São Paulo, he embraced Jovem Guarda with Roberto Carlos and Erasmo Carlos on O Bidú: Silêncio No Brooklin (1967), then re-signed with Philips in 1969 via Gilberto Gil and Caetano Veloso, releasing landmark albums Jorge Ben (1969) and Fôrça Bruta (1970) during Tropicália. His style bridged bossa nova, samba, rock, funk, and MPB, earning him 5th greatest Brazilian artist by Rolling Stone Brazil.[1][2][3][4]

Jorge Ben Jor's legacy as samba-rock's father endures, influencing MPB's transformation and new generations. Ranked among Brazil's top guitarists, his opportunistic adaptations shaped 1960s music, from samba-rock to tropicália precursors, with hits like 'Chove Chuva' and covers by global artists solidifying his impact.[1][2][4]
