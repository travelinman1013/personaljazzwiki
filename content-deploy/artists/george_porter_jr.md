## Biography
George Porter Jr. (born December 26, 1947, in New Orleans, Louisiana) is an iconic American bassist, vocalist, and songwriter, best known as a founding member of The Meters. Raised in a musically rich environment—his father was a Duke Ellington fan and his mother sang in the church choir—Porter grew up in New Orleans alongside future Meters drummer Joseph 'Zigaboo' Modeliste. Inspired by local musicians such as Benjamin 'Poppi' Francis, who gave him his first bass lessons, Porter began performing as a teenager and soon became a fixture in the vibrant New Orleans music scene.[1]

In the mid-1960s, Porter co-founded The Meters with Art Neville, Leo Nocentelli, and Modeliste. The group quickly became recognized as one of the progenitors of funk, blending syncopated polyrhythms and deep grooves rooted in New Orleans' African musical heritage. The Meters' signature sound, exemplified by tracks like 'Cissy Strut,' not only defined the New Orleans funk genre but also influenced generations of musicians worldwide. As the house band for Allen Toussaint’s label, The Meters backed artists such as Dr. John, Paul McCartney, Lee Dorsey, and Patti LaBelle, and toured with the Rolling Stones. After the original band's breakup in 1977, Porter continued his prolific career with projects like the Funky Meters, Runnin’ Pardners, and numerous collaborations across genres.[1][3][5]

Porter's legacy extends far beyond his own recordings; his bass lines have been sampled by hip-hop legends and his influence is cited by artists ranging from the Red Hot Chili Peppers to the Beastie Boys. A Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award recipient, Porter remains a cornerstone of the New Orleans music community, celebrated for his deep rhythmic sensibility and enduring contributions to American music.[3][5]
