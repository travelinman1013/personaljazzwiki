## Biography
Louis Prima (December 7, 1910 – August 24, 1978) was a dynamic American trumpeter, singer, songwriter, and bandleader born in the French Quarter of New Orleans. Raised in a musical Italian-American family, Prima began playing trumpet professionally as a teenager, drawing early inspiration from jazz greats like Louis Armstrong and King Oliver. By the 1930s, he had moved to New York City, where he formed The New Orleans Gang and became a fixture at the Famous Door on 52nd Street, quickly gaining recognition for his energetic performances and unique blend of New Orleans jazz and swing.[1][5]

Prima's career spanned several decades and musical styles. In the 1930s and 1940s, he led successful swing combos and big bands, composing enduring hits such as 'Sing, Sing, Sing'—a song that would become a swing era classic after being popularized by Benny Goodman. Throughout the 1940s and 1950s, Prima incorporated Italian folk music, jump blues, and early rock & roll into his repertoire, helping to bridge genres and generations. His collaborations with vocalist Keely Smith and saxophonist Sam Butera in the 1950s, especially during their Las Vegas residency, revitalized his career and introduced his exuberant style to new audiences.[1][4][5]

Prima's legacy is marked by his charismatic stage presence, genre-blending sound, and willingness to embrace his Sicilian heritage at a time when many ethnic musicians were discouraged from doing so. He is credited with influencing the development of swing, jump blues, and even early rock & roll, and his music continues to inspire artists across genres. In popular culture, he is perhaps best remembered as the voice of King Louie in Disney's 'The Jungle Book' (1967), further cementing his status as an enduring figure in American entertainment.[1][3]
