## Biography
Jack Owens (1904–1997) was a seminal figure in the Mississippi blues tradition, particularly known for his association with the 'Bentonia school' of blues, a style characterized by its haunting, minor-key tonality and unique guitar tunings. Born in Bentonia, Mississippi, Owens learned to play guitar as a child, inspired by family members and the local musical environment. For most of his life, he worked as a sharecropper and ran a weekend juke joint, where he performed alongside harmonica player Benjamin 'Bud' Spires. Owens was not widely recorded until the blues revival of the 1960s, when he was rediscovered by musicologist David Evans. His first major recordings, such as 'Goin’ Up the Country' (1966) and 'It Must Have Been the Devil' (1970, with Spires), brought him critical acclaim and introduced his music to a broader audience. Owens and Spires became a celebrated duo, performing at festivals in the United States and Europe, and Owens was honored with a National Heritage Fellowship in 1993.

Owens’ musical style was deeply rooted in the rural traditions of the Mississippi Delta, with a repertoire that included both traditional blues and original compositions. He often played in open D-minor tuning and was known for his powerful, unamplified voice and rhythmic guitar work. His performances, frequently held on the front porch of his farmhouse, were legendary for their authenticity and connection to the community. Owens and Spires were also featured in a Levi’s 501 Blues commercial, further cementing their status as icons of the blues revival. Owens’ legacy endures as a vital link to the early days of the blues, and his music continues to inspire new generations of musicians.
