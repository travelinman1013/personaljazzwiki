## Biography
Lafayette Harris Jr. is an acclaimed American jazz pianist, arranger, and composer, celebrated for his rhythmic vitality, harmonic depth, and elegant phrasing. Born in Philadelphia in 1963 and raised in Baltimore, Maryland, Harris began his musical journey with private lessons and playing in church, later performing in local bands that covered R&B and funk classics. His early inspiration came from Baltimore native Eubie Blake, whose performance of Scott Joplin's 'Maple Leaf Rag' motivated Harris to master the piece and deepen his commitment to jazz[1][2][7].

Harris pursued formal music education, earning a Bachelor of Music from Oberlin Conservatory and a Master’s degree in Jazz Performance from Rutgers University, where he studied with renowned pianist Kenny Barron. After moving to New York in the mid-1980s, Harris became a fixture in the city’s jazz scene, performing at iconic venues such as the Blue Note and Sweet Basil. He quickly gained a reputation as a 'go-to' pianist, leading to collaborations with jazz luminaries and a debut album, 'Lafayette Is Here,' on Muse Records in 1995. His career expanded to Broadway, where he served as associate conductor and keyboardist for 'Bring in Da Noise, Bring in Da Funk' and contributed to other productions like 'The Color Purple.'[1][2][3]

Throughout his career, Harris has worked with a wide array of artists, including Max Roach, Ernestine Anderson, Roswell Rudd, and Houston Person. His discography spans over ten albums, and his style seamlessly blends jazz, blues, stride, and gospel influences. Harris is recognized for his passionate flair, deep knowledge of jazz tradition, and his role as a mentor and educator, leaving a significant legacy in both performance and jazz education[1][3][4].
