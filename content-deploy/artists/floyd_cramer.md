## Biography
Floyd Cramer was born on October 27, 1933, in Campti, Louisiana, near Shreveport, and grew up in the small sawmill town of Huttig, Arkansas. He began playing piano by ear at age five, developing a distinctive 'slip-note' style characterized by smooth, slightly discordant slides that became a hallmark of his sound. After high school graduation in 1951, he moved to Shreveport to work as a pianist on the Louisiana Hayride radio show, backing artists like Hank Williams Sr., Webb Pierce, Jim Reeves, Lefty Frizzell, and early performances by Elvis Presley.[1][2][3]
