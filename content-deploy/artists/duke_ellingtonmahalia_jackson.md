## Biography
Duke Ellington (born Edward Kennedy Ellington in Washington, D.C., 1899) was a pioneering American composer, pianist, and bandleader whose career spanned more than five decades. He led one of the most influential jazz orchestras in history, composing thousands of pieces that helped define the big band and jazz genres. Ellington's music often transcended categories, blending jazz, blues, classical, and gospel influences to create a uniquely American sound. His career saw a resurgence in the late 1950s after the success of his Newport Jazz Festival performance, leading to a new recording contract and a series of acclaimed albums.

Mahalia Jackson, born in New Orleans in 1911, was a legendary gospel singer whose powerful contralto voice and spiritual conviction made her one of the most influential vocalists of the twentieth century. She moved to Chicago at age 20, where she became a central figure in gospel music, performing worldwide and at historic events such as the 1963 March on Washington and Martin Luther King Jr.'s funeral. Jackson's deep faith and emotive singing style brought gospel music to mainstream audiences, earning her the title "Queen of Gospel."

In 1958, Ellington and Jackson collaborated on the album "Black, Brown and Beige," a landmark recording that fused jazz and gospel traditions. The suite, originally premiered at Carnegie Hall in 1943, narrates the African-American experience through music. Jackson's rendition of "Come Sunday" on this album is considered a groundbreaking moment, as it marked one of the first major crossovers between gospel and jazz, highlighting both artists' commitment to expressing themes of struggle, hope, and faith through their music.
