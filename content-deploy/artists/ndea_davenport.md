## Biography
N'Dea Davenport, born in Atlanta, Georgia, is a celebrated American singer, songwriter, producer, and performer best known for her pivotal role in the acid jazz movement as the lead vocalist of The Brand New Heavies. Growing up as an only child to a headmaster and school counselor, Davenport immersed herself in creative pursuits, including piano, dance, sports, and theater, which laid the foundation for her dynamic artistry[4][6]. Her adventurous spirit led her to Los Angeles in the 1980s, where she became part of the vibrant underground club and warehouse scene, mingling with influential artists and musicians[4]. Her talent was quickly recognized by Delicious Vinyl, who signed her and later facilitated her introduction to The Brand New Heavies, a collaboration that would define her career and help launch the international acid jazz movement[1][4].

With The Brand New Heavies, Davenport's soulful vocals and energetic stage presence were instrumental in shaping the band's sound, blending funk, soul, and R&B into a fresh, live-instrumentation-driven style that stood out against the era's computer-driven music trends[1][7]. She contributed to four successful albums with the group before departing in 1994 to focus on her solo career, releasing her self-titled debut album in 1998, which showcased her versatility and commitment to authentic, genre-defying music[1][4]. Davenport's solo work and collaborations reflect her dedication to musical freedom, social commentary, and community, earning her a reputation as a central force in acid jazz and neo-classical soul[1][4].

Her legacy extends beyond her own recordings, as she has worked with a diverse array of artists across genres, including Madonna, Malcolm McLaren, Guru, Natalie Merchant, and Dallas Austin[1][4]. Davenport's influence is evident in the evolution of acid jazz and the resurgence of live instrumentation in contemporary R&B and soul, inspiring a new generation of musicians to embrace authenticity and creative exploration[3][4].
