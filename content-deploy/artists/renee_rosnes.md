## Biography
Renee Rosnes, born Irene Louise Rosnes on March 24, 1962, in Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada, is widely recognized as one of the premier jazz pianists, composers, and arrangers of her generation[2][7]. Raised in North Vancouver, British Columbia, she began classical piano lessons at age three and was introduced to jazz by her high school band director, Bob Rebagliati[2][4]. After studying classical performance at the University of Toronto, Rosnes received a Canada Council for the Arts grant in 1985, which enabled her to move to New York City and immerse herself in the vibrant jazz scene[2].

Rosnes quickly established herself in New York, joining the Blue Note Records band Out of the Blue and recording 'Spiral Staircase' in 1989[2]. She became a sought-after pianist, working with jazz legends such as Joe Henderson, Wayne Shorter, J.J. Johnson, James Moody, Bobby Hutcherson, and Ron Carter[1][2][3]. Rosnes was a founding member of the SFJAZZ Collective, touring with the ensemble for six years, and has served as music director for ARTEMIS, an international all-star band[1][3]. Her discography includes numerous acclaimed albums as both leader and collaborator, and she has won multiple Canadian Juno Awards, including her seventh in 2023 for 'Kinds of Love'[2].

Rosnes's musical style is noted for its conceptual depth, suspenseful compositions, and virtuosic performances, blending classical training with sophisticated jazz improvisation[3][5]. Her legacy is marked by her contributions as a performer, composer, and bandleader, as well as her influence on contemporary jazz through collaborations, mentorship, and her role in advancing ensemble work in groups like SFJAZZ Collective and ARTEMIS[1][2][3].
