## Biography
Valaida Snow (1904 or 1905-1956) was born in Chattanooga, Tennessee, into a show business family, the eldest of four children, with her mother training her and her siblings in performance arts from a young age. A child prodigy, by age five she performed as 'Valada the Great' with the family’s Pickaninny Troubadours, singing, dancing, and playing violin. By 15, she mastered cello, bass, banjo, violin, mandolin, harp, accordion, clarinet, saxophone, and trumpet, favoring the trumpet which earned her the nickname 'Little Louis' from Louis Armstrong, who called her the world's second-best jazz trumpeter.[1][3][4][6]
