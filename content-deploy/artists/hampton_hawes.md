## Biography
Hampton Barnett Hawes Jr. was born on November 13, 1928, in Los Angeles, California, into a deeply musical family. His father, Hampton Hawes Sr., was the minister of Westminster Presbyterian Church, while his mother, Gertrude Holman, served as the church pianist. Raised in this strict, religious environment, Hawes taught himself to play piano as a child by listening to records of 1930s jazz piano giants, particularly Earl 'Fatha' Hines and Fats Waller. By his teenage years, he was already performing professionally with leading West Coast jazz musicians, and at just 18 years old, he secured his second professional job playing for eight months with the Howard McGhee Quintet at the Hi De Ho Club—a group that notably included Charlie Parker shortly after Parker's release from Camarillo.[1][2][3]

Hawes became a central figure in the West Coast jazz movement during the late 1940s and early 1950s. His first recording session occurred in 1947 with Dexter Gordon and Wardell Gray, and by late 1947, his growing reputation led to consistent studio work. Between 1948 and 1952, he recorded live at prominent Los Angeles jazz venues including The Haig, The Lighthouse, and The Surf Club. After serving in the U.S. Army in Japan from 1952 to 1954, Hawes' solo career accelerated dramatically. He signed with Lester Koenig's Contemporary Records and recorded prolifically, forming a trio with bassist Red Mitchell and drummer Chuck Thompson. The landmark *All Night Session!* album, recorded in a non-stop overnight session in November 1956 with guitarist Jim Hall, established him as a major figure in modern jazz. His playing style synthesized influences from Charlie Parker and Bud Powell with cleaner articulation, Oscar Peterson phrases, and later Bill Evans techniques, while pioneering the double-note blues figures and comping style that would influence Horace Silver and others.[2][3][4]

Despite his artistic achievements, Hawes struggled with severe drug addiction throughout the 1950s. He was imprisoned for heroin possession at the height of his musical influence but was released in 1963 by order of President John F. Kennedy. He returned to recording for Contemporary and other labels in the USA, Europe, and Japan, gradually rebuilding his career over approximately five years. Throughout the 1970s, he continued recording studio and festival sessions, sometimes incorporating electric piano. Hampton Hawes died on May 22, 1977, leaving behind a legacy as a major figure in the development of modern jazz piano playing. His autobiography, *Raise Up Off Me*, won the Deems-Taylor Award for music writing in 1975.[1][2][3]

## Fun Facts
- Hawes left his high school graduation ceremony directly to perform a gig with the Big Jay McNeely band, demonstrating his commitment to music over traditional milestones.[1]
- He was released from federal prison in 1963 by direct order of President John F. Kennedy, a remarkable intervention that allowed him to resume his recording career at a critical moment.[1]
- The *All Night Session!* album was recorded during a non-stop overnight recording session on November 12, 1956, producing close to 20 tracks that were split across three albums—a remarkable feat of musical endurance and creativity.[4]
- After winning the 'New Star of the Year' award in Down Beat magazine and 'Arrival of the Year' in Metronome in 1956, Hawes' later struggles with addiction caused his significant early contributions to be somewhat overshadowed in jazz history.[3]
