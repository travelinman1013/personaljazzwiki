## Biography
Beau Williams, born January 6, 1950, in Houston, Texas, grew up as the son of a Baptist preacher and choir director, immersing him in music from an early age. As a teenager, he gained local fame under the name Bobo Mr Soul with a regional hit record in Houston and appeared regularly on a live television show. Nearly joining The Temptations after auditioning in Los Angeles, he was rejected for being only five feet eight inches tall, prompting him to form the group Solar Heat with his brothers, which signed to ABC but released no album before the label's decline.[1][2]

Williams launched his solo career in secular R&B/soul with Capitol Records in 1982, debuting with the self-titled album featuring 'If You're Ready' and a cover of Leon Russell's 'A Song For You,' which resonated with UK soul fans. Subsequent Capitol releases included 'Stay With Me' (1983) with 'You've Been' (backing vocals by The Temptations), 'Bodacious!' (1984) peaking at #56 on US R&B charts, and 'No More Tears' (1986) with tracks like 'All Because Of You.' In the late 1980s, he transitioned to gospel music, signing with Light Records for acclaimed albums like 'Wonderful' (1989), which peaked at #2 on Billboard Gospel charts, earned a Dove Award, and received Grammy and Stellar nominations, followed by 'Higher' (1990) and 'Love' (1992).[1][2]

Williams continued his gospel career with releases on A&M ('Power,' 1994), Insync ('They Need To Know,' 1996), and later independent labels, including 'Visions' (2005) and 'The Greatest Gift' (2002). His versatile style blends soulful R&B with gospel roots, marked by smooth vocals and emotive delivery. Beyond recording, he performed national anthem duties for the Los Angeles Lakers for six years and appeared on sports events for Texas Rangers, Dallas Cowboys, and Houston Rockets, as well as religious TV programs like Robert Tilton's 'Success-N-Life' and Trinity Broadcasting Network.[2]
