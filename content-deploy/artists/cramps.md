## Biography
The Cramps were an American rock band formed in 1976 when Erick Lee Purkhiser (Lux Interior) and Kristy Marlana Wallace (Poison Ivy Rorschach) decided to create a vehicle for their shared obsessions with rock music, horror films, and the occult. The couple had first met in Sacramento, California in 1972 as traditional hippies, but after discovering their mutual love for old-school novelty records, glam rock, and bands like The Stooges, they moved to New York City in 1975 just as the punk revolution was taking shape. Positioning themselves within the legendary CBGB and Max's Kansas City punk scene alongside acts like the Ramones, Patti Smith, and Blondie, they coined the term "psychobilly" to describe their unique fusion of punk rock with 1950s rockabilly, becoming progenitors of this subgenre.

The band's lineup rotated frequently throughout their existence, with only the husband-and-wife duo of Lux Interior and Poison Ivy remaining constant. Their first complete lineup in April 1976 included guitarist Bryan Gregory and drummer Pam Balam, though drummers changed twice in short succession—first Miriam Linna replaced Balam, then Nick Knox replaced Linna in September 1977. The Cramps released their debut EP "Gravest Hits" in 1979, followed by their first full-length album "Songs the Lord Taught Us" in 1980. Their sound was characterized by two distorted guitars (initially without a bass player), Lux's loud and frenzied vocals, and a deliberately raw, bluesy aesthetic enriched by references to horror B-movies, sci-fi, and exploitation films. The band relocated to Los Angeles in 1980 and continued recording over ten albums across a thirty-year career, with Poison Ivy eventually adding bass to their sound around 1985 for the album "A Date With Elvis."

The Cramps became notorious for their wild live performances featuring Lux Interior's sexually charged demeanor, scantily clad appearance, and tendency to end shows bloodied, while Poison Ivy maintained an icy detachment playing guitar at his side. Their theatrical shows revived drag culture, camp aesthetics, and 1950s sounds, influencing countless bands in the psychobilly, horror punk, and gothic rock genres. Despite achieving international success, particularly in Europe where "A Date With Elvis" became a hit in 1986, their American concerts remained largely restricted to small clubs. The band's unique career came to a sudden and tragic end when Lux Interior died of an aortic dissection in 2009, after which the band permanently disbanded.

## Fun Facts
- In June 1978, The Cramps performed a free benefit concert for patients at the California State Mental Hospital in Napa Valley, creating a legendary video that showed how incredibly ahead of their time their performance style was.
- Lux Interior took his stage name from a car advertisement, while Poison Ivy claimed to have received her name in a dream—she was originally Poison Ivy Rorschach, taking her last name from the inventor of the Rorschach inkblot test.
- The band's first major tour was as the opening act for The Police during their UK tour promoting 'Outlandos d'Amour' in the late 1970s, thanks to being signed by Miles Copeland III to I.R.S. Records.
- The Cramps initially performed without a bass player, using two distorted guitars to create their signature powerful and spooky sound, until Poison Ivy decided to add bass around 1985.
