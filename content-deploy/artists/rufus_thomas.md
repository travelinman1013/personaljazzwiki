## Biography
Rufus Thomas (March 26, 1917 – December 15, 2001) was a pioneering American rhythm-and-blues, soul, and funk singer, songwriter, dancer, DJ, and comic entertainer, born in Cayce, Mississippi and raised in Memphis, Tennessee. His early exposure to Memphis’s vibrant musical scene shaped his career, which began in the 1930s as a tap dancer and vaudeville performer touring with the Rabbit Foot Minstrels. By the 1940s, Thomas had become a prominent figure on Beale Street, hosting amateur contests that helped launch the careers of future legends like B.B. King[4][5].

Thomas first gained national attention in 1953 with his Sun Records single "Bear Cat," an answer to Big Mama Thornton’s "Hound Dog," which became a major R&B hit. However, his most enduring legacy was forged at Stax Records, where he and his daughter Carla Thomas recorded "’Cause I Love You," the label’s first hit. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Thomas became known for his infectious dance records such as "Walking the Dog," "Do the Funky Chicken," and "(Do the) Push and Pull," which blended R&B, soul, and funk with his trademark humor and energetic stage presence. His career spanned over six decades, and he remained active as a performer and recording artist into the 1990s, earning the nickname "The World’s Oldest Teenager"[2][3][4].

Thomas’s influence on Memphis music was profound; he was a mentor to many local musicians and a key ambassador for the city’s sound. His playful, groove-driven style and charismatic performances helped define the Memphis soul aesthetic, and his work at WDIA radio and on Beale Street made him a central figure in the city’s musical community. He was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 2001 and is remembered as one of the most beloved and enduring personalities in American popular music[3][4][5].
