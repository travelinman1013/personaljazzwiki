## Biography
Stevie Nicks, born May 26, 1948 in Phoenix, Arizona, is an American singer-songwriter renowned for her distinctive voice, poetic lyrics, and mystical stage persona. Raised in a musical family, Nicks began singing at a young age and formed her first band, Fritz, in high school, performing alongside future collaborator Lindsey Buckingham. After recording the album 'Buckingham Nicks' as a duo, the pair joined Fleetwood Mac in 1975, catalyzing the band's transformation into one of the most successful acts in rock history. Their first album together, 'Fleetwood Mac' (1975), and the follow-up, 'Rumours' (1977), became massive commercial and critical successes, with 'Rumours' selling over 21 million copies in the US alone and winning the Grammy Award for Album of the Year.

Nicks launched her solo career in 1981 with the album 'Bella Donna,' which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and produced enduring hits such as 'Edge of Seventeen' and 'Stop Draggin’ My Heart Around.' Throughout the 1980s and beyond, she balanced her solo work with ongoing contributions to Fleetwood Mac, releasing a string of platinum albums and touring extensively. Nicks is celebrated for her ethereal songwriting, blending rock, pop, and folk influences, and for her influence on generations of artists. She is the first woman to be inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame twice: with Fleetwood Mac in 1998 and as a solo artist in 2019.

Nicks’s legacy is marked by her resilience through personal and professional challenges, including struggles with addiction and tumultuous relationships within Fleetwood Mac. Her enduring appeal lies in her ability to channel vulnerability and strength into her music, making her a revered figure in rock and pop culture.
