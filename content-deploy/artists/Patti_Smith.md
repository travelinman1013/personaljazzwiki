## Biography
Patti Smith, born Patricia Lee Smith on December 30, 1946, in Chicago, Illinois, is an American singer, songwriter, poet, and artist who became a seminal figure in the New York City punk rock movement. Raised in New Jersey after her family moved from Chicago and Philadelphia, Smith was exposed to music and literature from a young age, developing a fascination with artists and poets such as Arthur Rimbaud and Bob Dylan. After high school, she briefly attended college and worked in a factory before moving to New York City in 1967, where she immersed herself in the city's vibrant countercultural scene.

Smith began her career performing spoken word poetry, often blending it with music, and soon formed the Patti Smith Group in 1974. Their debut album, 'Horses' (1975), produced by John Cale, fused raw punk energy with poetic lyricism and became a landmark release, establishing Smith as a pioneering force in proto-punk and alternative music. Her most commercially successful single, 'Because the Night,' co-written with Bruce Springsteen, appeared on the 1978 album 'Easter.' Smith's work is characterized by its fusion of rock and poetry, challenging gender norms and expanding the possibilities for women in rock music.

After a period of semi-retirement in the 1980s, during which she lived in Michigan with her husband, Fred 'Sonic' Smith of MC5, she returned to music following his death in 1994. Smith has since continued to record, perform, and publish acclaimed books, including her National Book Award-winning memoir 'Just Kids.' Her influence on punk, alternative rock, and feminist artistry is profound, earning her induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and recognition as one of Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.
