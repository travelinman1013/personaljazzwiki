## Biography
Dolly Parton, Linda Ronstadt, and Emmylou Harris—collectively known as the 'Trio'—are three of the most celebrated voices in American music, each with a distinct background in country, folk, and pop. Their collaboration began in the 1970s, but it was not until 1987 that they were able to release their first full album together, aptly titled 'Trio.' The album, produced by George Massenburg, showcased their remarkable vocal harmonies and deep mutual respect, blending traditional country, folk, and pop influences into a sound that was both timeless and innovative[1][4][5].

The roots of their partnership trace back to a shared admiration: when Harris and Ronstadt met in the early 1970s, they discovered they were both fans of Dolly Parton, and Parton reciprocated their respect[4]. Despite early recording sessions in the late 1970s, contractual obligations and busy solo careers delayed a full release. Some of these early collaborations surfaced on their solo albums, but it was not until the mid-1980s that they could fully realize their vision. 'Trio' became a multi-platinum success, winning multiple Grammy Awards and revitalizing interest in harmony-driven, roots-based music[1][2][4].

The 'Trio' project is widely credited with helping to spark a revival of traditional American music and female collaboration in country and folk genres. Their seamless harmonies, song selection, and willingness to share the spotlight set a new standard for supergroup collaborations. The legacy of their work together endures, influencing generations of vocalists and musicians across genres[3][4][6].
