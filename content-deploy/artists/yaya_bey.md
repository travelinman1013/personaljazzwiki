## Biography
Hidaiyah 'Yaya' Bey is an American R&B musician born August 4, 1990, in Queens, New York. She is the daughter of hip-hop artist Grand Daddy I.U., who served as her primary parent and nurtured her artistic development from an early age. Around age nine, Bey developed a passion for writing songs and poems, laying the foundation for her multidisciplinary creative practice. At age 18, she relocated to Washington, D.C., which she describes as her second home, where the city's cultural landscape—including museums, libraries, poetry communities, and protest movements—further ignited her artistic creativity and social consciousness.

Bey's professional music career began with her debut album 'The Many Alter-Egos of Trill'eta Brown' in 2016, which incorporated digital collage and an accompanying book, earning praise from publications including FADER and Essence. She followed with critically acclaimed projects including 'This Too...' (2019), 'Madison Tapes' (2020), and 'The Things I Can't Take With Me' EP (2021)—the latter being the first release on Big Dada's relaunch as a label dedicated to Black, POC, and minority ethnic artists. Her 2022 album 'Remember Your North Star' received 'Best New Music' recognition from Pitchfork and showcased her fusion of soul, jazz, reggae, afrobeat, and hip-hop. Her subsequent albums 'Ten Fold' (2024) and 'do it afraid' (2025) further solidified her reputation as one of R&B's most compelling storytellers.

Beyond music, Yaya Bey is a multidisciplinary artist, poet, art curator, and activist. She has created cover artwork for her own projects through intimate photo collages and self-portraits, completed residencies at Brooklyn's Museum of Contemporary African Diasporan Arts (MoCADA), and served as an art curator for the PG African American Museum. She founded Sanaa, a mutual aid organization, and has worked as a street medic at protests. Her artistic practice consistently centers the Black woman's experience while maintaining a commitment to authenticity, relatability, and social consciousness. As a self-identified working-class artist, she maintains a healthy distrust of institutions and has demonstrated her independence by self-funding album recordings.
