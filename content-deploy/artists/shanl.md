## Biography
Channelle Lekogo, known professionally as Shan'L, was born on February 6, 1989, in Libreville, Gabon, specifically originating from the Haut-Ogooué province. She developed her passion for music early, joining the school choir Les Anges ABC at Lycée National Léon Mba, where she served as lead vocalist and choreographer through her secondary studies until obtaining her baccalauréat. In 2011, she gained initial visibility by reaching the finale of the Miss Gabon beauty contest, during which her performance of 'Joyeux anniversaire' caught the attention of Cameroonian producer Edgard Yonkeu, who signed her to Direct Prod label.[2][4][5]

Shan'L debuted professionally in 2013 with the zouk single 'L'aveu' in collaboration with Gabonese singer Arielle T, followed by features with artists like Tina, J-Rio, and F.A.N.G. Her career breakthrough came in 2015 when she won Airtel Trace Music Star in Gabon and competed as one of 13 national finalists in the pan-African finale in Kenya, mentored by Akon. She released her debut album Shan’l Is My Name that year and her second album Eklektik 2.0 in 2020, featuring hits like 'Tchizambengue,' 'Yayayobé,' 'Okokè,' and 'Où est le mariage' with Fally Ipupa. In 2020, she was a finalist in the pan-African Prix Découvertes RFI, winning the public vote but placing second.[2][3]

Shan'L's musical style blends RnB, Afropop, zouk, and contemporary R&B with soul, funk, pop, and African elements, characterized by smooth melodies, catchy beats, and relatable lyrics on love and life. Signed to Sony Music Entertainment Côte d'Ivoire since around 2020 and Keyzit in 2024, she has earned accolades including the 2018 PRIMUD award for Best Central African Artist and an AFRIMMA nomination. Her Spotify presence highlights genres like coupé-décalé, ndombolo, rap ivoire, bikutsi, and rumba congolaise, reflecting her regional influences and popularity score of 33.[2][3]
