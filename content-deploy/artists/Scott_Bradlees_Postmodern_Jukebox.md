## Biography
Scott Bradlee's Postmodern Jukebox (PMJ) is a rotating musical collective founded in 2011 by New York-based pianist and arranger Scott Bradlee. Bradlee, who struggled for years as a jazz musician in New York City, began experimenting with reimagining modern pop songs in vintage styles, such as swing, jazz, and ragtime. His early YouTube videos, including a ragtime medley of 1980s songs and 'A Motown Tribute to Nickelback,' gained viral traction and encouraged him to pursue this concept further[1][3].

PMJ started as a small group of Bradlee's friends recording videos in his basement apartment in Astoria, Queens. The original lineup included bassist Chris Anderson, saxophonist Ben Golder-Novick, harpist Brandee Younger, and vocalist Emma Walker. As the project grew, Bradlee's entrepreneurial approach—testing video formats, optimizing for virality, and recruiting a rotating cast of musicians—transformed PMJ into a global phenomenon. The group has since featured over 70 performers, toured six continents, and amassed billions of YouTube views[1][3].

PMJ is celebrated for its innovative reinterpretations of contemporary hits, blending genres from the 1920s to the 1960s. Their arrangements often feature brass, woodwinds, and vintage vocal stylings, breathing new life into songs by artists like Radiohead, Lady Gaga, and Taylor Swift. The collective's legacy lies in its ability to showcase both established and emerging talent, launching the careers of many vocalists and musicians while reviving interest in classic jazz and swing aesthetics[2][3].

## Fun Facts
