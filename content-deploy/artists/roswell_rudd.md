## Biography
Roswell Hopkins Rudd Jr. (1935–2017) was an American jazz trombonist and composer renowned for his pioneering work in free and avant-garde jazz. Born in Sharon, Connecticut, Rudd was raised in a musically inclined family; his father was a sometime drummer who hosted jam sessions at home, and Rudd began his musical journey with the mellophone and French horn before teaching himself trombone. Early exposure to Dixieland and traditional jazz, including live performances by Louis Armstrong, deeply influenced his formative years. Rudd attended Yale University, where he played in the trad jazz band Eli's Chosen Six, but soon after graduation, he gravitated toward New York's avant-garde jazz scene.

Throughout the 1960s, Rudd became a leading trombone voice in the burgeoning free jazz movement, collaborating with innovative musicians such as Cecil Taylor, Archie Shepp, and John Tchicai (with whom he co-founded the New York Art Quartet). His robust, expressive playing style bridged the collective improvisation of early jazz with the spontaneous creativity of the avant-garde. Rudd's career spanned collaborations with Carla Bley, Steve Lacy, Charlie Haden, and international projects, including groundbreaking cross-cultural work with Malian musicians. He was also a dedicated musicologist and educator, teaching at Bard College and the University of Maine, and his influence extended across generations of jazz trombonists. Rudd's legacy is marked by his adventurous spirit, technical mastery, and commitment to musical dialogue across genres and cultures.
