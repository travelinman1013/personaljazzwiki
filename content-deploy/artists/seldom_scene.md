## Biography
The Seldom Scene is a pioneering bluegrass band formed in 1971 in Bethesda, Maryland, by a group of accomplished musicians who initially gathered simply to play music for fun. The original lineup consisted of John Starling (guitar), Mike Auldridge (dobro), Ben Eldridge (banjo), Tom Gray (bass), and John Duffey (mandolin), all of whom were already active in the Washington, D.C. bluegrass scene. Their blend of traditional bluegrass with innovative arrangements and covers of songs from outside the genre quickly set them apart, helping to expand the boundaries of bluegrass and attract a broader, often urban, audience[1][2][3].

The Seldom Scene became known for their weekly performances at the Red Fox Inn and later the Birchmere Music Hall, where their inventive approach and musicianship drew both fans and critical acclaim. Despite numerous lineup changes over the decades, the band's commitment to blending old and new material—ranging from bluegrass standards to reinterpretations of artists like Merle Haggard and James Taylor—has remained a hallmark of their style. Their influence is widely credited with helping to usher in the 'newgrass' movement, and their discography includes landmark albums such as 'Act I,' 'Act II,' and 'Old Train.' The band has received multiple Grammy nominations and is celebrated for its longevity and impact on American roots music[2][3][8].

Today, The Seldom Scene continues to perform and record, with a lineup that has evolved but still reflects the band’s original spirit of musical exploration and camaraderie. Their legacy endures as both innovators and ambassadors for bluegrass, inspiring generations of musicians and fans alike[3][8].

## Fun Facts
- The band's name originated as a joke from Charlie Waller of the Country Gentlemen, who doubted the group would perform often and asked, 'What are you going to call yourselves, the seldom seen?'[1]
- Most of the original members had full-time, non-musical careers—ranging from medicine to mathematics—when the band started, making their bluegrass success even more remarkable[2].
- The Seldom Scene was instrumental in popularizing bluegrass among urban audiences, helping to dispel stereotypes about the genre[2].
- They have been nominated for multiple Grammy Awards and have appeared on national television programs such as 'Entertainment Tonight' and 'Nightline'[2].
