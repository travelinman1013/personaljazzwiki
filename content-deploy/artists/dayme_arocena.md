## Biography
Daymé Arocena, born in Havana, Cuba in January 1992, is widely recognized as one of the most exciting voices in contemporary Latin and Afro-Cuban music. A musical prodigy from a young age, she began performing semi-professionally at eight and became the lead singer of the acclaimed Afro-Cuban big band Los Primos at fourteen. Her rigorous classical training at the Amadeo Roldán Conservatory, where she studied choir conduction, provided her with a foundation in both Western classical and Cuban musical traditions, including jazz, cha-cha-chá, salsa, and bolero, as well as influences from composers like Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninoff[2][4][5][6].

Arocena's international breakthrough came as a co-founder and vocalist for the Cuban-Canadian jazz collective Maqueque, led by Jane Bunnett, with whom she won the 2015 Juno Award for Best Jazz Album. Her solo career launched with the critically acclaimed album "Nueva Era" in 2015, earning her a spot on NPR's list of 50 favorite albums and comparisons to legendary singers Celia Cruz and Aretha Franklin. Over subsequent albums, including "Cubafonía," "Sonocardiogram," and "Alkemi" (2024), she has continually reinvented her sound, fusing Afro-Caribbean rhythms, jazz, neo-soul, R&B, and pop, while maintaining a strong connection to her African heritage and Santería faith[1][2][3][4][5][6].

Forced into exile from Cuba due to political persecution, Arocena has lived in Canada and Puerto Rico, where she recorded her latest album with producer Eduardo Cabra of Calle 13. Her genre-defying style and powerful stage presence have made her a beacon for Black and female artists in Latin music, challenging conventions and inspiring a new generation of musicians. Her legacy is marked by her innovative blending of tradition and modernity, and her commitment to representing Afro-Cuban culture on the global stage[1][4][5][6].
