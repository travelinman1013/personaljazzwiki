## Biography
Otis Lee Jackson Jr., known professionally as Madlib, was born on October 24, 1973, in Oxnard, California, into a musically rich family; his father Otis Jackson Sr. was a soul musician, his mother Dora Sinesca Jackson a songwriter, and his uncle the jazz trumpeter Jon Faddis. Surrounded by records from a young age, he sampled his first song at 11 using his father's collection and began producing beats in the early 1990s at his Oxnard-based Crate Diggas Palace studio. He formed the hip-hop collective Lootpack with high school friends DJ Romes and Wildchild (Jack Brown), releasing their EP *Psyche Move* in 1995, which led to a deal with Stones Throw Records; their debut album *Soundpieces: Da Antidote* (1999) marked his rise, blending underground hip-hop with jazz, funk, and soul influences.[1][2][3]

Madlib's career exploded in the 2000s with his alter ego Quasimoto's acclaimed debut *The Unseen* (2000), featuring his pitched-up rapping, and innovative projects like the fictional jazz quintet Yesterdays New Quintet (2001), where he played all instruments and used alter egos such as Monk Hughes and Ahmad Miller to explore jazz-hip-hop fusion. Key collaborations defined his style, including Jaylib with J Dilla (*Champion Sound*, 2003), Madvillain with MF Doom (*Madvillainy*, 2004)—a hip-hop landmark—and later MadGibbs with Freddie Gibbs. His sample-heavy, eclectic production drew from global sources like Bollywood, African, and South American records, earning him titles like Complex's Best Hip-Hop Producer of 2019; he launched Madlib Invazion in 2010 for the expansive *Madlib Medicine Show* series spanning hip-hop, jazz, and beats.[1][3][5]

Madlib's legacy as one of hip-hop's most influential producers lies in his prolific output under dozens of aliases (e.g., Beat Konducta, Lord Quas), raw dusty vinyl sound, and boundary-pushing genre blends like plunderphonics and experimental hip-hop. Staying true to underground roots, his work with artists like Talib Kweli (*Liberation*), Erykah Badu, and Percee P (*Perseverance*) continues to inspire, with ongoing releases cementing his status as a multi-instrumentalist innovator.[1][2][3]

## Fun Facts

- He raps under his Quasimoto alias using a pitched-up voice to disguise his natural tone, debuting on the critically acclaimed *The Unseen* (2000), named one of *Spin*'s top 20 albums of the year.
