## Biography
Mohammed Ismail Sherif Kwaku Frimpong, known professionally as Black Sherif, is a Ghanaian singer, rapper, and songwriter born on January 9, 2002, in Konongo-Zongo, Ashanti Region, Ghana. Raised by extended family while his parents were often abroad, Black Sherif’s upbringing blended traditional Ghanaian values with contemporary global influences. He attended Konongo Zongo Islamic Basic School and later Kumasi Academy, where his passion for music and dance began to flourish. Black Sherif started his music career in 2019, releasing his debut single 'Money' in May 2020, but it was his 2021 tracks 'First Sermon' and 'Second Sermon' that brought him widespread recognition. The latter, especially its remix featuring Burna Boy, catapulted him to continental fame. His 2022 hit 'Kwaku the Traveller' became a global sensation, topping charts in Ghana and Nigeria and earning him the distinction of being the first Ghanaian to top the Nigerian Apple Music chart. Black Sherif’s debut album, 'The Villain I Never Was,' released in October 2022, further solidified his reputation for blending highlife, hip-hop, reggae, and UK drill influences, with lyrics often delivered in Twi and English that reflect personal experiences and youth aspirations.

Black Sherif’s musical style is a rich fusion of asakaa, Ghanaian hip hop, hiplife, afrobeats, afrobeat, afropop, afro adura, and afropiano, marked by introspective storytelling and genre experimentation. His authenticity and dynamic stage presence have earned him accolades such as Artist of the Year and Most Popular Song of the Year at the Vodafone Ghana Music Awards 2023, and Performer of the Year at the 3Music Awards 2024. He has performed at major international festivals, including the Wireless Festival in the UK, becoming the first Ghanaian artist to do so. Black Sherif’s journey from the streets of Konongo-Zongo to international acclaim is a testament to his passion, resilience, and unique voice, positioning him as a leading figure in contemporary African music.
