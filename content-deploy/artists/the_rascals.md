## Biography
The Rascals, originally known as the Young Rascals, are an American rock band formed in Garfield, New Jersey in 1965. The founding members—Felix Cavaliere (vocals, keyboards), Eddie Brigati (vocals, percussion), Dino Danelli (drums), and Gene Cornish (guitar, vocals)—were all seasoned musicians who had played in various bands before coming together. Cavaliere, classically trained in piano, and Brigati had both spent time with Joey Dee and the Starliters, a group famous for the hit 'Peppermint Twist.' Their early sound was rooted in R&B and soul, and they quickly became a sensation in the New York club scene, known for their energetic performances and soulful covers.[1][3][5]

Managed by Sid Bernstein, who was instrumental in bringing the Beatles to the United States, the Rascals signed with Atlantic Records and released their debut album, 'The Young Rascals,' in 1966. Their breakthrough came with the single 'Good Lovin’,' which soared to number one on the Billboard Hot 100. The band became known for their blend of blue-eyed soul, rock, and pop, and for hits like 'Groovin’,' 'People Got to Be Free,' and 'A Beautiful Morning.' Their music, characterized by Cavaliere’s soulful vocals and organ, Brigati’s harmonies, and Danelli’s jazz-influenced drumming, helped define the sound of late 1960s American rock.[1][3][2]

The Rascals’ influence extended well beyond their chart success. They were one of the first white groups to authentically embrace and popularize soul and R&B for mainstream audiences, earning respect from both peers and critics. After their initial run, members pursued solo projects and new bands, but their legacy as pioneers of blue-eyed soul and their impact on American pop and rock music remains significant.[3][1]

## Fun Facts
- The Rascals were originally called the Young Rascals because there was already a group called the Harmonica Rascals; they later dropped 'Young' as they became more famous.[1][3]
- Paul McCartney was so impressed by the Rascals’ live show in London in 1966 that he attended two nights in a row.[1][2]
- The band did not have an official bass player; Felix Cavaliere played bass lines on his organ pedals, and session musicians sometimes filled in for recordings.[1]
- Their hit 'Good Lovin’' was originally a cover of a song by The Olympics, but the Rascals’ version became a number one hit and their signature song.[1][3]
