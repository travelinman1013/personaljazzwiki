## Biography
Bas Clas (pronounced 'bahs clahs') is a rock band formed in Lafayette, Louisiana in the late 1970s by brothers Donnie and Steve Picou. The band's name, a Cajun term meaning 'low class,' was chosen as a tongue-in-cheek commentary on social prejudice and reflects their irreverent attitude. Initially, Bas Clas started as a rock group without a bass player but soon solidified their lineup with the addition of Geoff Thistlethwaite (bass) and Ted Cobena (drums).

Throughout the late 1970s and 1980s, Bas Clas became known for their energetic performances and original songwriting, releasing several singles on their self-created labels, Toe Up Records and Serfdom Records. Their music, rooted in rock with Southern and Cajun influences, garnered regional attention and college radio airplay across more than two dozen states. Despite interest from major producers like John Hammond Sr. and Tom Werman, the band struggled to secure a major label deal, which limited their national exposure. After relocating to Atlanta and continuing to perform and record, the band eventually reduced their activity, culminating in a final full-time performance at the 1991 New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival. Bas Clas later reunited and continues to perform and record, with releases such as 'Volume One: The Early Years 1977-86' and 'Big Oak Tree.'

The legacy of Bas Clas lies in their perseverance and unique blend of regional sounds with classic rock sensibilities. Their story is emblematic of many independent bands who, despite industry setbacks, maintained a devoted following and left a lasting mark on their local music scene.
