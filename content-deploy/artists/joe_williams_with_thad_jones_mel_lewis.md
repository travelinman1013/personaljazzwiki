## Biography
Joe Williams was a renowned American jazz vocalist celebrated for his rich baritone voice and swing-infused style, though 'JOE WILLIAMS WITH THAD JONES, MEL LEWIS' specifically refers to his prominent guest vocal role with the Thad Jones/Mel Lewis Jazz Orchestra, a seminal big band formed in New York in 1966 by trumpeter Thad Jones and drummer Mel Lewis[1][2]. This collaboration produced the landmark 1966 album *Presenting Joe Williams and Thad Jones/Mel Lewis, the Jazz Orchestra*, where Williams fronted the orchestra's innovative arrangements blending big band swing, bebop, and hard bop, backed by key players like saxophonists Jerome Richardson, Jerry Dodgion, and Joe Farrell, pianist Roland Hanna, bassist Richard Davis, and guitarist Sam Herman[2]. The orchestra itself revolutionized big band jazz during an era when the format was declining, incorporating loose small-group drumming from Lewis and sophisticated charts from Jones, while maintaining a Monday-night residency at the Village Vanguard that continues today as the Vanguard Jazz Orchestra[1][3].

Williams' career with the orchestra exemplified his versatility, having risen to fame earlier with the Count Basie Orchestra in the 1950s, where hits like 'Every Day I Have the Blues' defined his smooth, authoritative delivery[1][2]. His appearance with Thad Jones/Mel Lewis marked a high point in fusing vocal jazz with progressive big band sounds, influencing the band's reputation as one of the most impactful ensembles since the swing era[1][3]. Though not a permanent member—listed alongside guests like Dee Dee Bridgewater and Ruth Brown—Williams' session captured the orchestra's powerful, intellectual energy at its inception[1].

The Thad Jones/Mel Lewis Orchestra's legacy endures through Grammy wins for *Live in Munich* (1978) and *Monday Night Live at the Village Vanguard* (2009), with Jones' arrangements shaping composers like Maria Schneider and Bob Brookmeyer[1]. Williams' broader impact as a jazz icon persisted until his death in 1999, but this collaboration highlighted his enduring appeal in big band contexts amid the band's evolution after Jones' 1978 departure to Copenhagen and Lewis' passing in 1990[1][3].
