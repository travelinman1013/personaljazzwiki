## Biography
Maribou State & Holly Walker refers to the long‑running creative partnership between English electronic duo Maribou State (Chris Davids and Liam Ivory) and London-based singer‑songwriter and writer Holly Walker. Maribou State formed in Hertfordshire, England, where Davids and Ivory met at school, played in local bands, and began producing together in a home studio before debuting as Maribou State in 2011 with the EP *Habitat* on FatCat Records.[2][5] Their early work blended downtempo, house, and experimental electronica, and they quickly became known for richly textured productions and atmospheric sampling, leading to releases on Southern Fried Records and remixes for artists such as Fatboy Slim, Lana Del Rey, Kelis, and others.[2] Holly Walker, meanwhile, developed as a vocalist, songwriter, and performer in London, working behind the scenes in the industry and honing a literate, soulful writing style before becoming a recurring collaborator and live performer with the duo.[1][6]

Walker first appeared on Maribou State’s 2013 *Truths* EP, one of several vocalists featured as the duo pushed toward more song‑based material.[2] The partnership deepened on Maribou State’s debut album *Portraits* (2015), where Walker’s vocal performance on “Midas” became one of their signature tracks and later earned BPI Silver certification in 2022.[2] On their acclaimed second album *Kingdoms in Colour* (2018), she contributed vocals and co-writing to tracks including “Steal” and “Tongue,” becoming a central voice in the Maribou State sound alongside other collaborators such as Khruangbin and North Downs.[2][7] Their music together is characterised by warm, organic‑sounding electronics, chopped and re‑pitched vocal textures, and a balance of club‑ready rhythm with introspective, narrative‑driven lyricism; Ninja Tune has described Maribou State’s approach as giving electronic music “a much-needed shot of soul.”[7] The collaboration has continued into the next phase of their careers, including the single “Otherside” (2024) and material around Maribou State’s third studio album *Hallucinating Love* (2025), while Walker has simultaneously launched a solo career with her own releases such as the album *Unsung*, extending the songwriting sensibility that first drew attention through her work with the duo.[1][2][4]

The Maribou State & Holly Walker partnership has had a notable live dimension: Walker has performed as a featured vocalist in Maribou State’s live band at major international shows and festivals, helping translate their studio intricacy into full‑band performances that blend electronics with live instrumentation.[2][7] Their joint work has been widely supported by BBC Radio 1 and BBC 6 Music DJs including Annie Mac, Nick Grimshaw, Gilles Peterson, Lauren Laverne, and Pete Tong, and *Kingdoms in Colour* reached the UK Top 40 and #4 on the UK Record Store chart, cementing their status within left‑field electronic and indie circles.[2] As Maribou State continue to evolve their sound and Walker steps further into the spotlight as a solo artist, their collaborations stand as a key bridge between UK electronic production and sophisticated singer‑songwriter craft, influencing how producers and vocalists approach long‑term, album‑spanning partnerships in contemporary electronic music.[1][2][7]

## Fun Facts
- Chris Davids and Liam Ivory first played together when Liam asked Chris to join his band on bass; when they both moved north for university, the band faded and the pair converted a bedroom into a home studio, which became the birthplace of Maribou State.[5]
- Maribou State’s 2018 album *Kingdoms in Colour* includes the track “Turnmills,” named after a now‑closed London nightclub; the song functions as both a tribute to the club and a broader reflection on the changing landscape of London nightlife.[2]
- The track “Midas,” featuring Holly Walker, has become one of Maribou State’s best‑known songs and was certified Silver by the BPI in 2022, marking a major commercial milestone for their collaboration.[2]
- Before stepping out with her own solo album *Unsung*, Holly Walker spent years as a behind‑the‑scenes writer and vocalist, with her work with Maribou State effectively serving as the public introduction to her distinct blend of incisive lyricism and soulful delivery.[1][6]
