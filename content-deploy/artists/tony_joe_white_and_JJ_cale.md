## Biography
Tony Joe White (July 23, 1943 – October 24, 2018), known as the 'Swamp Fox,' was an American singer-songwriter and guitarist celebrated for pioneering the swamp rock genre. Born the youngest of seven children on a cotton farm near Oak Grove, Louisiana, White was deeply influenced by the Southern landscape and culture, which permeated his music. He began performing at school dances and nightclubs in Texas and Louisiana before signing with Monument Records in 1967. His 1969 debut album, 'Black and White,' featured the hit 'Polk Salad Annie,' a song that became a U.S. Top 10 hit and was later covered by Elvis Presley and Tom Jones. White's songwriting prowess extended to penning 'Rainy Night in Georgia,' which became a classic through Brook Benton's rendition in 1970.

Throughout the 1970s and beyond, White's career was marked by collaborations with major artists and a unique blend of blues, rock, country, and soul. He toured with acts like Steppenwolf and Creedence Clearwater Revival, contributed to Jerry Lee Lewis's landmark 'Southern Roots' sessions, and wrote hits for Tina Turner, including 'Steamy Windows' and 'Undercover Agent for the Blues.' His distinctive sound, characterized by a laid-back groove and gritty storytelling, earned him a cult following in Europe and the U.S. White continued recording and performing into the 2010s, with his later works produced by his son Jody White, maintaining his signature swampy style until his passing in 2018.

J.J. Cale (December 5, 1938 – July 26, 2013), though not a direct collaborator with White, shared a parallel legacy as a foundational figure in American roots music. Born in Oklahoma, Cale developed the 'Tulsa Sound,' a laid-back, understated blend of blues, country, and rock. Like White, Cale's influence far exceeded his commercial fame, shaping the work of artists such as Eric Clapton and Mark Knopfler. Both artists are frequently cited together for their relaxed, groove-oriented approach and enduring impact on blues rock.
