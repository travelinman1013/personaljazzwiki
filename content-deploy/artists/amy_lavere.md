## Biography
Amy LaVere, born Amy LaVere Fant, is an American singer, songwriter, upright bass player, and actress based in Memphis, Tennessee.[1] Born in Shreveport, Louisiana, LaVere grew up in a musically rich household nurtured by parents with a passion for traditional country music.[1][5] Her childhood was marked by frequent relocations—her family moved 13 times by the time she entered high school, eventually settling in Detroit where she formed her first band, the alt-rock group Last Minute, while still in her teens.[1] This peripatetic upbringing exposed her to diverse musical traditions and instilled in her a deep appreciation for roots music that would define her artistic identity.

LaVere's professional career began in earnest during the early 1990s in Nashville, where she became part of the Lower Broadway scene as half of the popular roots duo The Gabe & Amy Show, during which she began playing upright bass.[1][4] In 1999, she relocated to Memphis and began working at the legendary Sun Studio, immersing herself in the city's vibrant music community.[1][4] Her debut solo album, *This World Is Not My Home*, released in 2006 on the indie label Archer Records, garnered instant national acclaim and featured collaborations with accomplished artists including bluesman Jimbo Mathus of the Squirrel Nut Zippers.[1][2] Her breakthrough came with her second album, *Anchors and Anvils* (2007), produced by Jim Dickinson, which rose to number six on the Americana Music Charts and earned her a nomination for the Americana Music Association Awards' Best New Or Emerging Artist.[1][3]

Throughout her career, LaVere has established herself as a distinctive voice in Americana and indie-folk circles, known for her barbed, introspective lyrics and unique soprano voice.[3] Her discography includes seven studio albums: *This World Is Not My Home* (2006), *Anchors and Anvils* (2007), *Stranger Me* (2011)—called "the break-up album of the year" by Spin—*Runaway's Diary* (2014), and *Painting Blue* (2019), the latter produced by her husband Will Sexton.[1][3] Beyond her solo work, LaVere has participated in notable collaborations including the all-star bluegrass quintet The Wandering (2012) with Luther Dickinson, Valerie June, Shannon McNally, and Sharde Thomas, and the project Motel Mirrors with John Paul Keith and Shawn Zorn (2013).[1] She has been honored as "Best Singer in Memphis" on three separate occasions and has performed at prestigious venues and festivals ranging from the Royal Albert Hall in London to Bonnaroo and the Beale Street Music Festival.[1][3]

## Fun Facts
- LaVere made a cameo appearance as rockabilly queen Wanda Jackson in the 2005 film Walk the Line and had a featured role in Craig Brewer's 2006 film Black Snake Moan, demonstrating her versatility beyond music.[1]
- She opened for Seasick Steve at the prestigious Royal Albert Hall in London on October 1, 2008, marking a significant international performance milestone early in her career.[1]
- Memphis's music culture profoundly shaped her artistic philosophy; LaVere has stated that "Memphis doesn't allow you to be trite. It not only forces you to be original, it's an accepting and supportive place for that which may seem unusual anyplace else."[5]
- Her album Stranger Me (2011) was critically acclaimed as "the break-up album of the year" by Spin magazine, establishing her reputation for emotionally raw and introspective songwriting.[3]
