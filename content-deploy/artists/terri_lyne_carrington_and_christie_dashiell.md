## Biography
Terri Lyne Carrington & Christie Dashiell is a collaborative project between two accomplished jazz musicians. Terri Lyne Carrington is a four-time Grammy Award-winning drummer, composer, producer, and NEA Jazz Master who has celebrated 40 years in music and is recognized as one of the finest jazz drummers and producers of her generation.[1][3][5] Christie Dashiell is a Grammy-nominated vocalist, singer, composer, and educator who was born and raised in Washington, DC and North Carolina.[4] Together, they released *We Insist 2025!* in 2025, a powerful reimagining of Max Roach's groundbreaking 1960 protest album *We Insist! Max Roach's Freedom Now Suite*.[1][3]

The *We Insist 2025!* project represents a contemporary artistic statement on social justice and resistance. Carrington conceived the album as a tribute to Max Roach's pioneering work while expanding its sonic palette to blend jazz with gospel, neo-soul, funk, Afro-Latin, West African, and blues traditions.[3] Dashiell's involvement brings a Grammy-nominated vocal presence that reflects on the original work's history with a contemporary call to action, honoring the masterpiece while furthering the fight for social justice.[2] The album was recorded in September 2024 and released through Candid Records, the same imprint that originally released Roach's groundbreaking work.[1]

The ensemble for *We Insist 2025!* reflects a cosmopolitan and inclusive vision, featuring an intergender, interracial, international, and intergenerational band that includes Ghanaian percussionist Weedie Braimah, Dominican Spanish trumpeter Milena Casado, French vibraphonist Simon Moullier, Canadian-born guitarist Matthew Stevens, and a special guest appearance by Julian Priester, the only living musician from the original 1960 recording.[1][3] Carrington's artistic philosophy emphasizes that joy can be an important form of resistance to oppression, and the album captures both the spirit of resistance and acknowledges joy as a form of protest.[3]

## Fun Facts
- The We Insist 2025! project was originally conceived as a five-drummer project to salute Max Roach's 100th birthday, but Carrington jettisoned this idea in favor of releasing her own interpretation for practical reasons of time and personnel management.[1]
- Carrington recorded We Insist 2025! in September 2024 while 'cautiously hopeful' that Kamala Harris would win the presidential election and become the first woman, first Black female, and first Middle East Asian-descended U.S. president—the album was released months after Trump's election victory.[1]
- The Social Science ensemble, which Carrington co-founded with pianist Aaron Parks and guitarist Matthew Stevens, germinated in the aftermath of the 2016 U.S. presidential election and produced the protest album Waiting Game, which captured the Black Lives Matter and #MeToo movements as well as the plight of Native Americans and the LGBTQ community.[1]
- Christie Dashiell had not deeply studied the original We Insist! album before collaborating with Carrington, though she was already familiar with it—she describes being more familiar with Miles Davis' Kind Of Blue or Marvin Gaye's What's Going On.[1]
