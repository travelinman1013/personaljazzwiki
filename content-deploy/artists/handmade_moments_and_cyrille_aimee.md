## Biography
Cyrille Aimée is a French jazz vocalist born on August 10, 1984, in Samois-sur-Seine, France, to a French father and Dominican mother. She grew up in a multilingual household immersed in Afro-Caribbean rhythms from her mother's native Dominican Republic and the vibrant gypsy jazz traditions of her hometown, which hosted the annual Django Reinhardt Festival. As a teenager, she would sneak out of her bedroom window at night to mingle with gypsy musicians performing at the festival, igniting a lifelong passion for jazz and inspiring her vision of a global community united in musical creativity and spontaneity.

Aimée pursued formal training at the American School of Modern Music in Paris before relocating to the United States to earn a jazz degree at SUNY Purchase in New York. During her college years, she became a regular performer at iconic New York jazz venues including Birdland Jazz Club, Joe's Pub, and Smalls Jazz Club in Greenwich Village. Her breakthrough came with victories at major international competitions: the Montreux Jazz Festival Competition in 2007, finalist status at the Thelonious Monk International Jazz Competition in 2010, and the Sarah Vaughan International Jazz Vocal Competition in 2012. Her debut album, *Cyrille Aimée & the Surreal Band* (2008), immediately showcased her winsome charm, supple voice, and stylistic diversity, incorporating swing, French and Latin influences, and folk and pop elements.

Throughout her career, Aimée has established herself as an internationally renowned vocalist celebrated for her bold improvisation and magnetic stage presence. Her critically acclaimed albums with Mack Avenue Records, including *Move On* featuring Stephen Sondheim compositions, earned a Grammy nomination. Her latest album, *À Fleur de Peau* (Whirlwind Recordings), co-produced with Jake Sherman, showcases her unique blend of jazz, pop, and Caribbean rhythms. Currently based in Brooklyn and later New Orleans, she continues to perform regularly in Manhattan's historic jazz clubs and has collaborated with jazz legends including Roy Hargrove, Wynton Marsalis, Emmett Cohen, and the New Orleans Jazz Orchestra.
