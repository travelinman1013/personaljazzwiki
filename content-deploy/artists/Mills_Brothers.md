## Biography
The Mills Brothers were an American vocal quartet from Piqua, Ohio, consisting of brothers John Jr., Herbert, Harry, and Donald Mills. Born into a musical family—their father was a barber and sang in a barbershop quartet, while their mother was also a singer—the brothers began harmonizing as children, performing in church choirs and on street corners, and learning much of their craft from their parents[1][3]. Their early exposure to music and close-knit harmonies laid the foundation for their signature sound, which blended jazz, pop, gospel, and rhythm and blues[2]. The group’s big break came in 1930 when they were signed to a three-year contract with CBS radio, making them the first African Americans to host a network radio show and helping them cross racial barriers to achieve widespread popularity among both Black and white audiences[1]. Over a career spanning more than 50 years, the Mills Brothers recorded over 2,000 songs, sold more than 50 million records, and placed over 50 singles in the Top 40, with their 1943 hit “Paper Doll” spending twelve weeks at No. 1 and selling six million copies[1][2][3]. Their innovative use of vocal harmonies and their ability to imitate instruments with their voices—creating the illusion of a full band—set them apart and influenced the development of doo-wop and later vocal groups[1][2]. Despite personal tragedies, including the death of John Jr. in 1936 (after which their father, John Sr., joined the group), the Mills Brothers continued to perform internationally, completing 37 world tours and becoming the first Black artists to give a command performance before British royalty in 1934[3][4]. Their legacy endures as pioneers who broke racial barriers and shaped the sound of American popular music.

## Fun Facts
- The Mills Brothers were the first African-American artists to give a command performance before British royalty, performing for King George V and Queen Mary in 1934[3][4].
- They pioneered the technique of vocal instrument imitation, using their voices to mimic trumpets, trombones, and other instruments, creating the illusion of a full band without any instruments on stage[1][3].
- After the death of John Jr. in 1936, their father, John Sr., joined the group, making them one of the few family acts to include a parent replacing a child[1][4].
- They completed 37 world tours over their career, a remarkable feat for any group of their era[3].
