## Biography
Billie Holiday, born Eleanora Fagan on April 7, 1915, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, emerged from a challenging childhood in Baltimore to become one of the most influential jazz and swing singers of the 20th century[1][5]. Raised primarily by her mother, Holiday faced poverty, instability, and time in reform school before moving to New York City in her teens. There, she began singing in Harlem nightclubs, drawing inspiration from blues and jazz legends like Bessie Smith and Louis Armstrong[4][5].

Holiday’s career took off in the early 1930s when she was discovered by producer John Hammond and recorded with Benny Goodman and Teddy Wilson, quickly gaining recognition for her unique phrasing and emotive delivery[1][3]. She became known as 'Lady Day,' a nickname given by saxophonist Lester Young, with whom she shared a close musical partnership. Holiday broke barriers as the first African American woman to perform with an all-white orchestra, led by Artie Shaw, and recorded enduring classics such as 'God Bless the Child' and the haunting protest song 'Strange Fruit,' which addressed racial violence in America[2][4].

Despite her artistic triumphs, Holiday’s life was marked by personal struggles, including substance abuse and legal troubles. Her autobiography, 'Lady Sings the Blues,' and her final album, 'Lady in Satin,' cemented her legacy as a deeply expressive artist whose work influenced generations. Holiday died of heart failure on July 17, 1959, at age 44, but her impact endures through numerous posthumous honors, including induction into the Grammy and Rock & Roll Halls of Fame[1][5].
