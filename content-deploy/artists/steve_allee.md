## Biography
Steve Allee, born September 14, 1950, in Indianapolis, Indiana, is an American jazz pianist, composer, arranger, and educator whose career has been deeply rooted in the Indianapolis jazz scene since the 1960s[1][7]. Allee’s musical journey began in his school band, where he initially played trombone before his band director encouraged him to learn piano—a decision that would shape his future. Within two years, he was studying with Indianapolis jazz legend Claude Sifferlen, whom he credits as his mentor[2]. Despite a brief stint at Indiana University’s School of Music, Allee chose to focus on performing, quickly establishing himself as a professional musician by touring with the Buddy Rich Orchestra as a teenager[1][5].

Over the decades, Allee has become a central figure in Indianapolis jazz, known for his versatility as a performer, composer, and arranger. He has released several albums as a leader, including the Grammy-nominated big band album Downtown Blues and more recent projects like Naptown Sound, which pays homage to the city’s rich jazz heritage[1][6]. His musical style is firmly grounded in the straight-ahead jazz tradition, often infused with the distinctive “Naptown Sound” associated with Indianapolis legends such as Wes Montgomery and Freddie Hubbard[6][8]. Beyond performing, Allee has composed for film and television, served as music director for the nationally syndicated Bob and Tom Show, and held teaching positions at the University of Cincinnati and Indiana University[1][3]. His legacy is that of a bridge between generations, preserving and advancing the Indianapolis jazz tradition while mentoring new musicians.
