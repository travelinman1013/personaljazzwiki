## Biography
Clara Moreno, born March 13, 1971, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, is a celebrated vocalist whose artistry is deeply rooted in the rich traditions of bossa nova, samba, and Brazilian jazz. The daughter of renowned Brazilian musicians Joyce Moreno and Nelson Angelo, Clara was immersed in music from an early age, often accompanying her mother to rehearsals and concerts. Her earliest musical experiences included singing backing vocals in children’s choirs for legendary artists such as Milton Nascimento, Egberto Gismonti, and Originais do Samba, which laid the foundation for her future career.

At 18, Clara moved to France to study music, where she began performing solo at esteemed venues like the Lionel Hampton Jazz Club in Paris and recorded her first single. Returning to Brazil in 1994, she quickly established herself as a solo artist, debuting with a tribute to Rita Lee and releasing her self-titled album in 1996. Over the years, Clara has explored a range of Brazilian genres, from traditional samba to contemporary bossa nova, and has been recognized for her ability to blend classic influences with modern sensibilities. Her albums, such as 'Morena Bossa Nova' and 'Meu Samba Torto,' showcase her innovative approach, often paying homage to her musical heritage while pushing the boundaries of Brazilian music for new audiences.

Clara Moreno's legacy is defined by her commitment to honoring and revitalizing the sounds of her native Rio de Janeiro. Her work has garnered critical acclaim internationally, particularly in the UK and Japan, and she is celebrated for her vibrant interpretations and collaborations with leading figures in Brazilian music. As both a torchbearer and innovator, Clara continues to inspire listeners with her authentic yet contemporary voice in Brazilian popular music.
