## Biography
Walter "Bunny" Sigler (March 27, 1941 – October 6, 2017) was a pivotal figure in the development of the Philly soul sound, renowned as a singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and producer. Born and raised in Philadelphia, Sigler earned his nickname 'Bunny' as a child, both for his prominent front tooth and because he was born near Easter. He began his musical journey singing in church and performing with local doo-wop groups such as The Opals, which included his brother James Sigler. By the late 1950s, he was performing in local venues and recording for V-Tone Records, and his emotionally charged performance style soon made him a teen idol in Philadelphia.[1][4][6]

Sigler's breakthrough came in 1967 with his medley "Let the Good Times Roll & Feel So Good," which reached #20 on the R&B charts and #22 on the pop charts. This success led to further recordings with Cameo-Parkway, but when the label folded, Sigler transitioned to working with Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff, the architects of the Philadelphia International label. He became an integral part of the Philly soul movement, not only as a solo artist but also as a Grammy-nominated songwriter and producer for acts like The O'Jays, Patti LaBelle, Instant Funk, and Shirley Jones. Sigler's style blended gospel roots, emotional delivery, and sophisticated soul arrangements, helping to define the lush, orchestrated sound of Philadelphia soul throughout the 1970s and beyond.[1][2][4]

Later in his career, Sigler returned to his gospel roots, releasing spiritual projects that reflected his lifelong faith. His legacy endures through his influential songwriting, collaborations, and the countless artists who have drawn inspiration from his work. Bunny Sigler passed away in 2017 in his hometown of Philadelphia, leaving behind a rich catalog and a lasting impact on American soul and R&B music.[1][2][3]
