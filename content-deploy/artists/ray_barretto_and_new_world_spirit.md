## Biography
Ray Barretto, born Raymond Barretto Pagan on April 29, 1929, in Brooklyn, New York, to Puerto Rican parents, grew up in the Bronx and Spanish Harlem. At 17, he joined the U.S. Army in 1946, where he was stationed in Germany and discovered his passion for music after hearing Dizzy Gillespie's 'Manteca' featuring Chano Pozo, inspiring him to pursue percussion despite facing racial discrimination.[1][4] Returning to New York, he became a sought-after conga player, working with jazz luminaries and replacing Mongo Santamaria in Tito Puente's band in the late 1950s, contributing to albums like Dance Mania.[2][8]

Barretto launched his career as a leader in 1961 with Riverside Records, capitalizing on the pachanga craze, and scored a pop hit in 1963 with 'El Watusi' via his Charanga La Moderna group on Tico Records.[1][2] He joined Fania Records in 1967, recording influential boogaloo and salsa albums like Acid (1968) and Que Viva La Música (1973), blending Latin rhythms with jazz and R&B elements, though he later grew dissatisfied with salsa's direction.[1][3][5] In 1990, he won a Grammy for Ritmo en el Corazón with Celia Cruz and Adalberto Santiago, marking his shift toward Latin jazz.[1]

In 1992, Barretto formed the New World Spirit jazz sextet, focusing on Afro-Cuban jazz fusions for Concord Picante, releasing albums like Handprints (1991), Ancestral Messages, and Taboo (1993-1994), and leading it until his death on February 17, 2006.[1][2][3][7] His legacy includes pioneering Latin jazz percussion, induction into the International Latin Music Hall of Fame (1999), and the NEA Jazz Masters Award (2006).[1]
