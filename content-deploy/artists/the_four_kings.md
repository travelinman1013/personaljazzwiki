## Biography
The Four Kings, also known as The Uniques, were a doo-wop vocal group originating from the Linden area, likely in New Jersey based on their association with Linden Junior High. The group was formed by songwriter Sam Stray, who began writing songs in 1953, with his debut composition 'She's My Baby (Yes She Is).' They emerged in the mid-1950s doo-wop scene, characterized by harmonious vocals and rhythm & blues influences typical of the era, aligning with genres like doo-wop and northern soul as noted in modern platforms.[4][6]

Little is documented about their career development, but they recorded under multiple names including The Four Kings and The Uniques, fitting into the East Coast doo-wop tradition of groups from New Jersey and nearby regions. No major hits or national chart success are recorded, consistent with many obscure acts prized by collectors. Their style reflected the standard doo-wop sound of the 1950s, with group harmonies on original songs penned by Stray.[4][6]

Their legacy remains niche, remembered primarily in doo-wop enthusiast circles through blogs and collector sites, with low modern popularity (Spotify rating of 1). They represent the vast number of local vocal groups that contributed to the genre's rich but often uncharted history without achieving widespread fame.[4][6]
