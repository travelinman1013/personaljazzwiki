## Biography
Benjamin Koppel, Scott Colley, and Brian Blade form the KCB Collective, a chordless jazz trio that has been active since 2012. The group first came together in Copenhagen, performing at Koppel's Summer Jazz festival, and quickly established a reputation for their democratic interplay and lyrical improvisation[1][2]. Danish alto saxophonist Benjamin Koppel, known for his versatile and highly expressive style, leads the trio, while American bassist Scott Colley and drummer Brian Blade bring melodic sensibilities and inventive rhythmic approaches that set them apart from conventional rhythm sections[2][6].

Koppel, a prolific artist with over 60 albums to his name, has collaborated with many jazz luminaries and classical soloists, earning numerous awards and honors, including being named Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres by France in 2011[3]. Colley and Blade, both respected figures in the jazz world, have extensive discographies and have played with icons such as Wayne Shorter and John Scofield[8]. The trio's music is characterized by a 'less is more' philosophy, emphasizing spare textures, deep emotional resonance, and collective improvisation. Their albums, including 'Perspective' and their work on 'Mulberry Street Symphony,' showcase their ability to blend individual artistry into a cohesive, emotionally charged whole[7][9].

The legacy of the KCB Collective lies in their innovative approach to trio performance, eschewing harmonic instruments in favor of pure melodic and rhythmic interplay. Their work is celebrated for its humanitarian themes, technical mastery, and the palpable sense of connection among the musicians, making them influential figures in contemporary jazz[5][7].
