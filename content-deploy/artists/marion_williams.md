## Biography
Marion Williams was born on August 29, 1927, in a Miami ghetto, Florida, to a West Indian butcher father from the Bahamas and a South Carolina laundry woman mother, both deeply religious. Her love for gospel music began in childhood, influenced by church singing, her brother's blues and jazz records, and neighborhood calypso, alongside inspirations like the Smith Jubilee Singers, Kings of Harmony, Mary Johnson Davis, and especially Sister Rosetta Tharpe. After her father's death at age nine and quitting school at 14 to work in a laundry—later solely supporting her mother after she lost both legs to diabetes—Williams sang in church and on street corners, gaining recognition as Miami's top gospel soloist by 1946.[2][4][5]

## Fun Facts
- Earned the nickname 'Miss Personality' for her sparkling enthusiasm and interactive performances with the Clara Ward Singers, where she would sashay into the audience, sit on listeners' laps, and simulate packing their goods during 'Packin’ Up,' often causing frenzied ecstasy.
- Suffered 'nervous spells' from the intense energy of her high-note performances, leading her to yell to release remaining vocal power.
- First gospel singer to receive the Kennedy Center Honors in 1993 and a MacArthur 'genius grant' that same year.
- Impersonated a guitar on 'The New Gospel Train' and recorded unconventional tracks like Bob Dylan's 'Wicked Messenger' and a Hare Krishna song.
