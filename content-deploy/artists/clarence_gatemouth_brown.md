## Biography
Clarence "Gatemouth" Brown (April 18, 1924 – September 10, 2005) was an American musician renowned for his mastery of multiple instruments and his refusal to be confined by genre. Born in Vinton, Louisiana, and raised in Orange, Texas, Brown was taught guitar and fiddle by his father, a local musician who exposed him to country, Cajun, bluegrass, and polka. By age five, Brown was already playing the fiddle, and by his teenage years, he was performing on guitar and drums, earning the nickname "Gatemouth" for his deep voice.

Brown's career began in earnest after World War II, when he moved to Houston and famously stepped in for T-Bone Walker at the Bronze Peacock nightclub in 1947, launching into his own composition, "Gatemouth Boogie." This performance led to a recording contract and a string of influential singles, including "Okie Dokie Stomp" and "Ain't That Dandy." Throughout his career, Brown blended blues, jazz, country, Cajun, and R&B, becoming a pioneer of genre fusion and a virtuoso on guitar, fiddle, mandolin, harmonica, and more. He toured widely, led large orchestras, and hosted the Dallas R&B TV show "The !!!! Beat" in 1966. Brown's legacy includes a Grammy Award, multiple W.C. Handy Awards, and induction into the Blues Hall of Fame. He is remembered as a trailblazer whose eclectic style influenced generations of musicians and expanded the boundaries of American roots music.
