## Biography
John 'Papa' Gros is a celebrated New Orleans keyboardist, singer, and songwriter whose music embodies the vibrant spirit of the Crescent City. Born and raised in New Orleans, Gros began playing gigs at just fifteen and honed his craft further after graduating from Loyola University in 1989 with a degree in French Horn performance. Immersed in the city’s musical traditions, he quickly became a sought-after sideman, performing with legendary local musicians and absorbing the deep grooves and rhythms that define New Orleans music.

In the early 1990s, Gros launched his solo career, gaining recognition from icons such as George Porter Jr. and Snooks Eaglin, who brought him on as a supporting musician. His solo debut, 'Day’s End,' arrived in 2004, but his most prominent role came as the leader of Papa Grows Funk, a band he formed in 2000. For over a decade, Papa Grows Funk held a legendary weekly residency at the Maple Leaf Bar, releasing six acclaimed albums and touring internationally. After the group disbanded in 2013, Gros returned to solo work, releasing 'River’s On Fire' in 2016 and 'Central City' in 2020, the latter serving as a love letter to New Orleans and its musical heritage.

Gros’s style is a gumbo of New Orleans funk, rock, jazz, blues, and Americana, drawing on the city’s rich musical lineage while forging his own path. His live performances are renowned for their infectious energy and eclecticism, and he is recognized as a torchbearer of the New Orleans tradition, blending reverence for the past with a forward-looking approach that continues to inspire musicians and audiences alike.
