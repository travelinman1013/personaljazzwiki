## Biography
Edward Wiley Ray, better known as Eddie Ray, was born on December 21, 1926, in Franklin, a small town in the Great Smoky Mountains of Western North Carolina. Growing up in a rural setting, he was immersed in country and bluegrass music, listening to radio stations like WBT, WSB, and WSM, including the Grand Ole Opry. After high school in 1944, he briefly served in the Army but was discharged due to vision issues and moved to Milwaukee in 1945, starting his music career as a stock boy at a Decca Records distribution warehouse. This entry-level role sparked a lifelong journey in the industry, where he quickly learned operations and advanced through roles in shipping, sales, promotion, and distribution at companies like Aladdin Records and Central Record Sales in Los Angeles.[1][2][7]

Ray's career exploded in the 1950s as National Director of Promotion and Sales at Imperial Records, championing artists like Fats Domino, Ricky Nelson, Slim Whitman, and others, while producing hits such as Sandy Nelson's 'Let There Be Drums' and Ernie Freeman's 'Raunchy.' In 1964, he broke barriers as the first African American Vice President of A&R at Capitol Records, signing acts like Freddie & The Dreamers, Harry Nilsson, and securing Pink Floyd for the label. His songwriting peaked with 'Hearts of Stone' in 1954, co-written with Rudy Jackson, which topped R&B, pop, and country charts for The Jewels, Fontane Sisters, The Charms, and Red Foley. In the 1970s, he became executive vice president at Sounds of Memphis and founded a music vocational school later integrated into the University of Memphis. In 1981, President Ronald Reagan appointed him Commissioner of the U.S. Copyright Royalty Tribunal, serving eight years.[1][2][6]

Ray's multifaceted style blended promotion, production, A&R, songwriting, and education, often crossing genres from R&B and rock to country. After government service, he returned to North Carolina to revitalize the North Carolina Music Hall of Fame with Mike Curb, serving as Operation Director and Vice Chairman, and was inducted himself. As a pioneering Black executive who disregarded industry norms, his legacy endures as a North Carolina music icon who shaped careers and institutions.[1][2][4]
