## Biography
Jeff Chaz is an American blues guitarist, singer, and songwriter widely known in New Orleans as the “Bourbon Street Bluesman.” Born in Lake Charles and raised in the tiny community of Creole in Cameron Parish, Louisiana, he grew up in a household filled with his father’s big‑band and Dixieland records, including Count Basie, Glenn Miller, Duke Ellington, Benny Goodman, Louis Armstrong, and Jack Teagarden.[1][4][5] As a child he first performed at age five, doing an Elvis Presley impersonation with a plastic guitar at school, and in grade school he aspired to be a jazz trombonist before switching to trumpet and later returning to trombone in high school bands.[1][2][3] His family moved to California during his school years, where he played in orchestra but spent most of his time gigging at Latin and soul weddings and dances, setting the stage for a life as a working musician.[2][3]

After high school, Chaz hit the road on trombone with a Black Boston soul band that toured the United States, and when the group’s guitarist‑singer quit, he was pushed to the front as vocalist and coached until he sounded like a Memphis soul singer.[2][3] Still searching for his niche, he went back to California, returned to guitar, and studied music at San Bernardino College; attempts to play country music convinced him that his true voice lay in the blues, leading him to commit fully to blues guitar.[1][2] Seeking to learn from the source, he moved to Memphis for about a decade, playing in small Black blues clubs, singing gospel, and performing “Amazing Grace” at the opening of the National Civil Rights Museum; there he won the first Beale Street Blues Award and performed with or toured alongside legends such as Albert King, Little Milton, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Cab Calloway.[1][2][4] In 1996 he relocated to New Orleans at the encouragement of music attorney Ellis Pailet, quickly became a star attraction on Bourbon Street after club owner John Wehner “made a spot” for him, and built a powerful live reputation that led to recordings such as *Sounds Like the Blues to Me* and *This Silence Is Killing Me*, showcasing his fusion of Memphis blues and soul with horn‑driven arrangements and big‑band‑influenced guitar phrasing.[1][2][5][7]

Chaz’s musical style is steeped in Southern blues and soul but colored by his big‑band and jazz upbringing: he often describes his sound as Memphis blues and soul combined, strongly influenced by classic Stax Records and artists like B.B. King, Albert King, and Little Milton.[1][5] His early trombone heroes, notably Tommy Dorsey and Jack Teagarden, shaped his phrasing, leading him to play guitar lines that he likens to horn improvisations, with a blues feeling but non‑typical blues guitar contours.[1] This blend of horn‑like melodic sense, gritty vocal delivery molded in soul bands, and a deep grounding in Louisiana and Memphis traditions has made him a distinctive figure on the New Orleans scene, where, even after his Bourbon Street heyday, he continues to perform regularly and to have his music broadcast on outlets such as SiriusXM Bluesville and radio stations worldwide.[4][5][6]

## Fun Facts
- Chaz’s first public performance came at about age five, when he did an Elvis Presley impression with a plastic guitar at school; his teacher was so impressed that she took him from classroom to classroom to perform his “Elvis thing.”[2][3]
- Although best known as a guitarist, Chaz originally focused on trombone and trumpet, playing first‑chair trumpet in junior high and later gigging on trombone in Latin and soul wedding bands before fully committing to guitar and blues.[1][2][3]
- He once tried to make it as a country guitarist but described the style as being “like Chinese” to him and one of the biggest musical challenges he had ever faced, a struggle that helped push him decisively toward blues guitar.[1][2]
- Chaz sang “Amazing Grace” at the opening of the National Civil Rights Museum in Memphis and won the very first Beale Street Blues Award, underscoring how deeply he was embraced by the city’s blues community.[1][2]
