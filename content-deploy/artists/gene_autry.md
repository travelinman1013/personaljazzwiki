## Biography
Orvon Gene Autry, born on September 29, 1907, near Tioga, Texas, to Delbert and Elnora Ozmont Autry, grew up on tenant farms and later homesteads in Oklahoma, including Achille and Ravia. As a teenager, he worked for the St. Louis and San Francisco Railway as a baggage hauler and telegrapher, receiving free telegraphy lessons in exchange. While singing and playing guitar late one night at a Chelsea, Oklahoma station, he was heard by humorist Will Rogers, who encouraged him to pursue performing. In 1928, Autry joined KVOO Radio in Tulsa as 'Oklahoma's Yodeling Cowboy,' co-writing his first hit 'That Silver Haired Daddy of Mine' in 1929, which became the first million-selling gold record.[1][2][3]

Autry's career exploded in the 1930s with his Hollywood debut in 1934's 'In Old Santa Fe' alongside Ken Maynard, leading to 93 musical Western films by 1953, often featuring his horse Champion, establishing him as the 'Singing Cowboy' and 'America's Favorite Cowboy.' He signed with Republic Pictures, starred in radio's 'National Barn Dance' and 'Melody Ranch,' and released 635 recordings, including hits like 'Back in the Saddle Again,' 'Tumbling Tumbleweeds,' 'Here Comes Santa Claus,' 'You Are My Sunshine,' and 'Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,' which sold over 25 million copies. Serving as a flight officer in the Army Air Corps during World War II, he later transitioned to television with 'The Gene Autry Show' (1950-1955) and produced series like 'Annie Oakley.'[2][3][4][5]

Post-retirement in 1960 to Melody Ranch, Autry built Autry Enterprises, managing real estate, oil, media, theaters, recording firms, the California Angels baseball team, and the Gene Autry Western Heritage Museum. He earned five stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for radio, records, film, TV, and live performance, dying on October 2, 1998, in Studio City, California, from lymphoma.[1][3][4][5]
