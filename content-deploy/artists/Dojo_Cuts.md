## Biography
Dojo Cuts is a retro soul and funk band formed in Sydney, Australia in late 2008. Quickly establishing themselves as one of the country's premier heavy funk outfits, the group is known for their crisp, tight instrumentals and the powerhouse vocals of Roxie Ray, whose delivery channels both power and grit reminiscent of classic soul divas. Drawing inspiration from the sounds of the 1960s and 70s, Dojo Cuts blend vintage soul with modern funk sensibilities, creating a timeless and infectious sound that has resonated with audiences both in Australia and internationally.

The band’s debut, self-titled album was released in 2009 on the Italian label Record Kicks, earning critical acclaim and airplay worldwide. Their follow-up album, 'Take From Me' (2012), further cemented their reputation, with tracks like their cover of Stevie Wonder’s “Uptight” and original compositions such as “Say What You Mean” and “The 1-2-3’s” gaining particular attention. Dojo Cuts’ music is characterized by a dynamic rhythm section, harmonious horn arrangements, and a commitment to the authentic soul and funk tradition, while still sounding fresh and contemporary. After a period of relative quiet, the band returned in 2023 with new material, reaffirming their status as a leading force in the Australian soul scene.

Dojo Cuts’ legacy is marked by their role in revitalizing the Australian funk and soul movement, following in the footsteps of groups like The Bamboos and Cookin’ On 3 Burners. Their energetic live performances and studio recordings have made them a staple of the genre, and their influence continues to be felt among a new generation of soul musicians.
