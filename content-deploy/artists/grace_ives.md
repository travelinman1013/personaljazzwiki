## Biography
Grace Ives is a singer-songwriter and producer from New York City, known for her energetic, lo-fi synth-pop sound and confessional lyricism. Raised in a creative household by parents involved in music and film, Ives began experimenting with music at a young age, even forming a short-lived childhood band with Greta Kline (Frankie Cosmos)[1]. She attended the Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA), earning a degree in graphic design, and briefly studied poetry at SUNY Purchase before fully committing to music[1][3].

Ives released her debut EP 'Really Hot' in 2016, followed by her first full-length album '2nd' in 2019, which established her as a distinctive voice in indie pop with its catchy, minimalist production and candid songwriting[3]. Her 2022 album 'Janky Star' further showcased her blend of blunt honesty and playful pop sensibility, exploring themes like sobriety, mental health, and modern relationships[1][4]. Ives' music is characterized by its stripped-down arrangements, quirky melodies, and a DIY ethos, drawing comparisons to both 1980s twee-pop and contemporary pop icons[5].

Despite her rising profile, Ives maintains a grounded, self-deprecating persona, often addressing her anxieties about performance and the pressures of artistic perfectionism[2][4]. Her work resonates with listeners for its vulnerability and relatability, positioning her as a unique figure in the current indie pop landscape.
