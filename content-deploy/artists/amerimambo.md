## Biography
Amerimambo is a Latin jazz and dance music project known for its energetic interpretations of classic mambo, cha-cha-cha, and tango repertoire. The group specializes in creating vibrant, rhythmically driven arrangements that pay homage to the golden era of Latin ballroom music, with a particular focus on the styles popularized in mid-20th-century Cuba and the United States. Amerimambo's recordings, such as their renditions of 'Que Rico El Mambo' and 'Mambo #8,' are frequently featured in ballroom dance compilations and have been used in film soundtracks, including the 2021 movie 'The Survivor.'[2][5]

While Amerimambo is not widely recognized as a touring band or a collective with a public-facing lineup, their studio recordings have become staples in the international dance community, especially for tango, mambo, and cha-cha-cha events. Their music is characterized by crisp brass sections, lively percussion, and a faithful adherence to the traditional forms of Latin dance music, making them a favorite among dance instructors and social dance clubs. The project appears to be a studio ensemble, likely involving session musicians with backgrounds in Latin jazz and ballroom music, rather than a single individual or a regularly performing group.[3][5][8]

Amerimambo's legacy lies in their contribution to the preservation and accessibility of classic Latin dance music for contemporary audiences. By producing high-quality, danceable tracks tailored for ballroom and social dance settings, they have helped sustain interest in mambo and related genres, ensuring that these vibrant musical traditions continue to inspire dancers and listeners worldwide.
