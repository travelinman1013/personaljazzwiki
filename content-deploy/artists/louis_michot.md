## Biography
Louis Michot is a prominent Cajun and Creole musician, best known as the fiddle player and lead singer for the Grammy Award-winning Lost Bayou Ramblers. Born in Baton Rouge, Louisiana in 1979 and raised in Lafayette, Michot grew up in a deeply musical family; his father and uncles formed the traditional Cajun band Les Frères Michot, which immersed him in Louisiana French music from an early age. He began performing professionally as a teenager, first playing stand-up bass with Les Frères Michot at age 14 before picking up the fiddle at 19 and co-founding Lost Bayou Ramblers with his brother Andre in 1999. 

Michot’s musical style is rooted in Cajun and Creole traditions, but he is known for his progressive and inventive approach, blending traditional Louisiana French music with punk, rock, and experimental elements. He has been a driving force in keeping the French language and local folklore alive through music, often singing exclusively in Cajun French despite English being his first language. Beyond his work with Lost Bayou Ramblers, Michot has led projects such as Michot’s Melody Makers and Soul Creole, and in 2023 released his debut solo album 'Rêve du Troubadour.' He is also the founder of Nouveau Electric Records, a label dedicated to promoting experimental and traditional Louisiana music.

Michot’s legacy extends beyond performance; he is recognized for his cultural stewardship and environmental activism, notably incorporating solar technology into his music operations and supporting hurricane relief efforts in Louisiana. His innovative spirit and commitment to tradition have made him a central figure in the evolution and preservation of Louisiana’s musical heritage.
