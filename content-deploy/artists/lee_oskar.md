## Biography
Lee Oskar, born Lee Oskar Levitin on March 24, 1948, in Copenhagen, Denmark, is an internationally acclaimed harmonica virtuoso, composer, and producer. He began playing harmonica at age six after receiving one from a family friend, growing up in a neighborhood where harmonicas were common and developing a deep appreciation for music through Danish radio. Ray Charles, especially the 'Crying Time' album, was a formative influence during his youth. At 18, Oskar moved to New York with little more than his harmonica, busking on the streets before making his way to Los Angeles via Toronto and San Francisco.[1][4][5]

Oskar's career took off when he met Eric Burdon, former lead singer of The Animals, in Los Angeles. Together, they formed the core of the band War, whose innovative blend of rock, funk, jazz, and Latin influences was defined in part by Oskar's expressive harmonica playing. War achieved international fame with hits like 'Spill the Wine,' 'Low Rider,' 'The Cisco Kid,' and 'Why Can’t We Be Friends?,' with Oskar's harmonica a signature element of their sound. He remained a member of War for 24 years, later performing with original members as the LowRider Band. Alongside his band work, Oskar launched a successful solo career, earning accolades such as the 1976 Triple Crown for Instrumental Artist of the Year from Billboard, Cashbox, and Record World.[1][2][3][4]

Beyond performing, Oskar is a respected harmonica manufacturer. Frustrated by the quality of available instruments, he founded Lee Oskar Harmonicas in 1983, partnering with Tombo Musical Instrument Company in Japan to produce high-quality, modular harmonicas. His designs are widely used by musicians across genres, cementing his legacy not only as a performer but also as an innovator in musical instrument design.[3][5]
