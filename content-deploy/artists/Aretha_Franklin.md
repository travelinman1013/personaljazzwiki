## Biography
Aretha Louise Franklin was born on March 25, 1942, in Memphis, Tennessee, to Reverend C. L. Franklin, a renowned Baptist preacher and civil rights activist, and Barbara Siggers Franklin, a gospel singer. After her parents separated, Aretha moved with her father and siblings to Detroit, Michigan, where she was raised in a musically rich environment surrounded by gospel greats like [[Mahalia_Jackson]] and Clara Ward. Her mother died when Aretha was ten, and she found solace in music, singing solos at her father's New Bethel Baptist Church and learning piano by ear. By age 14, she had recorded her first gospel album, 'Songs of Faith,' and began touring with her father's gospel caravan, gaining early exposure to professional musicianship and performance.[1][2][3][4]

In her late teens, inspired by the crossover success of Sam Cooke, Franklin set her sights on a secular music career. She declined an offer from Motown and instead signed with Columbia Records in 1960, where she recorded jazz, pop, and blues material, but it was not until her move to Atlantic Records in 1967 that she found her signature sound. With hits like 'Respect,' '(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman,' and 'Chain of Fools,' Franklin became the undisputed 'Queen of Soul,' blending gospel fervor with R&B, pop, and blues. Her powerful voice, emotional depth, and piano skills set new standards for vocal artistry and helped define the sound of American soul music in the late 1960s and 1970s.[1][3][4]

Franklin’s influence extended far beyond her chart-topping records. She was the first woman inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987 and won 18 Grammy Awards over her career. Her music became intertwined with the civil rights movement, and her artistry inspired generations of singers across genres. Franklin’s legacy is marked by her innovative vocal phrasing, her ability to infuse songs with deep emotion, and her role as a cultural icon who broke barriers for women and African American artists in popular music.[3][1]
