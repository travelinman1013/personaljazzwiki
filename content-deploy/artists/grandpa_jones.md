## Biography
Grandpa Jones, born Louis Marshall Jones on October 20, 1913, in Niagara, Kentucky, was the youngest of ten children in a musically inclined family. His father played fiddle and his mother sang ballads, which fostered his early interest in music. By his teenage years, Jones was already performing on radio shows, and his cranky demeanor during early morning broadcasts earned him the nickname 'Grandpa,' a persona he embraced and developed throughout his career[4][2].

Jones's career took off in the 1930s and 1940s as he mastered the banjo, particularly the clawhammer style taught to him by Cousin Emmy. He became a regular on the WLS Barn Dance in Chicago and later joined the Grand Ole Opry in 1946, where he remained a beloved fixture for over fifty years. His energetic banjo playing, yodeling, and humorous performances made him a standout in the country and bluegrass scenes. Jones also became a national television personality as a charter cast member of 'Hee Haw' in 1968, where his comedic routines and musical segments, often with his wife Ramona Riggins, endeared him to a broad audience[1][3].

Grandpa Jones's legacy is marked by his contributions to classic country, bluegrass, and gospel music. He wrote and popularized songs such as 'Eight More Miles to Louisville,' 'Mountain Dew,' and 'T for Texas.' Inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1978, Jones is remembered as one of country music's most beloved figures, whose influence extended to generations of musicians. He continued performing until his death on February 19, 1998, in Hermitage, Tennessee[1][2].
