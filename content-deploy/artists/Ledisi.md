## Biography
Ledisi Anibade Young, born March 28, 1972, in New Orleans, Louisiana, is a Grammy Award-winning singer, songwriter, music producer, author, and actress. Raised in a musical family—her mother Nyra Dynese and father Larry Sanders were both accomplished soul and R&B vocalists—Ledisi began composing songs at age four and took opera lessons as a child, later moving to Oakland, California, after her parents’ separation. Her early musical education included gospel choir leadership in high school and opera and piano studies at UC Berkeley, which laid the foundation for her distinctive blend of soul, jazz, gospel, and R&B[1][2][3].

Ledisi’s professional career began in the 1990s when she formed the funk band Anibade, quickly becoming a fixture in the Bay Area club scene. After struggling to secure a major label deal, she co-founded LeSun Records with Sundra Manning, releasing her debut album 'Soulsinger: The Revival' in 2000. The album’s grassroots success led to further independent releases and eventually a major-label contract with Universal Music Group in 2007. Her breakthrough album 'Lost & Found' earned two Grammy nominations, and she has since released a string of acclaimed albums, earning fifteen Grammy nominations and winning Best Traditional R&B Performance in 2021 for 'Anything For You.' Ledisi is also known for her acting roles, notably portraying Mahalia Jackson in 'Selma' and 'Remember Me: The Mahalia Jackson Story'[1][2][3].

Ledisi’s musical style is rooted in neo soul, blending classic soul influences with contemporary R&B, jazz, and gospel. Her powerful, emotive vocals and commitment to artistic integrity have made her a respected figure in modern soul music. Beyond her recordings, Ledisi has advocated for artists’ rights, served as a Trustee of the Recording Academy, and received an honorary Doctorate from Berklee College of Music in 2024, cementing her legacy as both a performer and industry leader[3][7].
