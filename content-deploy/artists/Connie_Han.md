## Biography
Connie Han, born February 4, 1996, in Los Angeles, California, is an American composer and pianist known for her work in jazz, 20th-century classical, and experimental music.  Born to Chinese parents who were both professional musicians, Han began piano lessons at the age of five, initially under her mother's tutelage.  Her interest in jazz blossomed during high school, where she studied with drummer Bill Wysaske, a pivotal figure in her early musical development.  Instead of pursuing higher education in music, Han chose to embark on a professional career at the young age of 17, with Wysaske serving as the musical director for her trio.

Han's musical journey began with the self-released *The Richard Rodgers Songbook* in 2015, produced by Wysaske.  This led to a significant contract with Mack Avenue Records, resulting in the release of *Crime Zone* in 2018.  This album, featuring seven original compositions by Han, showcased her talent alongside musicians such as Edwin Livingston (bass), Walter Smith III (saxophone), and Brian Swartz (trumpet).  The album's title track drew inspiration from films like *Blade Runner* and the anime *Akira*.  *Crime Zone* garnered critical acclaim, with a *New York Times* reviewer praising Han's technical skill and historical knowledge of jazz.  In 2019, Han achieved further recognition by being named a Steinway Artist and being featured in *JAZZIZ* magazine's "The Shape of Jazz to Come: Artists to Watch in 2019".

Han's musical style, as described by critics, is characterized by unique compositional choices.  *DownBeat* reviewers noted the "angular melodies and odd, abruptly shifting meters" in her compositions on *Crime Zone*, and a different approach on her later album *Iron Starlet*, where her playing on the Fender Rhodes showcased "repeating melodic phrases and finding the right glassy tones to apply".  *JAZZIZ* magazine connected her work to the spirit and energy of influential pianists like McCoy Tyner, Chick Corea, Herbie Hancock, and Kenny Kirkland, while emphasizing her distinct artistic vision.  Her ongoing career continues to build upon this foundation.
