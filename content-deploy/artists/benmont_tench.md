# Benmont Tench

## Biography
Benjamin Montmorency 'Benmont' Tench III was born on September 7, 1953, in Gainesville, Florida. He began playing piano at an early age, giving his first recital at six, initially trained in classical music before discovering the Beatles and shifting to rock and roll. At 11, he met Tom Petty at a local music store, and they played together in The Sundowners in 1964, practicing in the Tench family garage. Tench attended Phillips Exeter Academy and later Tulane University in New Orleans as an art student, inspired by John Lennon's path, but during a college break, he sat in with Petty's band Mudcrutch and was convinced by Petty to quit school and join full-time after Petty persuaded his father.[1][3]

Mudcrutch evolved into Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers in the mid-1970s, with Tench as a founding member and primary keyboardist, playing piano and Hammond organ on all their albums. His distinctive style blends rock, rhythm and blues, country, and bluegrass influences, contributing to iconic tracks like 'Refugee,' 'Don't Do Me Like That,' and 'You Got Lucky.' Beyond the Heartbreakers, Tench became one of the most sought-after session musicians, recording with artists including Stevie Nicks on Bella Donna, Bob Dylan on Shot of Love, Johnny Cash, Roy Orbison, U2, the Rolling Stones on Hackney Diamonds, and many others. He has also written songs like 'You Little Thief' for Feargal Sharkey and 'Never Be You' for Rosanne Cash, earning ASCAP awards.[1][2][4][5]

Tench remained with the Heartbreakers until their final performance at the Hollywood Bowl in 2017, shortly before Petty's death, a band he joined at 18-19 after knowing Petty since 17. His solo work includes a 2025 album highlighted in the New York Times, where he explores life post-Heartbreakers as an organist, pianist, singer, and songwriter known for his versatility across keys.[1][2][4][6]

## Fun Facts
- Tench quit Tulane University art school to join Mudcrutch full-time after Tom Petty convinced his father of his music career potential.[1]
- He once played electric piano through a Marshall stack so loud at a school auditorium that it cracked the ceiling, blending rock influences like James Brown.[4]
- During early Bob Dylan tours with the Heartbreakers, chaotic rehearsals involved cocaine use and Dylan changing keys constantly, but they became great.[4]
- Tench co-wrote 'You Little Thief,' a top 5 UK/Australian hit for Feargal Sharkey in 1985, and 'Never Be You,' a #1 US Country hit for Rosanne Cash.[1]
