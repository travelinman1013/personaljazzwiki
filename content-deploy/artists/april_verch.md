## Biography
April Verch (born April 7, 1978) is a Canadian fiddler, singer, and step dancer known for carrying the traditional music and dance of the Ottawa Valley onto stages around the world.[3][1] Raised in the small community of Rankin in northeastern Ontario, she grew up immersed in local fiddle tunes, country music, and social dances, attending weekend festivals and watching her father play in a country dance band.[1][5] She began step dancing at age three and took her first fiddle lesson at six, soon performing at fairs, festivals, and television shows, often alongside her step-dance teachers Buster and Pauline Brown.[1][4] Her early promise led her to formal study at the Berklee College of Music, where she learned from noted string educators such as Matt Glaser and Darol Anger, deepening her grounding in North American fiddle traditions.[1]

In her late teens Verch achieved major success on the Canadian contest circuit, winning the Canadian Grand Masters Fiddling Championship at 18 and the Canadian Open Old-Time Fiddlers’ Contest at 19, then turning professional soon after.[1] She first toured as a sidemusician with acts including Canadian country star Tommy Hunter and Celtic pop band Mad Pudding before launching the April Verch Band in 2000.[1][2] With that group she has toured four continents, performing in 14 countries and appearing at venues such as the Kennedy Center and the Ryman Auditorium, while releasing a catalog of recordings that includes at least 14 solo albums, two of which received JUNO Award nominations.[1][2] Alongside her bandleading, she has been part of the Canadian fiddle supergroup Bowfire and has toured as a special guest with Irish tenor John McDermott, further broadening her audience.[1]

Verch’s musical style is rooted in the Ottawa Valley fiddle tradition but also embraces American old-time, country, and other folk influences, often combining intricate bowing with precise step dancing and a clear, gentle singing voice.[1][2][9] Since 2016 she has also co-led a duo project with American old-time musician Joe Newberry, and in recent years she has toured extensively as a duo with her husband and musical partner Cody Walters, whose banjo, guitar, and bass playing complement her fiddle and dance.[1][2] Widely regarded as one of the leading tradition-bearers of her generation, Verch is celebrated for preserving regional Canadian styles while presenting them with contemporary vitality, using performance, composition, and teaching to connect audiences to living folk traditions.[1][2][7]

## Fun Facts
- April Verch started step dancing at just three years old and took up the fiddle at six, performing publicly as a child at fairs, festivals, and on television.[1][5]
- By her late teens she had won both the Canadian Grand Masters Fiddling Championship (at 18) and the Canadian Open Old-Time Fiddlers’ Contest (at 19), two of the country’s most prestigious fiddle titles.[1]
- She often sings, fiddles, and step dances simultaneously on stage—sometimes adding sandpaper foot percussion at the same time—creating a highly choreographed, multi-layered solo performance.[1][2]
- During the COVID-19 lockdowns, Verch and her husband Cody Walters developed a dedicated fiddle–banjo duo show out of necessity, which evolved into a key ongoing format in their touring career.[2]
