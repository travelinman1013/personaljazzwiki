## Biography
Jacob Collier, born on 2 August 1994 in North London, England, is an English singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, producer, and educator whose career began with homemade multi-instrumental videos uploaded to YouTube starting in 2011, including a vocal arrangement of 'Pure Imagination' and a 2013 rendition of Stevie Wonder's 'Don't You Worry 'bout a Thing' that went viral.[1] In 2014, his videos caught the attention of jazz legends Herbie Hancock and Quincy Jones, leading to friendships and mentorship opportunities, after which he chose to remain independent and self-produce his debut album *In My Room* in his family home's music room, released in 2016.[1] Collier's musical style blends jazz, pop, funk, and harmonic complexity, often featuring real-time vocal harmonizing via custom instruments, looping stations, and extensive collaborations, as showcased in his ambitious *Djesse* series (Vols. 1-4, 2018-2024).[1][2]

Collier's career skyrocketed with Grammy wins starting in 2020 for *Djesse Vol. 1* and *Vol. 2*, making history as the first British artist to win Grammys for his first four albums, including awards for 'All Night Long,' 'Moon River,' 'He Won't Hold You,' and 'Bridge Over Troubled Water' from *Djesse Vol. 4* in 2025.[1] He toured extensively with innovative one-man shows featuring synchronized 3D video loops and performed at major festivals like Montreux Jazz, while contributing to projects like Coldplay's *Everyday Life* and *Music of the Spheres*, Stormzy's *This Is What I Mean*, and scoring for *The Boss Baby* with Hans Zimmer.[1] His emphasis on collaboration expanded in *Djesse*, drawing from a 'dream list' of artists to create shared sound worlds beyond his solo roots.[2]

Collier's legacy lies in his Grammy record of five consecutive albums with wins, his pioneering live performances, and influence on modern harmonic and production techniques, positioning him as a genre-defying force in contemporary music who values joy, dimensionality, and communal creativity.[1][2]
