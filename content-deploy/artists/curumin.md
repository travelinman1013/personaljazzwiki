## Biography
Curumin is the stage name of Luciano Nakata Albuquerque, a Brazilian vocalist, multi-instrumentalist and producer born on July 28, 1976, in São Paulo, Brazil, to Spanish and Japanese parents.[4][1] Growing up in the urban sprawl of São Paulo, he began making music very young, reportedly forming his first band at the age of eight and experimenting on household pots and pans before moving on to drums, keyboards and studio gear.[2][5] Immersed in the eclectic landscape of Música Popular Brasileira (MPB), samba and imported soul and funk, he absorbed the work of groundbreaking artists who mixed Brazilian rhythms with American grooves, shaping his own hybrid musical identity.[3][6]

In the 2000s Curumin emerged as part of a new wave of Brazilian artists updating MPB with electronic production, hip-hop and global funk. His debut album, "Achados e Perdidos" (2005), was first released in Brazil and then internationally after he was discovered by California hip‑hop duo Blackalicious, who issued the record in the United States and helped introduce him to a wider audience.[1][3] The follow-up "JapanPopShow" (2008) expanded his reach with a distinctive blend of samba, reggae, electronica, funk and hip‑hop, leading to appearances at major festivals including Central Park SummerStage, Montreal Jazz Festival, and San Francisco’s Stern Grove Festival, and sharing stages with artists such as Femi Kuti and Jorge Ben.[1] Later albums like "Arrocha" further explored sensual, groove-heavy soundscapes built from MPC-based electronics, layered percussion, guitars and bass, reflecting his stated goal of connecting Brazilian traditions with a forward-looking, minimalist aesthetic influenced in part by his Japanese heritage.[1]

Musically, Curumin situates himself within the MPB and "new MPB" continuum, but with a pronounced affection for tropicalia, funk and hip‑hop production techniques.[1][3] Critics have compared his playful, sample‑savvy approach and soul-inflected vocals to artists like Beck, while noting clear lineage from MPB innovators who fused samba with soul, funk and Afro‑pop.[3] Though he has attained international recognition—helped by placements like his track "Guerreiro" in a Nike World Cup advertisement and inclusion on a Natalie Portman-curated compilation—he has consistently aligned himself with Brazil’s alternative scene, emphasizing creativity over mainstream polish and advocating for music that stretches the boundaries of Brazilian popular sound.[1]
