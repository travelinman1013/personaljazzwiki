## Biography
The Royal Society Jazz Orchestra (RSJO), founded and led by multi-instrumentalist, bandleader, musical historian, vocalist, and composer Don Neely, emerged in the mid-1970s in the San Francisco Bay Area as a premier ensemble dedicated to authentic renditions of 1920s hot jazz and 1930s swing-era dance music. Inspired by legends like Benny Goodman, Fletcher Henderson, Duke Ellington, and Count Basie, Neely formed the band after graduating in 1976, initially calling it the Royal Society Dance Orchestra—a name drawn from discography books by Brian Rust—before shifting to 'Jazz Orchestra' following their 1977 Sacramento Jazz Festival appearance. Early gigs included a San Jose pizza parlor rehearsal space leading to openings like Bullock’s department store and the Don Menza Quartet at Flint Center, with Neely strictly playing 1919-1927 music that captivated audiences.[1][2]

The orchestra quickly became a Bay Area staple, performing for decades at venues like Turk Murphy’s Earthquake McGoon’s at Pier 39, San Francisco’s Mark Hopkins Hotel, public concerts, private parties, corporate events, and radio, while recording over 300 studio tracks and 17 albums. Key developments included the 1983 addition of vocalist Carla Normand, introduced by first manager Ellen Farmer, who became Neely’s wife and elevated the band’s sound despite initial resistance and a temporary breakup; support from promoters like David Fowler and journalist Herb Caen boosted visibility. By the mid-1980s, they peaked at three gigs weekly, though larger 11-piece formats led to smaller units like Neely’s Swingtet and Rhythm Aces by 2000 amid rising costs. Hailed by critic Philip Elwood as “the best band of their type in the world,” RSJO delighted global audiences with meticulous phrasing and spirit of originals.[1][2][3]

After nearly five decades, the RSJO announced retirement at the end of 2025, capping a legacy as a torchbearer for America’s Jazz Age and Swing Era music, influencing revivalists worldwide through festivals, tea dances like the Gatsby Summer Afternoon, and a 1986 TV special. Neely continues performing with variants like the 11-piece Royal Jazz Society Orchestra.[1][2]
