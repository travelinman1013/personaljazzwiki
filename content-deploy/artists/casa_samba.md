## Biography
Casa Samba is a New Orleans–based Brazilian percussion and dance ensemble and cultural school founded in 1987, recognized as the first samba school in Louisiana and the U.S. South.[2][4] Created by Mestre Curtis Pierre together with Bill Lennon and Chuk and Carolyn Barber, the group emerged from Pierre’s decades‑long study of Brazilian music, dance, and Capoeira and his commitment to connecting African‑diasporic cultures in the United States to their counterparts in Brazil.[1][2] On July 21, 1993, the City of New Orleans formally acknowledged Casa Samba’s cultural impact when Mayor Sidney Barthelemy issued a proclamation in its honor, underscoring its role in enriching the city’s musical and cultural life.[2][4]

Over more than three decades, Casa Samba has developed into a multi‑member “percussion and dance extravaganza” that presents the rhythms, songs, dances, costumes, and theatrical aspects of Brazilian Carnival and Afro‑Brazilian traditions for U.S. audiences.[5][6] The ensemble’s shows blend traditional samba‑school bateria (drumline), vocals, Afro‑Brazilian dance, and elements of theater to “capture the spirit of Carnival in Brasil” while highlighting connections between Brazilian culture and the African diaspora in New Orleans.[5][6] In addition to stage performances at events such as Super Bowl‑related parades, festivals, Mardi Gras balls, and commercial projects, Casa Samba operates as an educational institution, offering classes in Brazilian percussion, samba and Afro‑Brazilian dance, Capoeira, and broader cultural history, as well as youth programming like the community group Samba Kids.[1][3][6]

Casa Samba’s musical style is rooted in Rio‑style escola de samba traditions—large drum ensembles, call‑and‑response songs, and Carnival choreography—infused with Afro‑Brazilian rhythms and a New Orleans sensibility shaped by its largely American membership.[1][6][7] Under the artistic direction of Mestre Curtis Pierre and Brazilian master drummer Jorge “Alabê” Bezerra, the group has become an important bridge for cultural exchange, bringing Brazilian masters to New Orleans since the early 1990s and building a local community of American practitioners devoted to Brazilian music and dance.[1][7] This legacy positions Casa Samba as both a performance troupe and a long‑standing cultural hub, instrumental in popularizing Brazilian samba and Afro‑Brazilian arts across the Gulf South.[1][2][6][7]
