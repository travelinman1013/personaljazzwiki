## Biography
The Bright Light Quartet was a traditional vocal group active in the early 1960s, known for their performances of classic blues, country blues, and traditional folk songs. The group featured Lawrence Hodge and Arnold Fisher as notable members and was recorded by folklorist Alan Lomax during a field session on April 6, 1960. Their repertoire included songs such as 'Hey, Hey, Honey,' 'Sweet Roseanna,' and 'Poor Lazarus,' which reflect the deep-rooted traditions of African American spiritual and folk music of the American South.

The group's performances are characterized by rich vocal harmonies and a raw, unadorned approach that captures the essence of early 20th-century blues and gospel quartets. Their recordings, preserved in the Lomax Digital Archive, serve as important documentation of the era's musical landscape and the enduring influence of African American folk traditions. While the Bright Light Quartet did not achieve commercial fame, their work has been recognized by ethnomusicologists and collectors as a vital piece of American musical heritage.
