## Biography
Blanche Calloway (1902–1978) was a pioneering American jazz singer, composer, and bandleader, best known for leading the group Blanche Calloway and Her Joy Boys in the early 1930s. Born in Baltimore, Maryland, she began performing professionally by age 19, quickly gaining a reputation for her dynamic stage presence and bold, high-energy performances. After studying music at Morgan State College, she left to pursue a career in show business, appearing in notable productions such as 'Shuffle Along' and performing at Chicago's prestigious Sunset Café, where she recorded with Louis Armstrong.

In 1931, Calloway was recruited by Andy Kirk to sing with his Twelve Clouds of Joy, but after a failed attempt to take over the band’s leadership, she formed her own group, Blanche Calloway and Her Joy Boys. This ensemble was groundbreaking as she became the first Black woman to front an all-male jazz orchestra. The band featured future jazz luminaries like Ben Webster and Cozy Cole, and recorded extensively for labels such as RCA Victor. Despite her regional success and innovative leadership, Calloway’s career was often overshadowed by her younger brother, Cab Calloway, who openly credited her as a major influence on his own flamboyant style and stagecraft.

Blanche Calloway’s legacy extends beyond her musical achievements. She broke racial and gender barriers in the jazz world, later managing nightclubs, mentoring future stars like Ruth Brown, and becoming a civil rights activist. Her career paved the way for future generations of women and African American musicians, and her influence is still acknowledged by historians and jazz artists today.
