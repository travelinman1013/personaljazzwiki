## Biography
John Henry Barbee, born William George Tucker on November 14, 1905, in Henning, Tennessee, was a prominent American blues singer and guitarist known for his deeply expressive style rooted in the country and Delta blues traditions[1][2][4][6]. Growing up in the rural South, Barbee worked on farms across Arkansas, Mississippi, and Alabama during the Great Depression, honing his craft by performing blues in local juke joints and on street corners[5]. His music reflected the hardships and resilience of African American life in the early 20th century, characterized by a raw, unaffected vocal delivery and superb guitar work that was highly regarded by his contemporaries[3].

Barbee’s career spanned from the 1930s to the 1960s, though he remained relatively obscure for much of his life. He recorded a handful of tracks in the 1930s, but it was not until the blues revival of the early 1960s that he gained wider recognition, particularly in Europe. Barbee toured with the American Folk Blues Festival, sharing the stage with other legendary blues artists and captivating audiences with his authentic rural sound[2][3]. Tragically, his resurgence was cut short when he died in Chicago on November 3, 1964, just as he was beginning to receive broader acclaim[2]. Despite his limited discography, Barbee’s legacy endures as a pure and powerful voice of classic country blues.
