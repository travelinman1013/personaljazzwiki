## Biography
Herb Ellis and Joe Pass were two of the most influential jazz guitarists of the 20th century, each leaving a distinct mark on the genre before joining forces for memorable collaborations. Herb Ellis, born in Farmersville, Texas in 1921, developed his musical skills early, attending North Texas State University and quickly moving into professional bands, including those led by Glen Gray and Jimmy Dorsey. His career took off in the 1950s as a member of the Oscar Peterson Trio, where his blues-infused, swinging style became a defining element of the group's sound. After leaving the Peterson Trio, Ellis became a fixture in both jazz performance and studio work, collaborating with a wide range of artists and championing emerging talents.

Joe Pass, born Joseph Anthony Jacobi Passalacqua in New Brunswick, New Jersey in 1929, began playing guitar at age nine and was performing professionally by his teens. After overcoming personal struggles, Pass re-emerged in the early 1960s as a virtuoso soloist and a highly sought-after collaborator. His technical mastery and inventive approach to chord-melody playing set new standards for jazz guitar. Pass recorded prolifically, both as a leader and alongside jazz luminaries such as Oscar Peterson, Ella Fitzgerald, and Duke Ellington. His solo albums, especially the 'Virtuoso' series, are considered benchmarks in jazz guitar.

Ellis and Pass's partnership, most notably on albums like 'Two for the Road,' showcased a remarkable interplay between two masters, blending Ellis's bluesy lyricism with Pass's bebop sophistication. Their collaborations are celebrated for their conversational improvisation and mutual respect, influencing generations of guitarists and solidifying their legacy as pillars of jazz guitar.
