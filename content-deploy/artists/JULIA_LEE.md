## Biography
Julia Lee was born on October 31, 1902, in Boonville, Missouri, and raised in Kansas City. She began her musical career early, performing with her father's string trio and later joining her brother George E. Lee's band, George E. Lee and His Novelty Singing Orchestra, around 1920. This band was a significant rival to the Bennie Moten Orchestra and included notable musicians like Charlie Parker. After her brother's band disbanded in 1935, Lee launched a solo career, becoming a major figure in the post-World War II blues revival. She was known for her husky voice, straightforward piano style, and risqué songs, often described as 'the songs my mother taught me not to sing.' Her hits included 'Snatch and Grab It,' 'King Size Papa,' and 'Gotta Gimme Whatcha Got,' which were recorded with Capitol Records starting in 1944. Lee's popularity peaked in the late 1940s, but she remained a beloved performer in Kansas City until her death on December 8, 1958. She was married to Frank Duncan, a baseball player and manager for the Kansas City Monarchs. Lee's legacy as 'Kansas City's Sweetheart of Song' endures, with her music continuing to influence blues and jazz artists. Her performances were not only musically impactful but also visually distinctive, with her signature black lace gowns and hairstyles. In 1949, she performed at the White House, a testament to her national recognition.
