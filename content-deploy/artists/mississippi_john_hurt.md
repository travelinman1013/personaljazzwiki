## Biography
Mississippi John Hurt, born John Smith Hurt in Teoc, Mississippi (Carroll County) in either 1892 or 1893, was a seminal figure in American country blues and folk music. Raised in the rural hill country rather than the Mississippi Delta, Hurt began playing guitar at age nine, inspired by a local schoolteacher. By his teens, he was performing at local dances and gatherings, often collaborating with both Black and white musicians in the racially mixed string band scene of his region. His gentle, intricate fingerpicking style and warm, conversational singing set him apart from the more intense Delta blues artists.

In 1928, Hurt recorded several tracks for Okeh Records in Memphis and New York, including classics like 'Frankie,' 'Stack O'Lee,' 'Avalon Blues,' and 'Candy Man Blues.' However, the Great Depression halted his recording career, and he returned to farm work in Avalon, Mississippi, playing music only locally. Hurt was rediscovered in the early 1960s after his 1928 recordings appeared on 'The Anthology of American Folk Music.' Enthusiast Tom Hoskins tracked him down in Avalon in 1963, leading to a late-life renaissance. Hurt moved to Washington, D.C., became a fixture in the folk revival, performed at major festivals, and recorded extensively until his death in 1966. His music, rooted in pre-blues traditions and ragtime, left an enduring legacy, influencing generations of folk and blues musicians.
