## Biography
Walter Trout, born March 6, 1951, in Ocean City, New Jersey, is a celebrated American blues guitarist, singer, and songwriter whose career spans over five decades. Trout’s early fascination with music was sparked by blues legends such as B.B. King, Muddy Waters, and John Lee Hooker, and he began playing guitar at age ten. By his teens, he was performing in local bands on the Jersey coast before moving to Los Angeles in the late 1960s, where he became a sought-after sideman for icons like John Lee Hooker, Percy Mayfield, Big Mama Thornton, and Joe Tex.

Trout’s major breakthrough came in the early 1980s when he joined the legendary blues-rock band Canned Heat as lead guitarist, touring extensively and gaining international recognition. He then spent five years as the lead guitarist for John Mayall’s Bluesbreakers, following in the footsteps of guitar greats like Eric Clapton and Peter Green. In 1989, Trout launched his solo career with the Walter Trout Band, quickly establishing himself in Europe with his debut album 'Life in the Jungle.' His discography now includes over 30 albums, with highlights such as 'Blues for the Modern Daze,' 'Battle Scars,' and 'We’re All in This Together.'

Trout’s style is marked by fiery guitar solos, emotive vocals, and a deep connection to the blues tradition, yet he brings a modern sensibility and raw authenticity to his music. Despite facing life-threatening health challenges, including a liver transplant that required him to relearn how to play guitar, Trout’s resilience and passion have made him a living legend. His electrifying live performances and dedication to the blues have inspired generations of musicians, ensuring his enduring legacy in the genre.
