## Biography
ESG is a pioneering band formed in 1978 in the South Bronx, New York City, by the Scroggins sisters—Renee, Valerie, Deborah, and Marie—along with friend Tito Libran. Raised in a working-class family, the sisters were encouraged by their mother, who bought them instruments to keep them engaged and out of trouble. Largely self-taught, they developed a distinctive sound that fused post-punk, funk, and post-disco minimalism, characterized by sparse arrangements, hypnotic basslines, and polyrhythmic percussion. Their music quickly found a home in New York’s vibrant no wave and post-punk scenes, with early support from Ed Bahlman of 99 Records, who managed and produced them.

ESG’s 1981 debut EP, produced by Martin Hannett (noted for his work with Joy Division and New Order), featured tracks like 'Moody' and 'UFO,' which became underground dance anthems and were widely sampled in hip-hop, dance, and indie rock. Over the decades, ESG’s lineup evolved to include daughters and other relatives, but the group remained a family affair, led by Renee Scroggins. Despite periods of inactivity, ESG continued to release music and perform live, with their minimalist funk and dance-punk style exerting a profound influence on multiple genres. Their legacy is cemented by their status as one of the most sampled bands in history and as forebearers of the dance-punk and hip-hop movements.
