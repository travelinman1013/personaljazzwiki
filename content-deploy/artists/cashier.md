## Quick Info

- **Origin**: Lafayette, Louisiana, United States

## Biography
Cashier is a South Louisiana rock band formed in the summer of 2021, emerging from the vibrant DIY community of Lafayette, Louisiana.[1][2] The band comprises Troy Lusk and Matt Sandrin as responsible agents, crafting a distinctive sound that bridges the gap between pre-millennial dissonant rock aesthetics and contemporary songwriting sensibilities.[1] Their musical approach synthesizes fuzzy, feedback-driven soundscapes with pop catchiness and emotional sincerity, creating tracks that convey both urgency and serenity in equal measure.[1]

Cashier's sonic palette draws heavily from shoegaze and alt-rock traditions, positioning them within a broader alternative rock revival occurring in their region.[2] The band's live performances are characterized by a sense of massiveness and kinetic energy, where frenzied noise cuts through melody, blurring the distinction between performing and channeling raw emotion.[1] Since their formation, they have rapidly expanded beyond the South Louisiana DIY circuit, establishing a worldwide presence (excluding Europe) and building a dedicated following through platforms like Spotify and Bandcamp.[1][2]

The band represents a new generation of artists drawing inspiration from 1990s alternative rock and shoegaze movements, applying these influences to modern songwriting frameworks that emphasize both technical proficiency and emotional authenticity.[1] Their emergence reflects broader trends in contemporary rock music, where artists are revisiting and recontextualizing the sonic innovations of grunge and alternative rock eras for contemporary audiences.
