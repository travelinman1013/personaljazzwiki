## Biography
Robert Pete Williams was born on March 14, 1914, in Zachary, Louisiana, into a sharecropping family with no formal education. He spent his childhood performing agricultural labor, picking cotton and cutting sugar cane before moving to Baton Rouge at age 20, where he fashioned his first guitar from a cigar box with copper strings. Self-taught through studying recordings by Blind Lemon Jefferson and Peetie Wheatstraw, Williams developed his distinctive style characterized by unconventional guitar tunings and improvised structures. From the 1930s through the 1950s, he performed at local events including church gatherings, fish fries, and dances while continuing to work in lumber yards.

Williams' life took a dramatic turn in 1956 when he fatally shot a man in a nightclub in an act he claimed was self-defense, resulting in a life sentence at Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola. His musical career was rescued when folklorists Dr. Harry Oster and Richard Allen discovered him performing in prison and recorded his songs about incarceration. Their advocacy led to his pardon and sentence commutation to 12 years in 1958. Though initially restricted by servitude parole requirements, Williams gradually gained freedom to perform, appearing at the 1964 Newport Folk Festival and subsequently touring throughout the United States and Europe by 1965-1966. He performed at major festivals including the 1970 Ann Arbor Blues Festival and continued recording until his death on December 31, 1980, in Rosedale, Louisiana.

Williams' legacy as a Louisiana blues pioneer was cemented through his induction into the Louisiana Blues Hall of Fame and the Blues Hall of Fame in 2014. His music, often centered on prison experiences and personal struggles, influenced subsequent generations of blues and rock musicians. His unconventional approach to guitar playing and songwriting established him as a distinctive voice in American blues, with his recordings appearing in multiple documentary films and his compositions covered by notable artists across genres.
