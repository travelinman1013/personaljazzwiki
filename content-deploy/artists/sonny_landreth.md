## Biography
Clyde Vernon "Sonny" Landreth, born February 1, 1951, in Canton, Mississippi, is an acclaimed American blues guitarist, songwriter, and bandleader renowned for his pioneering slide guitar technique. Raised in Lafayette, Louisiana, Landreth was immersed in the region's rich musical traditions, including blues, jazz, zydeco, and rock and roll. He began his musical journey as a trumpet player before switching to guitar in high school, forming his first band, Magic, and quickly becoming captivated by songwriting and performance.[1][2][3]

Landreth's career took a significant turn when he joined zydeco legend Clifton Chenier's Red Hot Louisiana Band as the first white member, deeply absorbing the rhythms and spirit of Louisiana's Creole music. Over the decades, Landreth developed a unique slide guitar style, fretting behind the slide and employing intricate right-hand techniques, which earned him the moniker "King of Slydeco." His solo albums, such as "South of I-10" and "Blacktop Run," blend blues, Cajun, zydeco, and rock, often featuring collaborations with artists like Eric Johnson, Mark Knopfler, and Allen Toussaint. Landreth's innovative approach and evocative songwriting have made him a revered figure among musicians and fans alike, with Eric Clapton calling him "one of the most advanced guitarists in the world."[1][4][6]

Landreth's influence extends beyond his recordings and performances, as he has contributed to hundreds of sessions for artists across genres and inspired a new generation of guitarists with his technical mastery and deep sense of place. His legacy is marked by his role in bridging musical traditions and expanding the expressive possibilities of the guitar, particularly within the context of Louisiana's vibrant musical landscape.[2][6]
