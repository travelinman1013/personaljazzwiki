## Biography
Ralph Edward Tresvant was born on May 16, 1968, in Roxbury, Massachusetts, where he grew up surrounded by music and childhood friends who would shape his artistic future. While in junior high school, Tresvant formed a musical group called New Edition with friends Ronnie DeVoe, Bobby Brown, Ricky Bell, and Michael Bivins. The group was discovered at a talent show by producer Maurice Starr, who signed them to Streetwise Records in 1983 with the vision of creating a "newer edition" of The Jackson 5. Tresvant's smooth, approachable vocal style quickly became the signature sound of New Edition, establishing him as the group's lead vocalist during their rise to prominence in the 1980s R&B and new jack swing era.

Following New Edition's success, Tresvant launched a solo career that proved equally successful. His self-titled debut album, released in 1990, achieved double-platinum status, selling two million copies and establishing him as a formidable solo artist. The album's lead single "Sensitivity" spent 20 weeks on the U.S. R&B Singles chart, including two weeks at Number One, while follow-up hits "Do What I Gotta Do" and "Stone Cold Gentleman" (featuring Bobby Brown) solidified his commercial appeal. Tresvant won the Billboard Music Award for "No. 1 New Pop Male Artist" in 1991, cementing his status as a leading figure in R&B music.

Throughout his career spanning over four decades, Tresvant has maintained a dual presence as both a solo artist and member of New Edition, participating in the group's reunion albums "Home Again" (1996) and "It's Goin' Down" (1998), as well as touring ventures including "The Culture Tour" in 2022. His legacy was further cemented in 2017 when The New Edition Story, a BET miniseries depicting his life and career with the group, became the highest-rated biopic miniseries in cable history. In 2023, Tresvant became host of the syndicated radio show "Love and R&B," continuing his influence in the music industry. His silky-smooth vocal delivery, charismatic stage presence, and ability to connect with audiences through heartfelt lyrics have made him an enduring icon in R&B music.
