## Biography
Jimmy Liggins (born James L. Elliott, October 14, 1918 – July 21, 1983) was a pioneering American R&B guitarist, singer, and bandleader, known for his energetic jump blues and boogie-woogie style. Born in Newby, Oklahoma, he moved with his family to San Diego, California in 1932, where he initially pursued a career as a professional boxer under the name 'Kid Zulu.' After working as a driver for his brother Joe Liggins' band, the Honeydrippers, Jimmy was inspired to form his own group, the Drops of Joy, in 1946.

Liggins signed with Specialty Records in 1947, quickly making his mark with the hit 'Cadillac Boogie,' a song considered a forerunner of rock and roll. His raw, driving sound and wild stage presence set him apart from his brother's smoother, swing-influenced style. Throughout the late 1940s and early 1950s, Liggins and the Drops of Joy were among the most successful jump blues acts, releasing influential tracks like 'Tear Drop Blues' and 'I Ain't Drunk.' Despite setbacks—including an accidental shooting in 1949—he continued to record and tour, later founding his own label, Duplex Records, in 1958. Liggins' electrifying performances and manic delivery left a lasting impact on the evolution of rock and roll, influencing artists such as Little Richard, Chuck Berry, Bill Haley, and Elvis Presley. He spent his later years in Durham, North Carolina, running a record shop and studio, and promoting music until his death in 1983.
