## Biography
The Youngbloods were an American folk rock band formed in 1965 in New York, New York, rooted in the folk scenes of Boston and Greenwich Village. Frontman Jesse Colin Young, who began as a solo folk artist with unsuccessful albums like 'The Soul of A City Boy' (1964) on Capitol Records, teamed up with guitarist Jerry Corbitt, a former bluegrass musician. They initially performed as a duo before adding guitarist/pianist Lowell 'Banana' Levinger and drummer Joe Bauer, with Young switching to bass after other candidates like Felix Pappalardi and Harvey Brooks didn't fit. Signed to RCA Records, they became the house band at Cafe Au Go Go and released their self-titled debut in 1967, blending blues, jug band, and emerging folk rock styles.[1][3][4]

After modest early success with singles like 'Grizzly Bear' and 'Get Together' (written by Dino Valenti), the band relocated to the San Francisco Bay Area in 1967, embracing California psychedelia. Jerry Corbitt departed around this time, leaving a trio that recorded their breakthrough album 'Elephant Mountain' (1969), produced by Charlie Daniels. A re-release of 'Get Together' that year, boosted by use in National Conference of Christians and Jews ads, became their signature million-selling hit, peaking at #5 on the Billboard Hot 100. They launched Raccoon Records and released further albums, though later works grew inconsistent amid lineup changes.[1][2][3][4]

The band splintered in 1972 when Young left; Levinger, Bauer, and friend Michael Kane continued briefly as Banana And The Bunch before folding. They reunited briefly in 1984-1985 for a tour with new members David Perper and Scott Lawrence. Despite critical acclaim, The Youngbloods remained a one-hit wonder, leaving a legacy in folk rock and psychedelia through their harmonious, peace-anthem sound.[1][5]
