## Biography
Margo Price, born April 15, 1983, is an American country singer-songwriter, producer, and author based in Nashville.  Her musical journey began in Aledo, Illinois, where she developed her skills playing piano and singing in a church choir.  Furthering her artistic foundation, she studied dance and theater at Northern Illinois University.  Price cites a range of influential artists, including Tom Petty, Janis Joplin, Bobbie Gentry, Emmylou Harris, Bonnie Raitt, and Dolly Parton, as shaping her musical style.  Her own vocal style has drawn comparisons to Loretta Lynn and Tammy Wynette, and her great-uncle, Bobby Fischer, was a songwriter for prominent country artists like George Jones and Reba McEntire.

Price's career blossomed in Nashville, where she held various jobs while pursuing her musical ambitions.  She was a member of the politically-focused band Secret Handshake with her husband, guitarist Jeremy Ivey, before forming Buffalo Clover and later Margo and the Pricetags, a band described as a "supergroup" featuring collaborators like Sturgill Simpson and Kenny Vaughan.  Her debut solo album, *Midwest Farmer's Daughter*, recorded at Sun Studio in Memphis and engineered by Matt Ross-Spang, was released in 2016 by Third Man Records.  This success led to appearances on *Saturday Night Live*, *Later... with Jools Holland*, *Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown*, and *Charlie Rose*, showcasing her talent to a wider audience.  She subsequently released the albums *All American Made* (2017), *That's How Rumors Get Started* (2020), and *Strays* (2023), along with a four-track EP, *Weakness* (2017).  Her work has garnered critical acclaim, including a Grammy nomination for Best New Artist in 2018, and significant popularity in the UK, where her album topped the UK Country Albums Chart.  In 2024, she joined the board of directors for Farm Aid and published her memoir, *Maybe We’ll Make It: A Memoir*.

Price's musical style blends country influences with a raw, honest storytelling approach, often focusing on "life's cruel twists and unjust turns," as noted by the *Nashville Scene*.  Her performances are energetic, featuring both acoustic and electric guitar, and often include a drum jam as a coda.  Her work has established her as a significant figure in the East Nashville music scene, described as "a singular and vital part of this scene, as a thing unto herself" by fellow musician Aaron Lee Tasjan.  Her collaborations extend beyond her band, including recent work with Mike Campbell on a Tom Petty cover and Orville Peck on his *Stampede* album.  Her ongoing career demonstrates her continued influence and impact on the country music landscape.
