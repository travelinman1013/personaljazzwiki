## Biography
Warren William Zevon (January 24, 1947 – September 7, 2003) was an American singer-songwriter renowned for his sharp wit, dark humor, and literary lyricism. Born in Chicago, Illinois, to a Russian Jewish father and a Midwestern mother of English descent, Zevon was a classically trained pianist who gravitated toward songwriting and the music industry from a young age. He began his career in the 1960s as part of the folk-rock duo lyme & cybelle and worked as a session musician, jingle composer, and songwriter for other artists, including The Turtles. His early solo work, such as the album 'Wanted Dead or Alive' (1970), went largely unnoticed, but he gained valuable experience as a music director for the Everly Brothers and through various collaborations.[1][2][3][4]

Zevon's breakthrough came in the mid-1970s when Linda Ronstadt covered several of his songs, leading to his critically acclaimed self-titled album in 1976, produced by Jackson Browne. He achieved mainstream success with the 1978 album 'Excitable Boy,' which featured the enduring hit 'Werewolves of London' alongside other notable tracks like 'Lawyers, Guns and Money' and 'Roland the Headless Thompson Gunner.' Zevon's music blended rock, folk, and pop with sardonic storytelling, often exploring themes of mortality, absurdity, and human frailty. Despite limited commercial success, he maintained a devoted cult following and was admired by peers for his lyrical prowess and originality.[1][2][3]

Throughout his career, Zevon released a series of well-regarded albums, including 'The Envoy,' 'Sentimental Hygiene,' and 'Life'll Kill Ya.' He was a frequent guest on David Letterman's shows, where his wit and candor endeared him to audiences. Diagnosed with terminal mesothelioma in 2002, Zevon spent his final months recording the Grammy-winning album 'The Wind,' featuring collaborations with Bruce Springsteen and others. He died in Los Angeles in 2003, leaving behind a legacy as one of rock's most distinctive and literate voices. In 2025, he was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in the Musical Influence category.[1][2][3]
