## Biography
Mandrill is an American soul and funk band formed in Brooklyn, New York, in 1968 by Panamanian-born brothers Carlos, Lou, and Ric Wilson, who grew up in the Bedford–Stuyvesant neighborhood after their family moved from Panama.[1][2] Inspired by the colorful, communal mandrill primate, they chose the name to reflect both a vibrant visual identity and a family-oriented ethos.[1] With Carlos on trombone and vocals, Lou on trumpet and vocals, and Ric on saxophone and vocals, the brothers assembled an early lineup that included Claude “Coffee” Cave on keyboards, Omar Mesa on guitar, Bundie Cenac on bass, and Charlie Padro on drums, creating a large, flexible ensemble able to cover horn-driven funk, rock, jazz, Latin, and Afro-Caribbean grooves.[1][2]

Signing with Polydor, Mandrill released their self‑titled debut album in 1971, which reached the Billboard charts and introduced their genre‑blending approach.[1] They quickly followed with *Mandrill Is* (1972), featuring new bassist Fudgie Kae Solomon, and then *Composite Truth* (1973), their most commercially successful album, whose single “Fencewalk” reached No. 19 on the Billboard soul chart.[1] Through albums like *Just Outside of Town* and the expansive double LP *Mandrilland*, they became known as one of funk’s most progressive outfits, fusing funk with rock, blues, jazz, and African and Latin rhythms and earning comparisons to early Funkadelic for their experimental, psychedelic edge.[1][2] In the mid‑1970s they changed labels from Polydor to United Artists and later Arista, weathered significant lineup changes, and brought in a fourth Wilson brother, Wilfredo, on bass; releases such as *Solid*, *Beast from the East*, and *We Are One* produced notable tracks like “Funky Monkey,” “Can You Get It,” and “Too Late,” the latter appearing on the soundtrack to the cult film *The Warriors*.[1][3]

Although commercial fortunes waned by the early 1980s, leading to a recording hiatus after the 1982 album *Energize*, Mandrill’s legacy deepened over time as their 1970s catalog was rediscovered and heavily sampled by hip‑hop producers.[1][2][3] The band reunited in the 1990s, performed selectively, and released a live album recorded at the 2002 Montreux Jazz Festival, showcasing the durability of their intricate arrangements and multi‑percussion grooves.[1][3] Louis Wilson’s death in 2013 marked the passing of a founding voice, but Mandrill’s influence lives on in the work of artists who have sampled them and in the ongoing reassessment of their role as “unsung architects of funk,” recognized for expanding the boundaries of funk rock and jazz funk through cosmopolitan Afro‑Latin influences and a horn‑driven, polyrhythmic sound.[2][3][4]

## Fun Facts
- Mandrill took their name from the vividly colored West African primate, choosing it both for its striking visual symbolism and for the animal’s strong family and social structure, which mirrored the Wilson brothers’ own family-based band.[1][4]
- During their early 1970s Polydor years, Mandrill was frequently described as one of funk’s most progressive and experimental bands, with critics highlighting their willingness to stretch songs into psychedelic jams that mixed Latin percussion, jazz horn lines, and rock guitar.[1][2]
- Their song "Too Late" appeared on the soundtrack of the 1979 cult film "The Warriors," giving them a place in cinema history in addition to their studio albums.[1][3]
- Mandrill’s 1973 album "Composite Truth" not only contained their signature hit "Fencewalk" but has been singled out in later retrospectives as a high point of 1970s funk for its dense grooves and socially conscious, Afrocentric artwork and themes.[1][4]
