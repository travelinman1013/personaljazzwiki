## Biography
Parliament was an American funk band formed in 1968 by singer, songwriter, and producer George Clinton as a flagship vehicle for his expanding P‑Funk collective.[4][5] The group evolved out of Clinton’s earlier doo‑wop vocal group The Parliaments, which he had led since the late 1950s out of a Plainfield, New Jersey barbershop and which scored a hit in 1967 with “(I Wanna) Testify.”[3][4][6] After a contractual dispute caused Clinton to temporarily lose the rights to the name The Parliaments, he brought the touring rhythm section to the fore under the name Funkadelic while later reconstituting the original singers and band as Parliament, at first with essentially the same ten members working in parallel to Funkadelic.[3][4][5] Based in Plainfield and closely tied to Detroit’s music scene, Parliament’s early 1970s work grew from the soul and R&B roots of The Parliaments into a sophisticated, groove‑heavy style that fused funk with horn‑driven arrangements and studio experimentation.[3][4][6]

With the album *Up for the Down Stroke* (1974) and especially *Chocolate City* (1975) and *Mothership Connection* (1975), Parliament defined a more polished, R&B‑leaning counterpart to Funkadelic’s rock‑oriented sound, using elaborate Afrofuturist concepts, sci‑fi mythology, and theatrical stage shows built around the iconic “Mothership.”[3][4][6] Parliament’s classic‑period lineup featured Clinton as bandleader alongside key P‑Funk figures such as keyboardist Bernie Worrell, bassist Bootsy Collins, guitarist Garry Shider, horn section The Horny Horns, and many other rotating members of the larger Parliament‑Funkadelic collective.[3][4] Through the late 1970s the band scored multiple hit albums and singles on the R&B and pop charts, becoming central architects of 1970s funk and influencing everything from disco to rock.[3][4]

By the early 1980s, legal issues surrounding the use of multiple band names and record‑label changes led Clinton to dissolve Parliament and Funkadelic as separate recording and touring entities, even as he continued to perform P‑Funk repertoire with the P‑Funk All‑Stars and under his own name.[4][5] Parliament’s legacy endures in its pioneering blend of funk grooves, complex arrangements, and Afrofuturist imagery, and the band’s recordings have been heavily sampled by later generations of hip‑hop and R&B artists. Their body of work, especially *Mothership Connection* and other mid‑’70s albums, is widely regarded as foundational to modern funk and a cornerstone of the broader Parliament‑Funkadelic mythos.[3][4][6]

## Fun Facts
- Parliament’s origins trace back to a Plainfield, New Jersey barbershop where George Clinton and his co‑workers formed the doo‑wop group The Parliaments and rehearsed while cutting hair.[3][4]
- The name "Parliaments" was originally inspired by Parliament cigarettes; after a contractual dispute over that name, Clinton created Funkadelic and later relaunched the group as Parliament.[3][4]
- *Mothership Connection* (1975) not only introduced the P‑Funk "Mothership" concept but also led to elaborate live shows featuring a literal spaceship prop descending onto the stage as part of Parliament’s Afrofuturist mythology.[3][4][6]
- In the early 1980s, legal and label complications around the multiple P‑Funk band names pushed George Clinton to dissolve Parliament and Funkadelic as separate entities, though many of the same musicians continued to tour and record P‑Funk material under other banners like the P‑Funk All‑Stars.[4][5]

## Musical Connections

### Mentors/Influences
- [[james_brown|James Brown]] - Major stylistic influence on George Clinton and the P‑Funk sound, particularly in rhythmic feel, groove, and band conception. (Overall Parliament funk style and stage approach rather than one specific album; influence heard across 1970s Parliament releases such as *Up for the Down Stroke* and *Mothership Connection*.) [Influence emerging in the late 1960s and shaping Parliament’s 1970s work.[6]]
- [[sly_and_the_family_stone|Sly and the Family Stone]] - Template for integrated, experimental funk‑rock that inspired Clinton’s fusion of soul, rock, and psychedelic elements in P‑Funk. (Influence reflected in Parliament’s blend of social commentary, ensemble vocals, and psychedelic funk textures on mid‑1970s albums.) [Late 1960s–1970s as Parliament’s sound and concepts developed.[6]]
- [[jimi_hendrix|Jimi Hendrix]] - Psychedelic rock and guitar‑driven experimentation that helped shape the harder edges and space‑rock elements surrounding early Parliament/Funkadelic. (Influence most evident in the overlapping Parliament/Funkadelic guitar approach and extended jams feeding into Parliament’s early 1970s recordings.) [Late 1960s–mid‑1970s.[6]]
- [[sun_ra|Sun Ra]] - Conceptual and Afrofuturist inspiration for using outer‑space mythology, Black futurism, and elaborate stage personae. (Conceptual influence on Parliament’s *Mothership Connection* and the broader P‑Funk cosmology, including the Mothership stage show.) [Early–mid 1970s conceptual development of Parliament’s Afrofuturist imagery.[6]]

### Key Collaborators
- [[george_clinton|George Clinton]] - Founder, producer, primary songwriter, and bandleader of Parliament; he organized and directed the group and the larger P‑Funk collective. (All major Parliament releases including *Osmium* (1970), *Up for the Down Stroke* (1974), *Chocolate City* (1975), and *Mothership Connection* (1975).) [1968–early 1980s as formal Parliament bandleader, continuing to perform Parliament material thereafter.[3][4][5]]
- [[bernie_worrell|Bernie Worrell]] - Keyboardist and arranger whose synthesizer work and harmonic concepts were central to Parliament’s sound. (Key contributor across classic Parliament albums of the mid‑to‑late 1970s, including *Mothership Connection* and subsequent releases.) [Early 1970s–early 1980s within Parliament‑Funkadelic.[3][4]]
- [[bootsy_collins|Bootsy Collins]] - Bassist and co‑writer whose rubbery, melodic bass lines helped define the P‑Funk groove across both Parliament and Funkadelic. (Played and wrote on numerous Parliament tracks during the group’s mid‑’70s peak while also leading Bootsy’s Rubber Band under the P‑Funk umbrella.) [Mid‑1970s–early 1980s.[3][4]]
- [[garry_shider|Garry Shider]] - Guitarist, vocalist, and musical director figure in the P‑Funk collective; important to live and studio arrangements. (Performed and recorded extensively with Parliament on mid‑to‑late‑1970s albums and tours.) [1970s–early 1980s.[3][4]]
- [[the_horny_horns|The Horny Horns]] - Brass section that provided Parliament’s signature horn riffs and arrangements. (Featured prominently on Parliament albums from *Up for the Down Stroke* onward, including *Mothership Connection* and *Chocolate City*.) [Mid‑1970s–early 1980s.[3][4]]
- [[original_parliaments_vocalists_ray_davis_clarence_fuzzy_haskins_calvin_simon_grady_thomas|Original Parliaments vocalists (Ray Davis, Clarence "Fuzzy" Haskins, Calvin Simon, Grady Thomas)]] - Founding vocal members whose harmonies and doo‑wop roots carried over into Parliament’s ensemble vocal style. (From The Parliaments’ hit “(I Wanna) Testify” (1967) through early Parliament recordings such as *Osmium* and into the early P‑Funk era.) [Late 1950s–1970s.[3][4]]

### Artists Influenced
- [[dr._dre_and_gfunkera_hiphop|Dr. Dre and G‑funk–era hip‑hop]] - Parliament (and broader P‑Funk) recordings became a cornerstone sample source and aesthetic model for 1990s West Coast hip‑hop’s laid‑back, synth‑driven sound. (Extensive sampling of P‑Funk material across Dr. Dre’s productions; Parliament’s grooves and synth textures underpin many G‑funk tracks (documented broadly via P‑Funk influence discussions).) [Primarily late 1980s–1990s and beyond, as Parliament’s 1970s catalog was recontextualized in hip‑hop.[3]]
- [[prince|Prince]] - Drew on Parliament/Funkadelic’s mix of funk, rock, sexuality, and theatrical persona, as well as the idea of a self‑contained musical universe. (Parliament’s conceptual funk and stage theatrics informed Prince’s own blend of funk‑rock and elaborate live shows in the late 1970s and 1980s.) [Influence most apparent from Prince’s late‑1970s debut through his 1980s peak.[3][6]]
- [[red_hot_chili_peppers_and_other_funkrock_bands|Red Hot Chili Peppers and other funk‑rock bands]] - Parliament’s fusion of heavy grooves, psychedelic textures, and playful irreverence helped shape the vocabulary of later funk‑rock acts. (Influence heard broadly in RHCP’s incorporation of funk bass, groove‑centric songwriting, and high‑energy performance style, drawing on the P‑Funk tradition.) [1980s onward as funk‑rock and alternative bands absorbed 1970s P‑Funk innovations.[3]]
- [[countless_randb_funk_and_electronic_producers|Countless R&B, funk, and electronic producers]] - Parliament’s use of synthesizers, horn arrangements, and extended grooves set a template for later R&B and dance‑music production and has been extensively sampled. (Sampling and stylistic borrowing from Parliament tracks such as those on *Mothership Connection* and *Chocolate City* across later R&B, hip‑hop, and electronic releases.) [1980s to present, as Parliament’s catalog remains a core resource for producers.[3][4]]
