## Biography
A Tribe Called Quest is an American hip hop group formed in Queens, New York City, in 1985, originally composed of Q-Tip (Kamaal Fareed), Phife Dawg (Malik Taylor), Ali Shaheed Muhammad, and Jarobi White[1]. The group emerged from the vibrant New York hip hop scene, with Q-Tip and Phife Dawg growing up together in the St. Albans neighborhood, bonding over a shared love for music and culture[1]. Their early demos, crafted over Q-Tip’s pause tape beats, caught the attention of the local scene, and by 1988, they had joined the Native Tongues collective, a group of like-minded artists including Jungle Brothers, De La Soul, Queen Latifah, and Monie Love, who championed Afrocentric ideals, positivity, and eclectic sampling[1][2]. A Tribe Called Quest’s debut album, *People’s Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm* (1990), was critically acclaimed for its playful lyricism and innovative fusion of jazz, funk, soul, and rock samples, setting the stage for their reputation as pioneers of alternative hip hop and jazz rap[1][2]. Their follow-up, *The Low End Theory* (1991), is widely regarded as a landmark in hip hop, seamlessly blending jazz instrumentation with hip hop beats and socially conscious lyrics, influencing a generation of artists and listeners[1][3]. Over their career, which included a breakup in 1998 and a reunion leading to their final album *We Got It from Here... Thank You 4 Your Service* (2016), A Tribe Called Quest became one of the most respected and influential groups in hip hop history, known for their musical innovation, artistic unity, and enduring legacy[1][2].
