## Biography
Lee Murdock is an American folk singer, guitarist, and songwriter best known as a balladeer of the Great Lakes and maritime traditions. Based in Kane County, Illinois, he has spent decades collecting, arranging, and performing songs drawn from Great Lakes history, sea chanteys, and freshwater work songs, some dating back to the 1800s.[2][4][6] He released his first vinyl album, “The Grand Departure,” in 1980, marking the start of a recording career that gradually shifted from broader folk material to a deep focus on Great Lakes lore, sailors, shipwrecks, and working-waterfront communities.[2] 

Murdock is noted as a fluent six‑ and twelve‑string guitarist and accomplished finger‑style player, blending elements of ragtime, Irish, blues, and traditional folk styles with narrative, historically grounded lyrics.[3][4][5] His music combines traditional ballads with original compositions that draw on local history and personal experience, aiming to bring archival stories to contemporary audiences while preserving period language and detail.[2][4][6] Over the years he has become widely recognized in maritime and regional folk circles as a leading interpreter of Great Lakes songs, frequently performing at museums, historical societies, and maritime festivals, and helping to keep the musical heritage of the inland seas alive for new generations.[3][4][6]

Murdock’s legacy centers on his role in documenting and revitalizing Great Lakes music rather than mainstream commercial success. He has developed themed concert programs and educational presentations that trace shipping history, labor, and life on the lakes, often contextualizing each song with anecdotes from archival research and oral histories.[2][4][5][6] By combining scholarship, storytelling, and technically skilled guitar work, he has carved out a distinctive niche in North American folk music as a “Great Lakes balladeer,” inspiring interest in regional history and maritime culture through song.[3][4][6]

## Fun Facts
- Murdock is often described as a “Great Lakes balladeer” because so much of his repertoire is devoted to the history, ships, and workers of the Great Lakes region rather than the open ocean.[3][6]
- He arranges 19th‑century Great Lakes ballads, sea chanteys, and work songs specifically to appeal to modern audiences, while deliberately preserving much of the original language and historical flavor.[6]
- In live performance, he frequently pairs songs with stories drawn from archival research and local history, turning concerts into informal history lessons about sailors, shipwrecks, and waterfront communities.[2][4][6]
- His guitar work spans ragtime, Irish, blues, and folk techniques, and he performs on both six‑ and twelve‑string guitars, which he uses to create rich, orchestral accompaniments to narrative songs.[3][4][5]
