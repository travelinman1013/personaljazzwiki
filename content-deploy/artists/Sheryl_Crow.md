## Biography
Sheryl Crow, born February 11, 1962, in Kennett, Missouri, is an acclaimed American singer-songwriter, musician, and actress whose career spans more than three decades. Raised in a musical household—her mother was a piano teacher and her father a trumpet player—Crow began playing piano at age five and wrote her first song by thirteen. She attended the University of Missouri, majoring in music education, and after graduation worked as an elementary school music teacher before moving to Los Angeles to pursue her musical ambitions.

Crow’s early career included recording advertising jingles and working as a backup singer, most notably for Michael Jackson’s Bad World Tour from 1987 to 1989. She also sang backup for artists like Sting, Rod Stewart, Don Henley, and Stevie Wonder. Her breakthrough came with the 1993 release of her debut album, 'Tuesday Night Music Club,' featuring the Grammy-winning hit 'All I Wanna Do.' Crow’s music is characterized by a blend of rock, pop, country, and blues, and her raspy voice and thoughtful songwriting have earned her nine Grammy Awards and over 50 million albums sold worldwide. She continued her success with albums such as 'Sheryl Crow' (1996), 'The Globe Sessions' (1998), and 'C’mon, C’mon' (2002), and was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, cementing her legacy as a versatile and influential artist.
