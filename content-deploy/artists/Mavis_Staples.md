## Biography
Mavis Staples was born on July 10, 1939, in Chicago, Illinois, to parents Roebuck "Pops" and Oceola Staples, who had relocated from Mississippi. At age 10, she became the lead singer of the Staple Singers, a family gospel group formed by her father in the late 1940s. Despite being the youngest of four siblings, her powerful voice captured audiences immediately. In 1953, the group debuted their self-released single "These Are They" / "Faith and Grace," and by 1957 they signed with Vee-Jay Records, scoring their first major hit "Uncloudy Day." Though offered lucrative opportunities to pursue secular music as a solo artist, Mavis remained committed to singing gospel with her family throughout the 1950s and early 1960s.

The Staple Singers' transition to soul and rhythm and blues began in the late 1960s when they signed with Stax Records in Memphis, where they worked with members of Booker T. and the MGs to develop a contemporary Southern soul sound. Mavis launched her solo career in 1969 with a self-titled debut album while continuing to perform with the family group. Between 1971 and 1975, the Staple Singers achieved remarkable commercial success with eight Top 40 hits, including two number one singles: "I'll Take You There" and "Let's Do It Again." These songs, along with "Respect Yourself" and "The Weight," became enduring classics that balanced personal responsibility, dignity, and hope with messages of black pride and agency. After experimenting unsuccessfully with disco and electro-pop in the late 1970s and 1980s, Staples curtailed her musical activity as her father's health declined in the late 1990s. Following Pops' death in December 2000, she returned with renewed vigor in 2004 with "Have A Little Faith," a tribute album that marked her first major breakthrough as a solo artist.

For over 70 years, Mavis Staples has been celebrated as one of the most gifted singers of all time, with a career spanning from Chicago churches to civil rights marches alongside Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to collaborations with artists like Arcade Fire, Prince, Bob Dylan, Jeff Tweedy, and Hozier. Her unwavering commitment to equity and justice has guided both her life and art, making her a true American icon whose voice has stirred audiences across generations and genres.
