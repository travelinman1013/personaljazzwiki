## Biography
Yazz Ahmed is a British-Bahraini trumpet and flugelhorn player renowned for her innovative fusion of jazz with Arabic music and electronic sound design. Born in Bahrain to a British mother and Bahraini father, she spent her early childhood immersed in the sounds and culture of the Middle East before moving to London at age nine. Inspired by her maternal grandfather, a jazz trumpeter, Ahmed began playing the trumpet and later studied music at Kingston University, followed by jazz studies at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama[3][4].

Ahmed's career is marked by a distinctive approach that blends her dual heritage, resulting in what critics describe as 'psychedelic Arabic jazz.' Her debut album, 'Finding My Way Home' (2011), introduced her unique voice, but it was 'La Saboteuse' (2017) that garnered international acclaim, appearing on numerous 'best of' lists and establishing her as a leading figure in contemporary jazz[2]. She has performed at major festivals worldwide and collaborated with a diverse array of artists, including Radiohead, Lee Scratch Perry, and These New Puritans[1][2]. Her 2019 album 'Polyhymnia' further showcased her compositional ambition, celebrating influential women and expanding her reach as both a performer and composer[5].

Ahmed is celebrated for her ability to bridge cultures through music, using her compositions to challenge perceptions and promote inclusivity. Her legacy is that of a trailblazer in nu jazz and fusion, inspiring a new generation of musicians and listeners with her vibrant, genre-defying sound[5][6].
