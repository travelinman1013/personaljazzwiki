## Biography
Wayne Shorter (August 25, 1933 – March 2, 2023) was a pioneering American jazz saxophonist and composer, widely regarded as one of the most influential figures in modern jazz. Born in Newark, New Jersey, Shorter began his musical journey on the clarinet at age 16 before switching to tenor saxophone and studying music education at New York University. After a brief stint with Horace Silver and Maynard Ferguson, his career took off when he joined Art Blakey’s Jazz Messengers in 1959, where he quickly established himself as both a formidable saxophonist and a prolific composer, eventually becoming the group’s music director.

In 1964, Shorter joined Miles Davis’s Second Great Quintet, contributing many compositions that became jazz standards and helping to shape the group’s innovative approach to modal jazz and early fusion. His work with Davis, and later as a co-founder of the fusion supergroup Weather Report with Joe Zawinul, placed him at the forefront of jazz’s evolution through the 1960s and 1970s. Shorter’s style is marked by sophisticated harmonies, adventurous improvisation, and a lyrical, often enigmatic approach to both tenor and soprano saxophone. Over a career spanning more than six decades, he released numerous acclaimed solo albums, collaborated with a wide range of artists across genres, and received 12 Grammy Awards, including a Lifetime Achievement Award.

Shorter’s legacy is defined by his restless creativity and his profound impact on jazz composition and improvisation. His compositions, such as 'Footprints,' 'Nefertiti,' and 'Speak No Evil,' are now jazz standards, and his influence extends to generations of musicians in jazz and beyond. Even in his later years, Shorter remained a creative force, exploring new musical territories with projects like his final studio album 'Emanon' and the opera 'Iphigenia' with Esperanza Spalding.
