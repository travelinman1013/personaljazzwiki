## Biography
The Martinis are an alternative rock band formed in Los Angeles, California, in 1993 by **Pixies** guitarist **Joey Santiago** and his wife, vocalist and songwriter **Linda Mallari**.[1][3] The pair had known each other and written together during the Pixies years, reportedly hanging out, composing songs and, in the process, arriving at both the concept and name for The Martinis while Santiago was still Black Francis’s sharp‑toned foil in the seminal Boston band.[2][6] After the Pixies split in the early 1990s, Santiago and Mallari developed The Martinis as their primary creative outlet, with the duo at the core and various supporting musicians appearing in the studio and live.[3][6]

Musically, The Martinis draw on the angular, idiosyncratic guitar work Santiago pioneered in the Pixies, combining it with Mallari’s melodic, often emotionally direct vocal style.[2][3] Critics have noted echoes of Breeders‑style indie pop and the quiet‑verse/loud‑chorus dynamics that became a 1990s alternative rock hallmark, while Mallari’s lyrics focus on love, heartbreak, introspection and escape.[2] Their song **“Free”** gained wider exposure when it was featured in the 1995 film *Empire Records* and included on the official soundtrack, bringing the duo to a broader alternative audience.[1][3] The band released at least one full‑length album through labels including Cooking Vinyl, Artist Direct and Distracted/BMG, with the 2004 album **_Smitten_** further documenting their mix of off‑kilter guitar textures and hook‑laden songwriting.[1][7] Although not as commercially prominent as Santiago’s work with the Pixies, The Martinis occupy a distinctive niche in 1990s–2000s indie rock as a post‑Pixies project that allowed both members to explore a more intimate, collaborative approach while carrying forward elements of the earlier band’s adventurous guitar‑driven sound.[2][3]

Over time, The Martinis’ legacy has become closely tied to their role in showcasing Joey Santiago outside the shadow of the Pixies and highlighting Linda Mallari’s songwriting voice, contributing to the broader tapestry of Filipino‑American representation in alternative rock.[3][8] Their relatively small but carefully crafted catalog, bolstered by cult recognition of “Free” and the enduring interest in Pixies‑related projects, has kept them a minor but persistent reference point for fans and musicians interested in 1990s indie guitar music and its aftermath.[1][2][3][7]

## Fun Facts
- The idea and name for The Martinis reportedly emerged while Joey Santiago and Linda Mallari were still in the Pixies era, hanging out, writing songs and drinking martinis together during downtime from the band.[6]
- Their track “Free” reached a cult audience after being prominently featured in the 1995 film Empire Records and included on the movie’s official soundtrack album, giving the band exposure beyond indie‑rock circles.[1][3]
- The 2004 album Smitten was described by at least one review as having an unusually long gestation, since Santiago and Mallari had been collaborating since before the Pixies, making some of its material the culmination of years of intermittent work.[2][7]
- Both core members, Joey Santiago and Linda Mallari, are Filipino or Filipino‑American, making The Martinis a notable example of Filipino representation in 1990s–2000s alternative rock.[3][8]
