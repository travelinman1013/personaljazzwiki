## Biography
Ray Price (1921–1990) was a central figure in the evolution of Australian jazz, particularly as a guitarist, director, and business manager of The Port Jackson Jazz Band. Born and raised in Sydney, Australia, Price became involved in the burgeoning jazz scene during the 1940s, a period when jazz was gaining popularity in the country. He joined The Port Jackson Jazz Band in 1947, quickly establishing himself as a driving force behind their success, both musically and organizationally.

Under Price's leadership, The Port Jackson Jazz Band became one of Australia's most prominent traditional jazz ensembles. He played a key role in organizing performances, publicizing the band, and expanding their reach, including high-profile concerts at the NSW Conservatorium of Music in 1948. Price's musical style was rooted in Dixieland and traditional jazz, but he was also known for his adaptability and openness to new influences, which helped the band remain relevant through changing musical eras. His legacy endures as a pioneer who helped lay the foundation for Australia's jazz community, mentoring younger musicians and fostering a vibrant live music culture in Sydney and beyond.
