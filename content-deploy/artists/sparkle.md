## Biography
Sparkle, born Stephanie Edwards on May 13, 1975, in Chicago, Illinois, is an American R&B singer best known for her soulful vocals and her breakout success in the late 1990s. She began her musical journey singing in her family's gospel group, honing her voice in the church before venturing into the professional music world. Sparkle's career took a significant turn in 1989 when she met R. Kelly, who would become her mentor and producer. Under his guidance, she became the first and only artist to release an album on his Rockland label.

Her self-titled debut album, released in 1998, was a commercial success, debuting at No. 3 on the Billboard 200 and No. 2 on the R&B charts, and was quickly certified gold. The album's standout single, "Be Careful," a duet with R. Kelly, became a No. 1 R&B hit and reached No. 7 on the UK singles chart, solidifying her place in late-90s R&B. Despite this early success, creative differences with R. Kelly led Sparkle to leave Rockland/Interscope and sign with Motown Records, where she released her second album, 'Told You So,' in 2000. Sparkle's style blends contemporary R&B with gospel influences, marked by emotionally charged lyrics and powerful vocal delivery. Though her mainstream presence waned after the early 2000s, her work remains influential within the genre.
