## Biography
Khruangbin is a neo-psychedelic band from Houston, Texas, formed by Mark Speer, Laura Lee Ochoa, and DJ Johnson. The band's name, meaning 'airplane' in Thai, reflects their global musical influences. They began by recording in a makeshift studio called 'The Barn' on Speer's family property, aiming to create music before performing live. Their big break came when Bonobo featured their song 'A Calf Born in Winter' on his *LateNightTales* compilation, leading to a record deal and the release of their debut album *The Universe Smiles Upon You* in 2015. Khruangbin's sound blends Thai funk, Middle Eastern rhythms, and Latin influences with soul and rock, making them stand out in today's music scene. 

 Leon Bridges, on the other hand, is a soul singer-songwriter from Fort Worth, Texas. He rose to fame with his debut single 'Coming Home' in 2015, which blended vintage soul with contemporary style. Bridges' music often explores themes of love, heartache, and social justice, drawing inspiration from classic soul and R&B. His career has been marked by collaborations with artists like Macklemore and Ryan Lewis, and he has released several critically acclaimed albums, including *Coming Home* and *Good Thing*. 

 Both Khruangbin and Leon Bridges have contributed significantly to the contemporary music scene by pushing genre boundaries and exploring diverse musical influences.
