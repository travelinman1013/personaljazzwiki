## Biography
Fern Jones was born Celesta Fern Jones in 1923 in El Dorado, Arkansas, into a poor southern family. She taught herself guitar at age twelve and piano soon after, showing an early affinity for music that blended the popular sounds of her day with the deep spirituals of the American South. By age fourteen, she was performing in local honky tonks, and at sixteen, she married Raymond Jones, a preacher. Together, they traveled the southern United States, leading tent revival meetings and performing gospel music, often selling their self-recorded albums from the trunk of their car.

Jones's music career reached its zenith in the late 1950s when she recorded her only professional album, 'Singing a Happy Song,' for Dot Records in Nashville. The album, produced with the help of the Nashville A Team of session musicians, fused country, gospel, and rockabilly, creating a sound that was both contemporary and deeply rooted in tradition. Her powerful, earthy voice drew comparisons to Patsy Cline, but her focus remained on gospel themes. Despite critical acclaim, the album did not achieve commercial success, partly due to disagreements with the label and limited promotion. After relocating to California, Jones retired from performing in 1960, leaving behind a legacy as a pioneering figure in country gospel whose work was rediscovered and celebrated decades later.

Jones is best remembered for her song 'I Was There When It Happened,' which became a gospel standard after being recorded by Jimmie Davis and later Johnny Cash. Her unique blend of white country, black gospel, and rockabilly, as well as her passionate, boundary-crossing performances, have earned her posthumous recognition as a seminal figure at the intersection of gospel and early rock 'n' roll.
