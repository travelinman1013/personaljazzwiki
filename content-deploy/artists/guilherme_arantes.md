## Biography
Guilherme Arantes (born July 28, 1953, in São Paulo, Brazil) is a Brazilian singer-songwriter and pianist who has become one of the most influential figures in Brazilian popular music. As a teenager, he was a member of the band Os Polissonantes, which featured Brazilian actor Kadu Moliterno on bass guitar. In 1969, Arantes co-founded Moto Perpétuo with fellow students from São Paulo University's architecture course, a progressive rock band that blended international rock influences with Brazilian MPB traditions from the Clube da Esquina movement. The band released an album in 1974 on the Continental label, with Arantes composing 9 of the 11 tracks, but he left the group in 1975 to pursue a more personal and emotionally direct pop style.

Arantes' solo career took off immediately when his song "Meu Mundo e Nada Mais" (My World and Nothing More) was selected by Rede Globo for the telenovela *Anjo Mau* in 1976, becoming a major hit and launching his national touring career. His self-titled debut album, released the same year on Globo's Som Livre label, established him as a rising star. Throughout the late 1970s and 1980s, Arantes became a prolific hitmaker, writing 23 additional songs for telenovela soundtracks and achieving remarkable commercial success. During the 1980s, he set a record for collecting the highest royalties among Brazilian songwriters, surpassing Caetano Veloso, Chico Buarque, and Gilberto Gil, and placed 12 songs at number one on the charts. He is credited with pioneering the new wave genre in Brazil with "Perdidos na Selva" in 1981, considered the country's first new wave song.

Beyond his solo achievements, Arantes has been recognized as a master songwriter whose compositions have been recorded by numerous major Brazilian artists including Elis Regina, Maria Bethânia, Caetano Veloso, Roberto Carlos, Gal Costa, and Belchior. He is one of the few Brazilian pianists to be recognized as a Steinway Artist, joining an elite group that includes Franz Liszt, George Gershwin, and Duke Ellington. His 2017 album *Flores & Cores* was ranked the 13th best Brazilian album of that year by *Rolling Stone Brasil*. As of 2021, Arantes has relocated to Ávila, Spain, and is preparing a new album for release in early 2026 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of his career.
