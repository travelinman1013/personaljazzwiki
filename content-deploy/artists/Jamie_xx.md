## Biography
Jamie xx, born James Thomas Smith on October 28, 1988, in London, England, is an acclaimed English musician, DJ, record producer, and remixer. He rose to prominence as a founding member of the indie pop band The xx, which he joined in 2006 alongside school friends Romy Madley Croft, Oliver Sim, and Baria Qureshi from the Elliott School, a London institution known for producing innovative electronic musicians. The xx's debut album, 'xx,' released in 2009, achieved platinum status in the UK and established the group as a defining force in modern indie and electronic music[1][2][3].

Beyond his work with The xx, Jamie xx has built a celebrated solo career distinguished by his innovative approach to electronic music, blending elements of UK garage, house, and experimental pop. His 2015 debut solo album, 'In Colour,' received widespread critical acclaim, earning nominations for the Mercury Prize and the Grammy Award for Best Dance/Electronic Album[2][3]. Jamie xx is also renowned for his remix work, notably his transformative collaboration with Gil Scott-Heron on the album 'We're New Here' (2011), and for producing tracks for major artists such as Drake, Radiohead, and Alicia Keys. His influence extends into ballet, having composed the score for 'Tree of Codes' in 2015, further showcasing his versatility and impact on contemporary music[2][3].

Jamie xx's legacy is marked by his ability to bridge the worlds of indie, dance, and pop music, both as a solo artist and as a key creative force within The xx. His introspective, bass-driven production style and his reserved public persona have made him a unique figure in the global music scene, inspiring a new generation of musicians to experiment with genre boundaries and emotional depth in electronic music[3][4].
