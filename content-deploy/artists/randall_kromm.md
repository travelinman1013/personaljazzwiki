## Biography
Randall Kromm is a Boston-based singer-songwriter known for his finely crafted, heartfelt songs about the experiences of ordinary life. Raised in Manhattan, Kansas, Kromm grew up listening to the Kingston Trio, Joan Baez, and the Beatles, influences that would later shape his musical sensibility. After attending Williams College in Massachusetts, he moved to Boston, where he balanced work as a grant writer and union organizer with performing in rock bands. Kromm later shifted his career to law and public policy at Harvard University, but music remained a constant passion.

In 2009, Kromm reinvented himself as a folksinger, quickly gaining recognition in the Boston folk scene. He has since released five albums, including 'Water Wheel' (2011), 'Holidays and Homecomings' (2011), 'Time Won’t Let Us Stay' (2014), 'Rough and Polished Stones' (2017), and 'Late September' (2023). His songwriting is celebrated for its warmth, wit, and insight, focusing on themes of family, relationships, and the passage of time. Kromm's performances often feature his daughters, Emma and Grace, whose harmonies add a familial depth to his live shows. His work has been praised by notable figures such as Christine Lavin and Don White, and he has performed at prestigious venues like Club Passim, earning a reputation as a masterful storyteller and performer.
