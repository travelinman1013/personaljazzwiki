## Biography
David Warren Brubeck was born on December 6, 1920, in Concord, California, into a musical family; his mother, a classical pianist, began teaching him piano at age four. Raised on a cattle ranch in the Sierra Nevada foothills, Brubeck's early life was shaped by both rural labor and music. He initially studied veterinary medicine at the College of the Pacific but switched to music after being drawn to jazz through playing in local nightclubs. After serving in the U.S. Army during World War II, where he led one of the first racially integrated bands, Brubeck studied composition at Mills College under Darius Milhaud, who encouraged him to blend jazz and classical elements. This led to the formation of the Dave Brubeck Octet and, later, the legendary Dave Brubeck Quartet with saxophonist Paul Desmond.

Brubeck became a leading figure in cool jazz, known for his innovative use of odd time signatures, polyrhythms, and polytonality. His 1959 album 'Time Out' was a landmark, featuring hits like 'Take Five' and 'Blue Rondo à la Turk,' and became the first jazz album to sell over a million copies. Brubeck's career spanned over six decades, during which he was celebrated for his genre-blending compositions and performances, earning accolades such as induction into the American Classical Music Hall of Fame and a Living Legacy Jazz Award. He remained active as a composer and performer until his death on December 5, 2012, leaving a legacy as one of the most influential jazz musicians of the 20th century.
