## Biography
Linford Kennedy Amankwaa, known professionally as Ko-Jo Cue, was born on May 27, 1989, in Kumasi, Ashanti Region, Ghana. Raised by his grandmother and aunts after his teenage parents could not care for him, he discovered his passion for music at age 9 when his cousin Rebel introduced him to Obrafour's debut album *Pae Mu Ka*, prompting him to memorize lyrics and eventually write his own rhymes as an escape from his surroundings. He attended Kumasi Anglican High School, alma mater to notable musicians like Okyeame Kwame, where he began recording with friend Macfancy in a bedroom studio, leading to early online buzz and a deal with Primitive Music.[1][4]

Ko-Jo Cue's career took off in 2010 with the 'Growing Pains' mixtape series—*N.A.T.H.A.N*, *N.O.N.A*, and *Now And Forever*—earning regional recognition and viral hits like 'Head Nod'. Projects like *Before We Shine* (2011) and its sequel solidified his underground status, with tracks such as 'My Life', 'E No Be Say', and 'Winning' gaining radio play and media coverage. In 2014, he joined Accra-based label BBnZ Live, releasing the critically acclaimed *The Shining* mixtape, praised by artists like M.anifest, and hits like 'Low Key' with E.L and 'Lavender' in 2015. His style blends Ghanaian hip-hop, afropop, hiplife, and highlife, often emphasizing social values and personal struggles.[1][2]

Ko-Jo Cue's legacy includes pioneering mixtapes from Kumasi in Ghana's hip-hop scene, with his debut album *For My Brothers* addressing young African men's challenges, cementing his influence in genres like asakaa, azonto, and afrobeats. His work has garnered national radio rotation, TV features, and a Spotify popularity score of 40.[1][5]
