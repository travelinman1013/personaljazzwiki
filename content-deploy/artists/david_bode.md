## Biography
David Bode is a New Orleans-born saxophonist, composer, arranger, and educator whose career embodies the vibrant musical traditions of his hometown. Captivated by the rhythms of Mardi Gras parades as a child, Bode began his musical journey on clarinet in elementary school before discovering his lifelong passion for the saxophone. He pursued formal studies at Loyola University New Orleans and the University of New Orleans, learning from some of the city’s most respected jazz educators. Bode’s musical upbringing was shaped by the eclectic sounds of New Orleans, from street parades and funk to classical and R&B, as well as the city’s storied jazz heritage.

After university, Bode broadened his horizons by living and performing abroad in China and St. Lucia, experiences that deepened his appreciation for the unique sounds of New Orleans. Upon returning home in 2012, he immersed himself in the local scene, performing with groups such as One Love Brass Band, Doombalaya, and the New Leviathan Oriental Foxtrot Orchestra. In 2025, Bode released his debut album as a leader, 'Good Hang,' a dynamic big band recording that blends modern jazz, classic standards, pop, rock, and original compositions. The album, recorded at the historic Marigny Studios, stands as a testament to Bode’s commitment to both honoring and expanding the New Orleans jazz tradition.

Bode’s style is marked by a forward-looking approach to big band jazz, incorporating global influences and a kaleidoscopic sense of genre. His work as a performer, arranger, and educator has made him a respected figure in the New Orleans music community, and his dedication to the city’s musical legacy is evident in both his recordings and his collaborations with a wide range of ensembles.
