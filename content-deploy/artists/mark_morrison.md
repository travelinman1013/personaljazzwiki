## Biography
Mark Anthony Joseph Morrison, born on 12 May 1974, is a British R&B singer who rose to fame with his 1996 platinum hit 'Return of the Mack.' Growing up in Leicester, England, after time in Germany, Morrison faced early legal troubles, including a 1995 prison stint for involvement in a nightclub brawl that resulted in a student's death; during incarceration, he committed to music and wrote his breakthrough song. His career began with the 1993 vinyl 'Where Is Our Love' on his own Joe'Mel label, followed by 1995 singles 'Crazy' (UK Top 20) and 'Let's Get Down' (Top 40), leading to the massive success of 'Return of the Mack,' which topped the UK Singles Chart for two weeks and peaked at No. 2 on the US Billboard Hot 100, staying on charts for 40 weeks.[1][2][4]

Morrison's debut album, *Return of the Mack* (1996), reached No. 4 in the UK, sold 3 million copies worldwide, and spawned five UK Top 10 singles ('Crazy,' 'Trippin',' 'Horny,' 'Moan & Groan,' and the title track), making him the first British pop artist to achieve this from a debut album. Despite legal issues, including 1997 imprisonment, he earned four Brit Award nominations, a Mercury Prize nod, five MOBO Awards nominations, and performed at the 1997 Brit Awards. Later releases included the 1997 EP *Only God Can Judge Me*, 1999's 'Best Friend' (featuring Conner Reeves and Gabrielle, UK No. 23), and a historic 2000 deal with Death Row Records as the only European artist signed there; he later joined 2 Wikid in 2003 and released *An Innocent Man* in 2006 with DMX.[1][2][3][4]

Known for his smooth R&B style blending club favorites with emotional ballads, Morrison's legacy endures through 'Return of the Mack's' enduring popularity and his pioneering status as the first solo black British artist to top the UK Singles Chart since the 1990s. Though subsequent releases underperformed, his mid-90s impact solidified him as a key figure in British R&B, with Spotify popularity at 64 today.[1][5][6]
