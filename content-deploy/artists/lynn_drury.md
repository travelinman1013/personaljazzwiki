## Biography
Lynn Drury is a Mississippi-born singer-songwriter who has become a fixture in the New Orleans music scene, renowned for her distinctive blend of Americana, country, folk, and the rhythmic grooves of her adopted city. Raised in Carriere, Mississippi after being born in Yazoo City, Drury's early life was steeped in rural traditions, even winning a 4-H state competition in pole bending at age five—a testament to her determined spirit[1][2]. She picked up the guitar at 26 and quickly immersed herself in songwriting, drawing inspiration from her Southern roots and the vibrant culture of New Orleans, where she relocated in the late 1990s[1][2][5].

Drury's music, which she dubs "NOLAmericana," captures the soulful intersection of Mississippi country, New Orleans R&B, and American folk, resulting in a style that is both sultry and gritty[1][6]. Over more than two decades, she has released a string of acclaimed albums, including "Crossing Frequencies" (2001), "Blackberry Winter" (2002), "Sugar on the Floor" (2011), and "High Tide" (2024), collaborating with notable producers and musicians along the way[1]. Her evocative songwriting and distinctive voice have earned her regular spots at major festivals like the French Quarter Fest and New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, as well as accolades such as Offbeat Magazine's Best Country Folk Singer/Songwriter[1][4].

Today, Drury is celebrated for her honest, soul-baring lyrics and her ability to channel both strength and vulnerability through her music. Her legacy is that of a pioneering female artist who has helped define the sound of modern New Orleans Americana, inspiring audiences and fellow musicians with her authenticity and resilience[1][4][7].
