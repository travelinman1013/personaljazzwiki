## Biography
SAILORR, born Kayla Le on December 7, 1998, in Jacksonville, Florida, is a rising Vietnamese-American alt-R&B artist known for her emotive vocals, vivid storytelling, and genre-blending sound. Raised by immigrant parents, SAILORR’s early life was shaped by both her cultural heritage and the challenges of growing up in a subculture that demanded resilience. Initially drawn to musical theater and aspiring to perform on Broadway, she ultimately shifted her focus to music production after realizing her true passion lay in creating her own art. She began experimenting with beats using a Roland SP-404 and built her early reputation by sharing indie R&B demos and DJ mixes on SoundCloud under the name Sailor Goon, a nod to her love for the anime 'Sailor Moon'. Her breakthrough came in 2024 with the viral single 'Pookie’s Requiem,' which became a TikTok sensation and earned a remix featuring Summer Walker, propelling her into the national spotlight. SAILORR’s debut mixtape, 'From Florida’s Finest,' released in May 2025, was praised for its lyrical honesty and sonic vulnerability, earning her recognition as R&B Rookie of the Month and a spot on Billboard’s '50 Best Albums of 2025 So Far.'

SAILORR’s musical style fuses alternative R&B, soul, hip-hop, and dream pop, drawing inspiration from '90s R&B and contemporary influences. Her sound is characterized by floating, buttery vocals and a willingness to explore both gritty and soft emotional landscapes, often delving into themes of identity, relationships, and self-discovery. She has become known for her unapologetic vulnerability and refusal to be confined to a single genre, making her a distinctive voice in the current music scene. Her journey from odd jobs and local open mics to headlining her own tour reflects her determination and authenticity, solidifying her legacy as an artist who turns personal challenges into resonant art.
