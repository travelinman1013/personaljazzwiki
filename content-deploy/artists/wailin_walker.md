## Biography
Al “Wailin’” Walker is a Canadian blues guitarist, singer, songwriter, and bandleader best known as the driving force behind the Wailin’ Walker Band. Born and raised in East Vancouver, British Columbia, he grew up in a rough neighborhood environment and played his first hall gig in East Vancouver in 1974 at just 15 years old, quickly earning a local reputation for fiery electric guitar work and high‑energy live shows.[5] Over the next decades he honed a distinctive brand of Rockin’ Rhythm and Blues, blending traditional Chicago and Texas blues vocabulary with blues‑rock intensity, soulful vocals and dance‑floor‑ready grooves that made him a staple of the Pacific Northwest scene and beyond.[1][2]

Walker’s recording career began in 1978 with his band The Houserockers, marking the start of a steady output of self‑produced blues albums under his own name and with the Wailin’ Walker Band.[1] His discography includes releases such as *The Devil Made Me Play It*, *Buzzsaw Boogie*, *Crazy at Night*, *No Regrets*, *All Fired Up* and, more recently, *Blues Lightnin’*.[1] *The Devil Made Me Play It* (released on Double Trouble Records in Amsterdam) reached the top of blues charts in the Netherlands, Spain and Australia, while *No Regrets* and *All Fired Up* both achieved top positions on blues charts in the United States.[1] His 2025 release *Blues Lightnin’* debuted as the number‑one blues album in Canada, and he has also reached #2 and #1 on the Roots Music charts in 2014–2015 and 2024–2025 respectively, underscoring his enduring relevance after more than five decades in music.[1]

On stage, Walker is celebrated for “stunning electric guitar solos and commanding vocals” that power a hard‑driving electric blues and blues‑rock sound, often uptempo and steeped in classic rhythm‑and‑blues tradition.[1][4][7] Over the years he has led house bands at major venues, served as bandleader for the Wailin’ Walker Band, and worked extensively as a sideman, including a long tenure with the Jerry Doucette Band from 2006 to 2018.[1] Beyond performance, he has contributed as a songwriter for artists such as Long John Baldry and Powder Blues, further cementing his role in the Canadian blues ecosystem.[1] After more than 50 years of playing, recording, and touring, Walker is widely regarded in British Columbia and among blues aficionados as a seasoned blues master whose work bridges traditional electric blues and modern blues‑rock for contemporary audiences.[1][5][7]
