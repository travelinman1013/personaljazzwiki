## Biography
Hartzell Strathdene "Tiny" Parham (February 25, 1900 – April 4, 1943) was a Canadian-born American jazz bandleader and pianist of African-American descent, renowned for his contributions to the ragtime and early jazz scenes. Born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Parham moved to Kansas City, Missouri, as a child, where he studied piano under the influential ragtime composer James Scott. He began his career performing in vaudeville theaters and developed a reputation as a versatile musician, touring throughout North America and the Caribbean before settling in Chicago in the mid-1920s.[1][4]

In Chicago, Parham became a prominent figure, working as an arranger, talent scout, and bandleader. He recorded extensively for the Victor Talking Machine Company between 1927 and 1930, both as an accompanist for notable blues artists and with his own ensemble, Tiny Parham and His Musicians. His musical style blended sophisticated jazz arrangements with ragtime influences, often featuring violin solos and a distinctive use of tuba, horns, and reeds. Parham's compositions were noted for their originality and exotic flair, drawing comparisons to Jelly Roll Morton and Duke Ellington. After Victor ended his contract in 1930, Parham continued performing in theaters and made his final recordings in 1940 before his untimely death in Milwaukee in 1943.[1][4][5]

Although Parham never achieved widespread fame, his recordings are highly prized among jazz collectors and historians. His innovative approach and unique orchestration left a lasting mark on the development of early jazz, and his legacy endures through reissues and tributes, including a feature in R. Crumb’s "Early Jazz Greats" trading card collection.[1][5]
