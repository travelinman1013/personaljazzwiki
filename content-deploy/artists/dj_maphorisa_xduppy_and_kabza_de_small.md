## Biography
DJ Maphorisa (Themba Sonnyboy Sekowe), born November 15, 1987, in Soshanguve, Pretoria, South Africa, is a pioneering DJ, producer, and songwriter whose career has profoundly shaped the soundscape of modern South African music. Raised in a musically rich environment—his mother was a gospel singer—Maphorisa was exposed to diverse genres from an early age, which later informed his eclectic production style. His professional journey began as a member of the group Uhuru, where he contributed to major hits like 'Y-Tjukutja' and 'Khona,' blending traditional African rhythms with contemporary beats and earning national recognition.[4]

Maphorisa's solo career soared as he became a central figure in the rise of amapiano, a genre characterized by deep basslines, melodic piano riffs, and percussive rhythms. He has released numerous acclaimed albums, including 'Scorpion Kings' with Kabza De Small, 'I Am the King of Amapiano,' and 'Gqom Is the Future.' His work has not only dominated South African charts but also achieved international acclaim, notably co-producing Drake's global hit 'One Dance.' Maphorisa's collaborations span a wide spectrum of artists, including Wizkid, Major Lazer, and Black Coffee, and his entrepreneurial spirit led him to found BlaqBoy Music, a label fostering new talent and innovation in the industry.[4][1][2]

Kabza De Small (Kabelo Motha), often called the 'King of Amapiano,' is a frequent collaborator and creative partner. Together, their 'Scorpion Kings' projects have become synonymous with the genre's global rise. Xduppy is a newer-generation producer and DJ closely associated with both Maphorisa and Kabza De Small, contributing to the evolving sound of amapiano through collaborative tracks and live performances. Collectively, these artists have not only popularized amapiano but also influenced the broader African and global music scenes through their innovation, mentorship, and cross-genre experimentation.[2][5][4]
