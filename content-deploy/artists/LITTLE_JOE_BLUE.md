## Biography
Little Joe Blue, born Joseph Valery Jr. on September 23, 1934, in Vicksburg, Mississippi, was an American electric blues singer and guitarist who became known for his soulful vocal style and guitar work. Raised in Tallulah, Louisiana, across the river from his birthplace, he spent his first seventeen years working in agriculture and at the local fish market before moving to Detroit in 1951, where he found employment at the Lincoln-Mercury plant in Wayne. His musical journey began during this period, though it was interrupted by military service when he volunteered for the U.S. Army in 1953, spending three years including time in Korea.

After returning from military service, Blue settled back in Detroit and worked at the Ford plant while developing his musical career through talent shows and performances at small clubs and bars. His personal life led him through various relocations - first to Reno, Nevada, to be near his sisters, then to Los Angeles in 1961 to live with his aunt, where he worked construction and demolition jobs while performing in local clubs at nights and weekends. In 1977, after a period in Kansas City, Missouri, he established his base in Dallas and performed regularly throughout Texas before eventually returning to Reno, where he died of stomach cancer on April 22, 1990.

Musically, Little Joe Blue was often compared to B.B. King, though this comparison was considered somewhat unfair as he maintained his own distinctive style throughout his career. He was described as a journeyman blues singer who successfully maintained a full-time music career for over thirty years by consistently delivering the kind of performances his African-American audience wanted. His integrity as an artist was notable - he never compromised his basic blues style to win a wider audience, resulting in work that maintained authenticity throughout his career. He was known for his ability to find and record good songs, and his legacy was preserved in 'The Very Best of Little Joe Blue,' a collection released in 1996.

## Fun Facts
- He was known as a journeyman blues singer who traveled everywhere by Greyhound bus and frequently used pick-up bands for his performances
- Despite being often described as a B.B. King imitator, music critics noted that his records showed he was a fine singer with his own distinctive approach
- He successfully maintained a full-time music career for over thirty years without ever compromising his basic blues style to appeal to mainstream audiences
- His final years were spent in Reno, Nevada, where he had previously lived to be close to his sisters, creating a full-circle return to a place that had been important in his life
