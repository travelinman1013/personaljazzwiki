## Biography
Cleo Sol, born Cleopatra Zvezdana Nikolic on March 24, 1990, in Ladbroke Grove, West London, is an acclaimed English singer-songwriter whose artistry bridges neo soul, alternative R&B, and UK R&B. Raised in a musically rich household—her mother is Serbian-Spanish and her father Jamaican, both jazz musicians—she absorbed influences ranging from jazz and reggae to Motown and Latin music. Cleo began songwriting and performing as a teenager, sharing her early work on MySpace and collaborating with UK producers like DaVinChe, which led to features with artists such as Tinie Tempah, Skepta, and Wretch 32. Her initial singles, including the reggae-infused 'High' (2011) and Motown-inspired 'Never the Right Time (Who Do You Love)' (2012), established her as a notable figure in the UK underground music scene.[1][3]

After a brief hiatus, Cleo Sol re-emerged in 2018 with her debut EP 'Winter Songs', followed by a series of critically acclaimed albums: 'Rose in the Dark' (2020), 'Mother' (2021), and the surprise releases 'Heaven' and 'Gold' (2023). Her music is characterized by its soulful, introspective lyricism and a warm, mellifluous vocal style that draws from the traditions of Lauryn Hill, Erykah Badu, Jill Scott, and Stevie Wonder. Cleo's work explores themes of love, identity, faith, and self-discovery, resonating deeply with audiences and critics alike. She is also the lead vocalist for the enigmatic collective SAULT, known for their genre-blending sound and aversion to public appearances.[1][2][3][6]

Cleo Sol's legacy is marked by her ability to blend personal vulnerability with musical sophistication, earning her accolades such as a MOBO Award for Best R&B Act and a BRIT Award nomination. Her influence extends beyond her solo career, as she continues to shape the sound of contemporary British soul and R&B through her collaborations and mentorship within the SAULT collective. Despite her growing international profile, Cleo remains a supremely private artist, rarely performing live and letting her music speak for itself.[1][3][4]
