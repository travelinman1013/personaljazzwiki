## Biography
Roy Hargrove (1969–2018) was a Grammy-winning American jazz trumpeter renowned for his versatility and innovation across genres. Born in Waco, Texas, and raised in Dallas, he began playing trumpet in elementary school and attended the Booker T. Washington High School for the Performing and Visual Arts, a renowned incubator for musical talent. Hargrove's prodigious skills were recognized early when Wynton Marsalis discovered him during a high school clinic, inviting the teenager to perform with jazz greats such as Dizzy Gillespie and Herbie Hancock. 

Hargrove briefly attended Berklee College of Music before moving to New York City, where he immersed himself in the jazz scene and released his debut album, 'Diamond in the Rough,' in 1990. Throughout the 1990s, he became a leading figure in straight-ahead jazz, recording acclaimed albums and collaborating with both peers and legends. In the 2000s, Hargrove expanded his musical horizons, forming the RH Factor to explore the intersections of jazz, hip-hop, soul, and funk, and working with artists like D’Angelo, Erykah Badu, and Common. He also led his own quintet and big band, earning two Grammy Awards—one for the Afro-Cuban project 'Habana' and another for 'Directions in Music' with Herbie Hancock and Michael Brecker.

Hargrove’s musical style was deeply rooted in jazz tradition but constantly evolving, marked by lyrical improvisation, technical brilliance, and openness to new sounds. His influence is evident in the current generation of jazz and genre-blending musicians, and his compositions—especially 'Strasbourg/St. Denis'—have become modern standards. Hargrove’s legacy endures through his recordings, mentorship, and the many artists he inspired.
