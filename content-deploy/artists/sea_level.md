## Biography
Sea Level was an American Southern rock, jazz fusion, and funk band formed in Macon, Georgia, in 1976 as an offshoot of the Allman Brothers Band. Originally known as the trio 'We Three'—consisting of pianist/keyboardist/vocalist Chuck Leavell, bassist Lamar Williams, and drummer Jaimoe (Jai Johanny Johanson)—the group began opening shows for the Allmans in 1975-1976 amid the parent band's internal tensions and eventual breakup. After Gregg Allman and Dickey Betts departed, the trio added guitarist Jimmy Nalls, adopting the name Sea Level as a phonetic pun on Leavell's surname ('C. Leavell'), and signed with Capricorn Records to release their self-titled debut album in 1977, blending jazz, blues, rock, and funk in extended jam-oriented tracks.[1][2][5][6]

The band expanded into a larger ensemble for subsequent releases, incorporating guitarist Davis Causey, saxophonist/keyboardist/vocalist Randall Bramblett, and others like drummer George Weaver, evolving their sound toward yacht rock influences with hits like 'That's Your Secret' reaching #50 on the Billboard Hot 100 from the 1978 album Cats on the Coast. Lineup changes continued, with Jaimoe and Weaver departing before On the Edge (1978), Joe English joining for Long Walk on a Short Pier (1979), and Matt Greeley for their final Arista album Ball Room (1980). Despite relentless touring and five albums, shifting tastes away from Southern rock led to commercial struggles, culminating in the band's dissolution by 1981.[1][2][3]

Sea Level's legacy endures through its members' later careers, particularly Leavell, who became a renowned session musician and touring keyboardist with Eric Clapton and the Rolling Stones, occasionally revisiting Sea Level material in solo work like Forever Blue and Southscape. The band is remembered as a proficient 'jam band' precursor, emphasizing crisp musicianship and genre fusion, with a greatest hits compilation preserving their output alongside Southern rock compilations.[1][3]
