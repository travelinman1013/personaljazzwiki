## Biography
Ebo Taylor, born in 1936 in Saltpond near Cape Coast in Ghana’s Central Region, is a pioneering guitarist, composer, arranger, and bandleader whose career has spanned over six decades. Taylor’s musical journey began in the 1950s as the lead guitarist and arranger for the Stargazers Band and the Broadway Dance Band, two of the most influential highlife groups of the era. His early compositions, such as 'Sika Enibre' and 'Owu Na Mewu,' became staples of Ghanaian popular music.

In 1962, Taylor moved to London to study at the Eric Gilder School of Music, where he immersed himself in jazz, funk, and soul, and collaborated with other African musicians, including a young Fela Kuti. Returning to Ghana in the mid-1960s, Taylor continued to innovate, leading the Uhuru Dance Band and later forming the Apagya Show Band, which became known for its fusion of highlife, afrobeat, jazz, and funk. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Taylor worked as a prolific arranger and producer for major Ghanaian record labels, shaping the careers of artists like Pat Thomas and C.K. Mann while also releasing his own influential solo albums, including 'Twer Nyame' and 'Ebo Taylor & the Pelikans.'

Taylor’s legacy is defined by his ability to blend traditional Ghanaian rhythms with contemporary styles, creating a distinctive sound that has influenced generations of musicians. After a period of relative obscurity, his work was rediscovered in the 2000s, leading to renewed international recognition and a series of acclaimed releases, such as 'Love and Death' (2010) and 'Appia Kwa Bridge.' Taylor has also contributed to music education, teaching highlife and jazz guitar at the University of Ghana, and remains a vital figure in the global appreciation of African music.
