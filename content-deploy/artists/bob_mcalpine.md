## Biography
Bob McAlpine is a Canadian guitarist, composer, and educator based in Toronto, Ontario, known for his versatility across rock, jazz, pop, and theater work.[1][4][5] Active on the Toronto scene for many years, he has built a reputation as an in‑demand session and live player, contributing to concerts, tours, and studio projects while also developing a parallel career as a respected guitar teacher and arranger.[1][4][5] His work includes both original compositions and sophisticated arrangements of classic rock material, often presented in a solo fingerstyle context.[1][5]

McAlpine has performed with a wide range of artists and ensembles, including tribute acts dedicated to Steely Dan and Chicago, where his detailed command of harmony and groove is central to recreating those bands’ complex guitar parts.[1][4][5] His own recordings and published guitar tabs showcase a style that blends classic rock, jazz fusion, blues, and pop, with an emphasis on melodic soloing, tight rhythm work, and harmonically rich chord voicings.[1][3][5] In addition to live and studio playing, he produces educational materials and teaches privately, passing on practical, gig‑tested approaches to improvisation, reading, and arranging to a new generation of guitarists.[1][3][5]

Over time, McAlpine’s legacy has become closely tied to his reliability as a “go‑to” guitarist in Toronto—someone bandleaders and producers call when they need precise parts learned quickly and executed at a high level.[4][5] His online presence, including performance videos and downloadable tabs, has extended his reach beyond Canada, influencing guitarists who study his arrangements of classic rock solos and his original pieces.[1][3][5] Though not a mainstream household name, within professional circles he is recognized as a consummate sideman, a stylistically flexible player, and a skilled interpreter of sophisticated rock and jazz‑influenced repertoire.[1][4][5]
