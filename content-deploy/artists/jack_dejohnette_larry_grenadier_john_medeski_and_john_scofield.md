## Biography
Hudson is a jazz supergroup formed by four acclaimed musicians: drummer Jack DeJohnette, bassist Larry Grenadier, keyboardist John Medeski, and guitarist John Scofield. Each member boasts a storied career across jazz and related genres, but they united over a shared love for the Hudson River Valley, which they all call home. Their collaboration began at the Woodstock Jazz Festival in 2014, where their immediate chemistry led to the formation of the group and the release of their self-titled debut album, 'Hudson,' in 2017. The album blends original compositions with inventive renditions of songs by Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, Jimi Hendrix, and The Band, capturing both the spirit of the region and the group's collective musical vision.[1][2][3][4]

The group's music is marked by adventurous improvisation, genre-blurring interplay, and a deep sense of place. DeJohnette, the senior member and a NEA Jazz Master, brings a legacy of innovation from his work with Miles Davis and Keith Jarrett. Scofield, a Grammy-winning guitarist, is known for his soulful jazz and R&B sensibilities. Medeski, famed for his work with Medeski Martin & Wood, contributes a vibrant, groove-oriented keyboard style, while Grenadier, a sought-after bassist, anchors the ensemble with his lyrical approach. Together, they create a sound that is both rooted in jazz tradition and open to the influences of rock, folk, and the countercultural legacy of the Hudson Valley.[1][2][3]

Hudson stands as a testament to the enduring vitality of collaborative jazz, drawing on the members' individual histories and their shared commitment to creative exploration. Their work has been celebrated for its dynamic interplay, reverence for musical heritage, and the unique energy derived from their upstate New York surroundings.[1][2][3][4]
