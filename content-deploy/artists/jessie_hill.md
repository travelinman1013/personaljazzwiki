## Biography
Jessie Hill, also known as Jessie Hillel and JHM, is a New Zealand-born singer, songwriter, and producer whose career has spanned both her home country and Australia. She first gained national attention as the runner-up on the second series of New Zealand's Got Talent, showcasing her powerful vocals and versatility across genres. As a child, Hill performed in local shows and television contests, including appearances on New Zealand TV2's 'What Now' and TV1's 'Find A Star,' where she sang classical and contemporary pieces.

After her early success, Hill continued to develop her career, moving to Melbourne, Australia, where she won the inaugural Fed Live music competition at Federation Square, an event supported by MTV Australia and Mushroom Records. She has released a number of singles and EPs under her own name and as part of the pop band JHM, blending elements of classical, pop, hip hop, and orchestral music. Notable releases include the album 'With Love' (2013), the single 'Santorini' (2021), and her 2024 collaboration 'From this moment' with DJ Noiz, which reached #14 on the NZ Top 20 Hot Singles chart. Hill's style is marked by a fusion of genres, strong melodic sensibilities, and a willingness to experiment with new sounds.

Her legacy is still emerging, but Hill is recognized for her ability to bridge classical training with contemporary pop and reggae influences, contributing to the evolving soundscape of New Zealand and Australasian music. Her work continues to inspire young artists, particularly those from multicultural backgrounds, to pursue diverse musical paths.
