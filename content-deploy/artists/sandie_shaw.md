## Biography
Sandie Shaw, born Sandra Ann Goodrich on February 26, 1947 in Dagenham, London, emerged as one of the most successful British pop singers of the 1960s and a defining icon of the 'Swinging Sixties.' Raised in a working-class family, she worked at the Ford Dagenham automotive factory and modeled part-time before being discovered at age 16 by singer Adam Faith, who introduced her to manager Eve Taylor. Signing with Pye Records in 1964, Shaw quickly rose to fame with her chart-topping cover of '(There's) Always Something There to Remind Me,' written by Burt Bacharach and Hal David, making her an international star at just 17 years old.

Shaw's career flourished with a string of hits, many penned by songwriter Chris Andrews, including 'Girl Don't Come,' 'Long Live Love,' and 'I'll Stop At Nothing.' Her signature barefoot performances and distinctive style made her a fashion trendsetter. In 1967, she achieved global recognition as the first British artist to win the Eurovision Song Contest with 'Puppet on a String,' which became a massive international hit. Throughout the late 1960s, Shaw released several albums, hosted her own BBC television show, and even launched her own fashion label. Despite a decline in chart success in the 1970s, she enjoyed a resurgence in the 1980s, notably collaborating with The Smiths on 'Hand in Glove.'

Beyond music, Shaw became a qualified psychotherapist in the 1990s, founding the Arts Clinic to support psychological health in the entertainment industry. Her legacy endures as a pioneering female pop star, fashion icon, and influential figure whose music and image inspired generations of artists and Eurovision contestants.
