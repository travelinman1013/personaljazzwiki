## Biography
Courtney Melba Barnett was born in Sydney, Australia, on 3 November 1987, and given her middle name after the famous opera singer Nellie Melba[1]. She grew up in Sydney's Northern Beaches in a musically rich household with a ballet-dancer mother and artist father, where she was exposed to jazz and classical music[3]. At age 10, she began playing guitar, initially learning Nirvana songs[3]. When she was 16, her family relocated to Hobart, Tasmania, where she attended St Michael's Collegiate School and the Tasmanian School of Art[1]. Inspired by Australian singer-songwriters Darren Hanlon and Dan Kelly, she began writing her own songs[1].

After moving to Melbourne at age 20 to pursue music full-time, Barnett worked various jobs including pizza delivery and bartending while collaborating with local musicians[3]. Between 2010 and 2013, she played in several bands including the post-grunge outfit Rapid Transit, the Olivettes, and the country-psych band Immigrant Union, where she played slide guitar and shared vocal duties[1][3]. Her breakthrough came with the release of her debut EP *I've Got a Friend Called Emily Ferris* in 2012 on her own label, Milk! Records, followed by *The Double EP: A Sea of Split Peas* in 2013, which garnered international attention[1]. Her debut album *Sometimes I Sit and Think, and Sometimes I Just Sit* was released in 2015 to widespread critical acclaim, earning her four ARIA Music Awards, a Grammy nomination for Best New Artist, and a Brit Award nomination for International Female Solo Artist[1].

Barnett is renowned for her **deadpan singing style and witty, rambling lyrics** that showcase her skills as both a deft lyricist and virtuosic guitarist[1][7]. Her distinctive musical voice and clever, detailed songwriting have established her as one of Australia's most successful musical exports[7]. She continues to perform and record, often collaborating with her band featuring lead guitarist and keyboardist Dan Luscombe, a configuration she has dubbed "CB3" on social media[2].
