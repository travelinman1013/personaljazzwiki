## Biography
El Gran Combo de Puerto Rico, founded on May 26, 1962, by pianist Rafael Ithier following the breakup of Rafael Cortijo y su Combo, emerged as a pivotal force in salsa music. Ithier, along with original members including Eddie Pérez, Héctor Santos, Kito Vélez, Martín Quiñones, Miguel Cruz, and Roberto Roena, backed Dominican merengue singer Joselito Mateo on the album 'Menéame los mangos,' with the group's name coined by producer Rafael Álvarez Guedes. Their debut album 'Acángana' in 1963 became a number-one hit in New York, Panama, and Puerto Rico, achieving gold status and securing them a spot on the TV show 'El Show de las 12.' Despite lineup changes, such as Chiqui Rivera replaced by Junior 'Andy' Montañez and later Roberto Roena's departure in 1969 to form Apollo Sound, the band thrived under Ithier's musical direction, blending salsa with merengue and timba influences.[1][2][3][5][6][7]

Throughout the 1970s and beyond, El Gran Combo navigated challenges like record label disputes by launching their own EGC Records in 1970, releasing hits like 'El Momo de Oro.' Key shifts included Miguel Cruz's 1975 exit due to health issues, replaced by Fernando Pérez, and Andy Montañez's 1977 departure to La Dimensión Latina, with Jerry Rivas joining to form a lasting vocal duo with Pellín Rodríguez. The group earned international acclaim, performing for 50,000 at Yankee Stadium in 1973 as Fania All-Stars openers, winning awards like the 1976 New Orleans Honorary Award and Venezuela's President's Cup, and receiving a 1984 Grammy nomination for 'Breaking the Ice.' Known as 'La Universidad de la Salsa,' their cadencioso sound, charismatic choreography, and repertoire of humorous, everyday narratives solidified their legacy as Puerto Rico's most successful salsa orchestra.[1][2][3][4][7]

Still active with Ithier as the sole remaining founder, El Gran Combo has influenced Latin music globally, maintaining popularity through decades of evolution while preserving core salsa traditions.
