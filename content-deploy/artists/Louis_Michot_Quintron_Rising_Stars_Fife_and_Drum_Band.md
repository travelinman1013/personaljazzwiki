## Biography
Louis Michot is a renowned Cajun musician from South Louisiana, celebrated for his dynamic role as fiddler and vocalist in the Grammy-winning Lost Bayou Ramblers and as the founder of Michot’s Melody Makers. Born into a musical family, Michot began his journey on the stand-up bass at age 14, performing with Les Freres Michot, a group led by his father and uncles. By age 19, he had picked up the fiddle and, alongside his brother Andre, formed Lost Bayou Ramblers, a band now recognized for revitalizing and innovating traditional Cajun music over two decades[8][6].

Michot’s career is marked by a deep commitment to Louisiana French culture and environmental activism. He has released over twenty albums, blending Cajun, zydeco, and experimental sounds, and has collaborated with a diverse array of artists. His solo debut, 'Rêve du Troubadour' (2023), showcases his multi-instrumental talents and his willingness to fuse Louisiana French traditions with global influences such as hip-hop and electronica. Michot’s music often incorporates field recordings from the Louisiana prairie and reflects his concern for local ecology, notably championing the survival of the Ivory-billed Woodpecker, a cause inspired by his biologist father[7][1].

Throughout his career, Michot has been instrumental in preserving Cajun heritage while pushing its boundaries. His collaborations span genres and continents, featuring artists like Bombino, Leyla McCalla, Quintron, and Shardé Thomas with the Rising Stars Fife and Drum Band. Michot’s legacy lies in his innovative approach to folk traditions, his mentorship of younger musicians, and his advocacy for the cultural and environmental resilience of Louisiana[1][7][8].
