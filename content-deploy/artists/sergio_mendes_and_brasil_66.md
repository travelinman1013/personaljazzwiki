## Biography
Sergio Mendes & Brasil '66 was founded by Brazilian pianist, composer, and bandleader Sergio Mendes, born February 11, 1941, in Niterói, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Mendes began classical piano studies as a child under Carmelita Lago but soon gravitated toward jazz and Brazilian popular music, performing in Rio de Janeiro’s vibrant club scene by the early 1960s. After leading the Brazilian Jazz Sextet and the Sergio Mendes Trio, Mendes relocated to Los Angeles in 1964, seeking broader opportunities following political upheaval in Brazil. There, he formed Brasil '66, blending bossa nova, samba, jazz, and American pop, which quickly found international acclaim[3][4].

The group’s breakthrough came with the album 'Herb Alpert Presents Sergio Mendes & Brasil '66,' featuring the hit 'Mas Que Nada,' the first song sung entirely in Portuguese to chart on the U.S. Billboard Pop chart. Their sophisticated yet accessible sound, marked by Mendes’ piano, lush vocal harmonies, and Brazilian rhythms, produced further hits like 'The Look of Love' and 'The Fool on the Hill.' Throughout the late 1960s and 1970s, Mendes and his ensemble became leading ambassadors of Brazilian music, achieving crossover success in both pop and jazz markets and influencing the global perception of Latin music[1][2].

Mendes’ legacy endures through more than 35 albums, multiple Grammy Awards, and collaborations with artists across genres and generations. His innovative fusion of Brazilian and American styles has inspired countless musicians, and his signature songs remain staples of both jazz and pop repertoires. Mendes continued to record and tour worldwide into the 21st century, further cementing his status as one of Brazil’s most influential musical exports[2][5].
