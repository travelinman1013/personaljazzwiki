## Biography
Zita is a four-piece rock band from **New Orleans, Louisiana**, formed in 2019 around a shared love of classic rock, funk, and blues.[1][6][7] The group consists of **Michael Mullins** (lead vocals, trombone, rhythm guitar), **Bradford Lewis II** (lead guitar), **Dylan Caillouet** (bass), and **Kai Melancon** (drums), and they quickly became a presence on the New Orleans live circuit, performing regularly across the city and throughout the greater southeastern United States.[1][6] Their origins in a city known for its deep musical heritage strongly shape their identity, with the band explicitly “wearing their hometown with pride” and channeling the city’s soul, groove, and improvisatory spirit into a rock band format.[1]

Zita released their **debut album “Hardly Alive” in 2021**, establishing a sound that fused 1970s classic rock energy with New Orleans blues and funk sensibilities.[1] As they continued performing and refining their material, they worked closely with respected New Orleans musicians and mentors, which helped them broaden their stylistic palette and studio approach.[1][5] This development culminated in their sophomore studio album **“Axiom”**, an eight‑track record described as taking “pure rock & roll” on a diverse detour through **soul, funk, blues, psychedelia, punk, and experimentation**, while maintaining a strong grounding in the band’s original rock roots and New Orleans character.[1][5] Featuring notable guest musicians from the broader funk, jam, and New Orleans scenes, “Axiom” is positioned as a statement of the band’s maturation and a deliberate exploration of the crossroads between modern rock and one of the world’s most storied music cities.[1]

Through constant gigging and festival appearances, Zita have built a reputation as a **high‑energy live act** whose shows evoke the vibe of 1970s rock & roll while adding a contemporary local flair.[1][4][6] The presence of trombone—often processed as an “electric trombone” texture—within a hard‑driving rock band lineup further distinguishes their sound and stage presentation, aligning them with New Orleans’ brass traditions while still prioritizing big guitar riffs and classic rock songcraft.[1] Although their long‑term legacy is still emerging, early coverage highlights them as a **rising rock group** translating New Orleans’ eclectic musical DNA into a modern, guitar‑driven context, bridging local roots with broader rock audiences in the American South.[1][4][5]
