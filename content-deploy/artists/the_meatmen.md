## Biography
The Meatmen are an American punk band formed in Lansing, Michigan in 1981, fronted by Tesco Vee (born Robert Vermuellen), who also founded the influential Touch and Go Fanzine. The band originally operated from 1981 to 1997, establishing themselves as one of the most provocative and boundary-pushing acts in the hardcore punk scene. Their debut album, 'We're The Meatmen…and You Suck' (1983), immediately set the tone for their controversial approach to punk rock, combining aggressive musical delivery with deliberately offensive humor and shock value that distinguished them from their contemporaries.

Musically, The Meatmen evolved throughout their career, beginning as standard-issue hardcore punk and progressively incorporating influences from mid-80s speed metal and heavy metal aesthetics. The band became known for their theatrical live performances, elaborate costumes, and provocative stage antics. After disbanding in 1997, The Meatmen reformed in 2008 and have continued to tour and record, maintaining their reputation as one of punk rock's most uncompromising and outrageous acts. The band's lineup has consistently revolved around Tesco Vee's vision, with various musicians joining and departing throughout their history.
