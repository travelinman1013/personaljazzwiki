## Biography
Julius Rodriguez is a multi-instrumentalist, composer, and bandleader born in 1998 in White Plains, New York, to a family of Haitian descent[3][5]. He began his musical journey at age three with piano lessons and was introduced to jazz by his father, who played him records by legends such as John Coltrane, Thelonious Monk, and Duke Ellington[3][5]. Rodriguez's early performance experience came from playing drums, keyboards, and organ at his local church, which helped shape his versatile approach to music[3]. By age eleven, he was performing professionally in New York City's jazz clubs, quickly gaining recognition for his prodigious talent[1][6].

Rodriguez honed his skills at the Manhattan School of Music’s precollege division, Berklee College of Music’s summer program, and the YoungArts Foundation[2][3]. He later attended The Juilliard School, studying piano with Jeremy Manasia, but left in 2018 to tour with rapper A$AP Rocky after catching his attention while playing with Isaiah Barr’s Onyx Collective[2][3][5]. Rodriguez’s career rapidly expanded, leading to collaborations with prominent artists such as Meshell Ndegeocello, Brasstracks, Carmen Lundy, Roy Hargrove, and Wynton Marsalis[3][5]. In 2022, he released his debut solo album, 'Let Sound Tell All,' on Verve Records, showcasing his innovative blend of jazz, R&B, hip-hop, and classical music[2][3][5].

Rodriguez’s musical style is characterized by a fearless fusion of genres, drawing from jazz’s rich history while embracing contemporary influences like Stevie Wonder, the Beatles, Solange, James Blake, and Sampha[2][3]. His work is marked by improvisational dexterity and a commitment to expanding jazz’s boundaries, positioning him as a leading figure among a new generation of artists redefining the genre[2][4].
