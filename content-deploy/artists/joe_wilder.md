## Biography
Joe Wilder (February 22, 1922 – May 9, 2014) was an American jazz trumpeter renowned for his lyrical tone and versatility across jazz, classical, and popular music. Born in Colwyn, Pennsylvania, into a musical family led by his father Curtis, a bassist and bandleader, Wilder's earliest performances were on the radio program 'Parisian Tailor's Colored Kiddies of the Air,' where he played alongside future jazz greats and was occasionally backed by bands led by Duke Ellington and Louis Armstrong. He studied at the Mastbaum School of Music in Philadelphia but, recognizing the limited opportunities for African American classical musicians at the time, he shifted his focus to jazz.

At 19, Wilder joined Les Hite's big band, marking the start of a career that would see him play with many of the era's leading orchestras, including those of Jimmie Lunceford, Dizzy Gillespie, and Count Basie. During World War II, he was one of the first thousand African Americans to serve in the Marines, eventually becoming assistant bandmaster. After the war, he earned a bachelor’s degree in classical trumpet from the Manhattan School of Music and performed with the New York Philharmonic and Symphony of the New World. From the late 1950s through the 1970s, Wilder became a first-call studio musician in New York, working for ABC-TV, playing in Broadway pit orchestras, and recording as both a leader and sideman. His solo albums, such as 'Softly with Feeling' (1956) and 'Jazz from Peter Gunn' (1959), showcased his melodic, swinging approach and technical mastery.

Wilder's musical style was marked by a warm, elegant trumpet sound and an ability to adapt seamlessly to a wide range of musical settings. He was a favored collaborator for vocalists like Billie Holiday, Lena Horne, and Tony Bennett, and contributed to countless recordings and performances with jazz luminaries such as Benny Goodman, Gil Evans, and Hank Jones. Wilder’s legacy endures as a pioneering African American musician who bridged jazz and classical traditions, broke racial barriers in the music industry, and inspired generations of trumpeters with his artistry and professionalism.
