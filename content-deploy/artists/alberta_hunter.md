## Biography
Alberta Hunter (April 1, 1895 – October 17, 1984) was a pioneering American jazz and blues singer and songwriter whose career spanned over six decades. Born in Memphis, Tennessee, to a working-class family, Hunter endured a difficult childhood marked by poverty and the absence of her father. Determined to escape her circumstances, she moved to Chicago as a young teenager, where she initially worked menial jobs before breaking into the city's vibrant club scene. By 1911, she was performing at Dago Frank's, a South Side bordello, and soon after, her talent was recognized by influential musicians such as pianist Tony Jackson, who became an early mentor. 

Hunter's career flourished as she became a fixture at Chicago's Dreamland Café, performing alongside King Oliver's Creole Jazz Band and befriending artists like Lil Hardin and Louis Armstrong. In the early 1920s, she moved to New York, began recording with Fletcher Henderson, and wrote the classic "Down Hearted Blues," which became Bessie Smith's breakout hit. Hunter was among the first Black singers to record with a white band and achieved international fame, touring Europe extensively and starring in musical revues. After retiring from music in the 1950s to work as a nurse, she made a remarkable comeback in 1977, captivating new audiences with her powerful voice and storytelling until her death in 1984. Her legacy endures as a trailblazer for women and Black artists in jazz and blues, and as a songwriter whose work helped define the classic blues era.
