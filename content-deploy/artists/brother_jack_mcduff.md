## Biography
Eugene McDuffy, professionally known as "Brother" Jack McDuff or "Captain" Jack McDuff, was born on September 17, 1926, in Champaign, Illinois. He initially pursued music as a bassist, performing in groups led by Joe Farrell and Willis Jackson in the late 1950s. Encouraged by Willis Jackson, McDuff made the pivotal transition to organ in the mid-1950s, teaching himself the instrument and quickly establishing himself as a distinctive voice in jazz. His early work with Jackson's band caught the attention of Prestige Records, launching his career as a bandleader and recording artist.

McDuff became one of the most prominent figures in hard bop and soul jazz during the 1960s, leading organ trios that became among the most popular combos of the era. His signature sound on the Hammond B-3 organ was characterized by rock-solid basslines, blues-drenched solos, and clever, almost pianistic melodies. He recorded prolifically for Prestige Records beginning in 1960, producing classic albums including *Brother Jack*, *The Honeydripper*, and *Brother Jack McDuff Live!*, which featured his biggest hit "Rock Candy." McDuff's most significant contribution to jazz history came through his mentorship of a young guitarist named George Benson, whom he hired and featured prominently in his bands during the mid-1960s, giving Benson his first major break in the music industry.

After his successful Prestige years, McDuff recorded for Atlantic, Blue Note, and other labels throughout the 1970s and 1980s, experimenting with electronic keyboards and fusion during the latter decade. He experienced a career resurgence in 1988 with *The Re-Entry* on the Muse label, continuing to record for Concord Jazz in the 1990s. McDuff remained active until his death on January 23, 2001, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, at age 74, leaving behind a legacy as one of the funkiest and most soulful organists in jazz history.
