## Quick Info

- **Origin**: Houston, Texas, United States

## Biography
Khruangbin is a Houston-based trio formed in the late 2000s, consisting of guitarist Mark Speer, bassist Laura Lee, and drummer Donald 'DJ' Johnson. The band's origins trace back to 2004, when Speer and Johnson met while playing in a church gospel band in Houston, with Johnson on organ and Speer on guitar. Their shared passion for global music, particularly the psychedelic and funk sounds of the 1960s and 70s, laid the foundation for Khruangbin's eclectic style. Laura Lee joined after meeting Speer through mutual friends, initially learning bass to fill out the trio. The band’s name, meaning 'airplane' in Thai, reflects their fascination with international music, especially Thai funk, and their desire to create a sound that transcends borders.

Khruangbin's early years were marked by experimentation and a commitment to recording before performing live. They crafted their first EP in a makeshift studio known as 'the Barn' in Burton, Texas, before Lee’s temporary move to London helped spark international interest. Their breakthrough came when their track 'A Calf Born in Winter' was featured on Bonobo’s 'Late Night Tales' compilation in 2013, leading to a record deal and wider recognition. The band’s subsequent albums and energetic live shows, including festival appearances at Glastonbury, Bonnaroo, and Austin City Limits, have cemented their reputation for blending neo-psychedelic grooves with global influences, from Thai funk to Middle Eastern soul.

Khruangbin’s legacy lies in their ability to bridge cultures through music, creating instrumental soundscapes that are both nostalgic and forward-thinking. Their minimalist yet richly textured arrangements, anchored by Lee’s melodic basslines, Speer’s reverb-heavy guitar, and Johnson’s understated drumming, have inspired a new wave of artists interested in cross-cultural fusion and instrumental storytelling.

## Fun Facts
