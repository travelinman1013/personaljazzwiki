## Biography
Creole George Guesnon (May 25, 1907 – May 6, 1968) was a pioneering jazz banjoist, guitarist, singer, and composer from New Orleans, Louisiana. Raised in the Tremé neighborhood, Guesnon was immersed in the city's vibrant musical culture from a young age. Inspired by his uncle, he began playing ukulele at twelve and later transitioned to banjo, initially self-taught and using ukulele tuning before receiving formal instruction from John Marrero. By his early twenties, Guesnon was performing in local cabarets and quickly established himself in the New Orleans jazz scene, replacing prominent musicians in bands such as Papa Celestin’s Original Tuxedo Jazz Orchestra and Willie Pajeaud’s orchestra.

Guesnon's career was marked by versatility and innovation. He worked with Sam Morgan’s band throughout the early 1930s, then moved to Jackson, Mississippi, to join Little Brother Montgomery’s orchestra, recording his first song, "Goodbye, Good Luck to You," in 1936. He toured with the Rabbit Foot Minstrels and later relocated to New York City, where he collaborated with Jelly Roll Morton and recorded for Decca. After serving in the Merchant Marines during World War II, Guesnon returned to New Orleans, performing with groups like the Mighty Four and touring with George Lewis. In the 1950s and 1960s, he became a fixture at Preservation Hall, contributing to the preservation and revival of traditional New Orleans jazz.

Guesnon's musical style was distinguished by a blues-inflected approach, innovative banjo technique, and expressive vocals. He was a prolific composer, recording nearly 100 original works and leaving a legacy as both a performer and a preserver of New Orleans musical traditions. His influence extended through collaborations with leading jazz figures and his role in sustaining the city’s jazz heritage until his retirement in 1965.
