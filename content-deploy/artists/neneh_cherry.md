## Biography
Neneh Cherry (born Neneh Mariann Karlsson on 10 March 1964 in Stockholm, Sweden) is a Swedish singer, songwriter, rapper and occasional DJ whose work has consistently blended hip‑hop, pop, punk, and jazz with a strong experimental edge.[1][2] Raised between Sweden, the United States, and the UK, she is of Swedish and Sierra Leonean heritage and grew up in a creative, politically engaged environment; her stepfather was renowned jazz trumpeter Don Cherry, and she later took his surname.[1][2] Cherry left school at 14 and moved to London in the late 1970s, immersing herself in the city’s punk and post‑punk scenes, squatting with members of The Slits and joining a succession of adventurous bands including The Cherries, The Slits, New Age Steppers, Rip Rig + Panic, and Float Up CP, while also DJing early rap on the Dread Broadcasting Corporation pirate station.[1][2][3]

By the early 1980s Cherry had begun a solo career, releasing the anti‑Falklands War single “Stop the War” in 1982 and working with producer Jonny Dollar, The The, and songwriter/producer Cameron McVey (Booga Bear), whom she later married.[1][4] Her breakthrough came with her 1989 debut album **Raw Like Sushi**, a genre‑bending, sample‑driven set that reached No. 2 on the UK Albums Chart and produced the global hit “Buffalo Stance,” earning Brit Awards and a Grammy nomination for Best New Artist.[1][2] She followed with **Homebrew** (1992) and **Man** (1996), the latter featuring the worldwide hit “7 Seconds,” a collaboration with Senegalese star Youssou N’Dour that topped the French charts for a then‑record 16 weeks and garnered another Grammy nomination.[1][2][4] After a quieter period focused on family and collaborations, she formed the band cirKus and released **Laylow** (2006), recorded the jazz‑leaning **The Cherry Thing** with Scandinavian trio The Thing (2012), and returned to acclaimed solo work with **Blank Project** (2014) and **Broken Politics** (2018), before issuing the collaborative reinterpretation album **The Versions** in 2022.[1]

Across her career, Cherry’s music has been marked by a fearless hybrid of hip‑hop beats, punk attitude, pop hooks, and jazz/world‑music textures, underpinned by socially conscious lyrics and a conversational vocal style that moves fluidly between rapping and singing.[1][2][4] Closely linked to the Bristol scene around Massive Attack and the UK post‑punk diaspora, she helped normalize women rapping and fronting genre‑fluid projects in mainstream European pop in the late 1980s and 1990s.[1][4] Her influence can be traced in subsequent generations of alternative pop and trip‑hop artists, and she remains a respected, boundary‑pushing figure whose later work continues to be recognized, including Swedish Grammis awards for **The Cherry Thing** and **Broken Politics**.[1]

## Fun Facts
- Cherry dropped out of school at 14 and moved from Sweden to London alone in her mid‑teens, finding a home in the city’s punk squats and joining The Slits’ circle before she had any solo releases.[1][3]
- Before her pop breakthrough, she was a DJ on the West London reggae pirate station Dread Broadcasting Corporation, where she played early rap records on air.[1][3]
- Her hit “Buffalo Stance” earned her a 1990 Grammy nomination for Best New Artist, which she lost to Milli Vanilli—the duo later had their Grammy revoked in a major industry scandal.[2]
- She is the half‑sister of singer Eagle‑Eye Cherry, and the daughter/stepdaughter of two musicians (Monika Karlsson and Don Cherry), making music a multigenerational family profession.[1][2]
