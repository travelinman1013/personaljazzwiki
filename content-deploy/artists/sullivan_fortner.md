## Biography
Sullivan Joseph Fortner (born December 29, 1986) is an American jazz pianist, composer, bandleader, and educator from New Orleans, Louisiana.[2][3] Raised in a church-going family, he was first drawn to keyboards after seeing a woman play organ in a local church, and began piano at around age four; by seven he was playing organ in his mother’s Baptist church choir and developing an unusually acute ear and perfect pitch.[2][4][6] As a teenager he enrolled at the New Orleans Center for Creative Arts (NOCCA), where formal training challenged him to move beyond playing strictly by ear and into rigorous study of harmony, theory, and jazz tradition.[2][4][6] Fortner went on to earn a Bachelor of Music from Oberlin Conservatory and a Master of Music in Jazz Performance from the Manhattan School of Music, cementing a foundation that blends New Orleans roots with conservatory-level technical refinement.[1][3]

Over more than a decade on the international scene, Fortner has become known as one of the leading jazz pianists of his generation, praised for his virtuosic technique, deep swing feel, and harmonically adventurous yet tradition‑steeped style.[3][4][9] He first gained wide recognition as a sideman with vibraphonist Stefon Harris in 2009 and then as the regular pianist in trumpeter Roy Hargrove’s quintet from 2010 to 2017, roles that positioned him at the center of contemporary straight‑ahead jazz.[2][1] His own recordings as a leader on Impulse! Records, including *Aria* and *Moments Preserved*, showcase a modern piano language that connects stride, bebop, gospel, blues, and classical inflections, often in trio and quartet formats that highlight his rhythmic flexibility and melodic imagination.[2] A Grammy Award‑winning artist, Fortner received major honors such as the 2015 American Pianists Association Cole Porter Fellowship in Jazz, the Leonore Annenberg Arts Fellowship, and the Lincoln Center Award for Emerging Artists, while performing at premier venues and festivals such as the Village Vanguard, Jazz at Lincoln Center, Newport and Monterey Jazz Festivals.[2][3]

Fortner’s musical identity is marked by a strong sense of narrative improvisation, dense but lyrical harmonic exploration, and a deep engagement with the blues and spirituals that reflect his New Orleans and church upbringing.[3][4] Critics have noted how he freely references multiple eras of jazz piano—from early swing and stride to post‑bop and contemporary avant‑garde—yet organizes these elements into a coherent, personal language that respects tradition while pushing it forward.[1][3][4] Alongside his performance career, he has become a dedicated educator and mentor, offering masterclasses at institutions including Manhattan School of Music, NOCCA, Purdue University, Belmont University, and Oberlin Conservatory, where he has also served on the faculty and later returned as visiting professor of jazz piano.[3] Through this combination of performance, collaboration, and teaching, Fortner is steadily building a legacy as both a creative innovator and a bridge between generations in modern jazz.

## Fun Facts
- Fortner’s initial inspiration to play keyboard came from seeing a woman playing organ in a local church; he soon began playing organ himself in his mother’s Baptist church choir, relying heavily on his perfect pitch before learning to read music formally.[2]
- He developed so much skill by ear that when he reached NOCCA he had to relearn aspects of music using notation and theory rather than just his hearing, a transition he has described as pivotal to his growth.[2][6]
- In 2019 he led his own band for a week‑long engagement at New York’s storied Village Vanguard, a milestone he later repeated in 2020 as a virtual performance during lockdown.[3]
- Beyond straight‑ahead jazz, he has worked in high‑profile cross‑genre contexts, including contributing piano parts to Paul Simon’s album *In the Blue Light*, reflecting his versatility outside the traditional jazz circuit.[2]
