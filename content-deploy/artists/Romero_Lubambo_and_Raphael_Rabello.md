## Biography
Romero Lubambo and Raphael Rabello were both virtuoso Brazilian guitarists, each leaving a distinct mark on Brazilian jazz and choro music, though they represent different generations and musical trajectories. Romero Lubambo, born in 1955 in Rio de Janeiro, grew up surrounded by American jazz and classical music, thanks to his guitar-playing uncle. He began playing guitar at age 13, largely self-taught, and later studied classical guitar at the Villa-Lobos School of Music. Despite earning an engineering degree, Lubambo pursued music full-time, moving to the U.S. in 1985 and quickly establishing himself as a sought-after session musician and bandleader, notably forming Trio da Paz with Duduka da Fonseca and Nilson Matta[2]. His style blends Brazilian rhythms with jazz harmony, and he has collaborated with a wide array of international stars, from Astrud Gilberto to Dianne Reeves and Diana Krall[2]. Raphael Rabello, born in 1962 in Petrópolis, Rio de Janeiro, came from a musical family—his sisters Amélia and Luciana were also musicians. He began guitar lessons at age seven, studying with his brother and later with renowned teachers like Jaime Florence (Meira) and Dino 7 Cordas. Rabello started performing professionally as a teenager, co-founding Os Carioquinhas and later joining Camerata Carioca. He became a prolific studio musician, participating in over 600 recordings, and released 16 albums as a leader, specializing in choro and Brazilian popular music. Rabello’s technical mastery and emotional depth earned him admiration from peers like Tom Jobim and Paco de Lucía, but his career was tragically cut short by his death in 1995[1][3]. Both artists are celebrated for expanding the expressive possibilities of the guitar in Brazilian music, with Lubambo continuing to influence new generations of musicians worldwide[2].

## Fun Facts
- Raphael Rabello was known as 'Raphael 7 Cordas' early in his career, a nod to his mastery of the Brazilian seven-string guitar and his mentor Dino 7 Cordas[3].
- Rabello contracted HIV during surgery after a car accident in 1989, a tragedy that deeply affected his later years[3].
- Romero Lubambo initially studied classical piano for two years before switching to guitar, which he largely taught himself[2].
- Lubambo's album 'Dos Navegantes' with Edu Lobo and Mauro Senise won the 2017 Latin Grammy Award for Best MPB Album[2].
