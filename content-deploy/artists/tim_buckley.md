## Biography
Timothy Charles 'Tim' Buckley III was born on February 14, 1947, in Los Angeles, California, and became one of the most innovative and boundary-pushing musicians of the 1960s and early 1970s. After a brief and unsuccessful attempt at college in 1965, Buckley dedicated himself entirely to music, performing regularly at Los Angeles folk clubs. In February 1966, following a recommendation from Mothers of Invention drummer Jimmy Carl Black to manager Herb Cohen, Buckley secured an extended gig at the Nite Owl Café in Greenwich Village, New York, which launched his professional career. His musical journey spanned nine studio albums from 1966 to 1974, during which he continuously evolved his artistic vision, refusing to be confined by commercial expectations or fan preferences.

Buckley's career can be divided into distinct musical periods, each reflecting his relentless pursuit of artistic innovation. His initial period (1966-1968) established him as a folk-rock singer-songwriter with albums like Tim Buckley (1966), Goodbye and Hello (1967), and Happy/Sad (1968), the latter reaching his highest chart position at #81. The second period (1969-1970) saw him embrace experimental and avant-garde approaches, inspired by composers Luciano Berio and Iannis Xenakis, as well as vocalist Cathy Berberian, resulting in the ambitious albums Lorca, Blue Afternoon, and Starsailor. His final period (1970-1974) featured what critics described as 'sex funk'—a fusion of funk, soul, and experimental elements heard on Greetings from L.A., Sefronia, and Look at the Fool. Despite critical acclaim and recognition from fellow musicians, Buckley struggled with commercial success and became increasingly alienated from his audience due to his refusal to repeat past material.

Tim Buckley died on June 29, 1975, at age 28, from an accidental heroin overdose, leaving behind a legacy that would profoundly influence generations of musicians. Though he did not achieve significant commercial success during his lifetime, his influence is felt across multiple genres and generations. He is remembered for his extraordinary vocal range, his innovative use of the voice as an instrument, and his pioneering integration of jazz, psychedelia, funk, and avant-garde elements into rock music. His willingness to constantly reinvent himself and push musical boundaries established him as a visionary artist whose work continues to inspire musicians and listeners seeking artistic authenticity over commercial appeal.

## Fun Facts
- Tim Buckley described his own debut album as 'like Disneyland,' expressing significant dissatisfaction with the final product despite its folk-rock appeal and critical recognition of his distinctive voice.
- Buckley's girlfriend Jainie Goldstein drove him cross-country in a Volkswagen bug from Los Angeles to New York for his pivotal Nite Owl Café gig in 1966, a journey that helped launch his professional career.
- In 1975, shortly before his death, Buckley quit using drugs and attempted a comeback by performing revamped versions of material from his entire career, notably excluding songs from his Starsailor and Lorca albums—the very experimental works he had been most passionate about.
- Buckley appeared in an experimental low-budget group therapy-drama film called 'Why?' (1971), which was one of the first uses of videotape as a medium, commissioned by Technicolor, though the film remained unreleased.
