## Biography
Charlyn Marie "Chan" Marshall, known professionally as Cat Power, is an influential American singer-songwriter born on January 21, 1972, in Atlanta, Georgia. Raised throughout the southern United States, Marshall experienced a nomadic childhood, moving frequently and attending numerous schools. She taught herself guitar and began performing in the Atlanta music scene in the early 1990s, initially as part of a band named Cat Power—a name inspired by a trucker cap she saw. After dropping out of high school, she immersed herself in local music circles, playing with friends and experimenting with her sound.

In 1992, Marshall relocated to New York City, where she connected with key figures in the indie music world, notably Steve Shelley of Sonic Youth and Tim Foljahn of Two Dollar Guitar. These collaborations led to her first two albums, 'Dear Sir' (1995) and 'Myra Lee' (1996), which established her as a distinctive voice in the slowcore and singer-songwriter genres. Over the years, Cat Power's music evolved from sparse, emotionally raw indie rock to incorporate blues, folk, and soul influences, culminating in critically acclaimed albums such as 'Moon Pix' (1998), 'You Are Free' (2003), and 'The Greatest' (2006). Her work is marked by introspective lyrics, haunting vocals, and a willingness to reinterpret classic songs, as seen in her celebrated covers albums. Cat Power's legacy is defined by her resilience, artistic authenticity, and her profound impact on indie and alternative music.
