# THE NEW ORLEANS OWLS

## Biography
The New Orleans Owls were a jazz band active from 1922 to 1929, originating from the Invincibles String Band formed in New Orleans in 1912. This precursor group included key musicians such as Johnny Wiggs, Eblen Rau, Benjy White, Rene Gelpi, Monk Smith, Earl Crumb, and Mose Farrar, who later formed the Owls. Led primarily by Benjamin 'Benjie' White on reeds, the band performed elegant dance music like fox-trots in New Orleans hotel ballrooms, notably the Hotel Roosevelt, typically as a seven-piece ensemble though 22 different musicians passed through over the years.[1][5]

The band recorded 23 sides for Columbia Records between September 1925 and October 1927, making them one of the few New Orleans groups captured on record in the 1920s during that decade. Sessions occurred in New Orleans (e.g., April 1926, October 1927) and Atlanta (November 1926), pioneering the use of an electrical system via a mobile recording van for some tracks. Their polished, hot style featured tunes like 'Stomp Off – Let’s Go,' 'Goose Pimples,' and 'The Owls’ Hoot,' blending ragtime influences without the raw edge of some contemporaries, prioritizing danceable sophistication.[2][3][4]

Though opinions divide traditional jazz fans—some praising their ideal sound, others noting a lack of 'gutsiness'—the Owls excelled at pleasing 1920s dancers. Their legacy endures through preserved recordings, highlighting New Orleans' vibrant early jazz scene alongside bands like Sam Morgan's and Armand Piron's.[1][3]

## Fun Facts
- The band descended from the 1912 Invincibles String Band, with seven original members transitioning directly into the Owls.[1][5]
- They were among the first to record using Columbia's mobile electrical recording van, enabling sessions in remote locations like Atlanta in 1926.[4]
- Recorded 'Goose Pimples' on October 26, 1927, just days after versions by Fletcher Henderson's group and New Orleans Lucky Seven.[2]
- Their name omitted 'Jazz,' reflecting a focus on polished dance music rather than raw improvisation for 1920s fox-trot dancers.[1]
