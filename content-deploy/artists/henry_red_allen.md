## Biography
Henry 'Red' Allen, born Henry James Allen Jr. on January 7, 1908, in Algiers, Louisiana, grew up immersed in New Orleans jazz culture as the son of trumpeter Henry Allen Sr., who led a prominent brass band. By age ten, Red was marching in his father's band, and at seventeen, he played his first steady gig with saxophonist John Handy in 1925. He honed his skills on riverboats with Fate Marable in 1927-1929, developing a flamboyant, exploratory trumpet style characterized by rhythmic flexibility, harmonic adventurousness, and a clear, polished tone with slower vibrato—often seen as an innovative alternative to Louis Armstrong's influence, though contemporaries sometimes accused him of 'wrong notes' that later proved visionary.[1][2]

Allen moved to New York in 1927 to join King Oliver's band, making his recording debut with Clarence Williams before returning home briefly. In 1929, he rejoined Luis Russell's orchestra as Victor Records' rival to Armstrong, establishing his reputation with recordings like 'Biffly Blues.' He played with Fletcher Henderson (1933-1934), influencing figures like Harry James, then the Mills Blue Rhythm Band (1934-1937), freelancing extensively. From 1937 to 1940, he was in Louis Armstrong's orchestra via Russell, serving as a warm-up act while freelancing on 52nd Street. In 1940, Allen formed his own sextet at Cafe Society, blending swing, New Orleans jazz, and jump rhythms, later leading at the Metropole (1954-1965) during the Dixieland revival, showcasing mature blues improvisation and lower-register exploration.[1][2][3]

Allen's legacy endures as a swing-era trumpet master and vocalist whose forward-thinking style bridged eras, from hot jazz to bebop influences, though bebop diminished his New York prominence in the 1940s-1950s, leading to extensive touring. He remained active until his death on April 17, 1967, celebrated for energetic performances, riff-driven leads, and showmanship without compromising innovation, notably stealing the show at the 1965 Monterey Jazz Festival alongside Clark Terry, Rex Stewart, and Dizzy Gillespie.[1][2][5]
