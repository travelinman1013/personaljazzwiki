# THE SAVOY BEARCATS

## Biography
The Savoy Bearcats were formed in late 1925 in Charleston, South Carolina, by pianist Duncan Mayers under the initial name Charleston Bearcats. The band quickly rose to prominence as one of the first colored Harlem big bands recorded by RCA Victor Talking Machine Company, capturing their energetic ragtime and early jazz sound in sessions starting August 1926 in New York. They became a house band at the newly opened Savoy Ballroom—known as the 'Home of Happy Feet'—inaugurating the venue on March 12, 1926, alongside Fess Williams and his Royal Flush Orchestra and Fletcher Henderson Orchestra.[1][2][4]

Under leaders like Leon Abbey and Duncan Mayers, the Savoy Bearcats developed a hot, driving style characterized by strong trumpet leads, expert reed sections, and rhythmic precision suited to Harlem's dance scene. After a year at the Savoy, they toured South America extensively from May 1927 to year's end as Leon Abbey and his Orchestra, releasing notable Victor records like 'How Could I Be Blue?' Their lineup evolved, featuring talents such as Gilbert Paris and Demas Dean on trumpet, James Reevy on trombone, and reed players Carmelo Jari, Otto Mikell, and Ramon Hernandez.[1][2]

The band continued performing possibly until 1932, maintaining ties to the Savoy Ballroom and other Harlem spots, with later personnel including Rex Stewart, Charlie Green, and Tiny Bradshaw. As pioneers of the Harlem big band era, they bridged ragtime dance music with emerging swing, influencing the vibrant ballroom scene despite limited discography.[1]
