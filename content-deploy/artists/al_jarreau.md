## Biography
Alwin Lopez Jarreau was born on March 12, 1940, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the fifth of six children in a musical family; his father was a Seventh-day Adventist minister and singer, while his mother taught piano and played church organ. As a child, he sang in church choirs and at local venues. Jarreau earned a psychology degree from Ripon College in 1962, where he performed with the group Indigos, and a master's in vocational rehabilitation from the University of Iowa in 1964. He worked as a rehabilitation counselor in San Francisco, moonlighting in jazz clubs with George Duke's trio before partnering with guitarist Julio Martinez in 1967 at Sausalito's Gatsby's nightclub, prompting his full-time music career shift.[1][2][3][4]
