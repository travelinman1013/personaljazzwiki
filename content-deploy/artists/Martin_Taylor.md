## Biography
Martin Taylor, MBE (born October 20, 1956, in Harlow, Essex, England) is a British jazz guitarist renowned for his virtuosic fingerstyle technique and his ability to blend melody, harmony, and bass lines seamlessly on the guitar. Raised in a musically rich family with a Gypsy heritage, Taylor was introduced to jazz at an early age by his father, William 'Buck' Taylor, a jazz bassist who frequently played music in the style of Django Reinhardt. By age eight, Martin was performing in his father's band, and at fifteen, he left school to pursue music professionally, quickly gaining experience in bands, holiday camps, radio, and cruise ships—including a memorable jam with the Count Basie Orchestra.

Taylor's career took a pivotal turn when he met jazz guitarist Ike Isaacs, who became both a mentor and duet partner, helping Taylor refine his jazz harmony and fingerstyle approach. Through Isaacs, Taylor was introduced to the legendary French jazz violinist Stéphane Grappelli, with whom he toured and recorded for over a decade from 1979 to 1990. Their collaboration, including the Grammy-nominated album 'Together At Last' with Vassar Clements, established Taylor as a major figure in jazz. In the 1980s, Taylor began a successful solo career, releasing acclaimed albums with Linn Records, and later formed the group Spirit of Django in the 1990s, further exploring his love of gypsy jazz.

Taylor's musical style is characterized by a sophisticated solo guitar approach that integrates walking bass lines, chordal accompaniment, and melodic improvisation, drawing inspiration from Django Reinhardt, Art Tatum, Kenny Burrell, Wes Montgomery, and Joe Pass. His innovations have influenced a generation of guitarists, and his legacy is cemented by numerous awards, collaborations with artists across genres, and his ongoing role as an educator through the Martin Taylor Guitar Academy.

## Fun Facts
- Taylor was awarded an MBE (Member of the Order of the British Empire) in 2002 for services to jazz music.
- He is entirely self-taught, developing his unique fingerstyle technique without formal instruction.
- Taylor once jammed with the Count Basie Orchestra while working as a cruise ship musician as a teenager.
