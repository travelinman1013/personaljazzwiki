## Quick Info

## Biography
Protoje, born Oje Ken Ollivierre on June 23, 1981, in Saint Elizabeth, Jamaica, grew up in a deeply musical household, the son of singer Lorna Bennett and former calypso king Mike Ollivierre of St. Vincent and the Grenadines.[1][2][3] He attended Munro College in St. Elizabeth and briefly considered following his mother into law before committing fully to music, having been fascinated by Jamaican sounds and artists like Buju Banton from an early age.[7] His multicultural upbringing between Jamaica and time spent in the United States helped shape his broad musical perspective and socially aware worldview.[1]

Emerging in the 2000s, Protoje first released singles such as “Awakening” in 2006 and gained wider attention with “Kingston Be Wise” around 2010, which showcased his blend of roots reggae, dancehall, hip‑hop and dub.[1][6] His debut album *The Seven Year Itch* (2010/2011) was followed by *The 8 Year Affair* (2013), *Ancient Future* (2015), *A Matter of Time* (2018) and *In Search of Lost Time* (2020), projects that cemented him as a leading voice in the so‑called “Reggae Revival,” a movement of contemporary Jamaican artists reviving roots-conscious reggae.[2][4][6] Tracks like “Rasta Love” (feat. Ky-Mani Marley), “Kingston Be Wise,” “Who Knows” (feat. Chronixx), and “Blood Money” brought him international attention, with *Ancient Future* and *A Matter of Time* both topping the Billboard Reggae Albums chart and the latter earning a Grammy nomination for Best Reggae Album.[1][2][6]

Protoje’s music is defined by **conscious, socially engaged lyricism**—often addressing corruption, inequality, identity and empowerment—paired with a modern fusion of reggae, hip‑hop, soul, jazz, R&B and rock elements.[1][2][3] As leader of his band The Indiggnation and founder of the In.Digg.Nation Collective label/management company, he has not only helped globalize the Reggae Revival through extensive touring and major festival appearances, but has also championed and developed a new generation of Jamaican artists, including Lila Iké, Sevana and Jaz Elise.[2][4][5] His 2020 partnership deal with RCA Records, which included individual album deals for those rising artists, further underscored his role as both creator and architect of contemporary Jamaican music infrastructure and culture.[2]
