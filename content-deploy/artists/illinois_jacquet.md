## Biography
Illinois Jacquet, born Jean Baptiste Jacquet on October 31, 1922, in Broussard, Louisiana, was a pioneering American jazz tenor saxophonist whose exuberant style helped define the sound of swing, bebop, and rhythm and blues. Raised in Houston, Texas, in a musical family, Jacquet began performing at a young age, first as a tap dancer and drummer in his father's band before taking up the saxophone. By age 15, he was already playing with the Milt Larkin Orchestra, and after moving to Los Angeles in 1941, he quickly found himself immersed in the burgeoning West Coast jazz scene[1][3][4].

Jacquet's breakthrough came in 1942 when, at just 19, he recorded the iconic tenor sax solo on Lionel Hampton's 'Flying Home.' This electrifying performance introduced the 'honking' tenor style, characterized by powerful, high-register wails and rhythmic drive, which would become a hallmark of both rhythm and blues and early rock and roll. Jacquet's innovative approach expanded the expressive range of the tenor saxophone and influenced generations of musicians. Over his long career, he played with major big bands, including those of Lionel Hampton, Cab Calloway, and Count Basie, and was a star attraction in Norman Granz's Jazz at the Philharmonic concert series. He also led his own groups, recorded prolifically, and remained an active performer and bandleader into the 21st century[2][3][4].

Jacquet's legacy is marked by his technical mastery, his role in bridging jazz and R&B, and his charismatic stage presence. He was one of the few jazz musicians to master the bassoon as well as the saxophone and was celebrated for both his fiery uptempo solos and his sensitive ballad playing. Jacquet passed away on July 21, 2004, but his influence endures in the worlds of jazz, blues, and popular music[1][3][4].
