## Biography
Charles Sheffield, born Charles Richard Sheffield, Jr. on February 16, 1931 in Beaumont, Texas, was a blues and R&B singer who became a cult figure in the Gulf Coast music scene of the late 1950s and early 1960s. He began his recording career under the moniker 'Mad Dog Sheffield' in 1957, cutting his first single 'Mad Dog' for the Goldband label, backed by the Clarence Garlow Orchestra. Despite early efforts, his initial releases did not achieve commercial success, but they established him as a dynamic performer in the Louisiana and Texas circuit.[1][6]

Sheffield's most notable work came after he began recording with producer J.D. Miller in Crowley, Louisiana. In 1961, he released 'It's Your Voodoo Working' on Excello Records, a track that blended swamp blues, R&B, and Afro-Caribbean rhythms. Though it failed to chart nationally at the time, the song has since become a northern soul favorite and is widely celebrated for its hypnotic groove and Sheffield's charismatic vocal delivery. Sheffield recorded only a handful of singles, including sides for Miller's Rocko label and later as 'Prince Charles' for Huey Meaux's Teardrop and Jetstream labels. Disillusioned by the lack of commercial success, he left the music business and faded from the public eye, but his recordings have been rediscovered and revered by collectors and soul enthusiasts in subsequent decades.[1][2][5]

Sheffield's legacy rests on his ability to channel the unique sounds of the Gulf Coast, fusing blues, R&B, and regional influences into a style that was ahead of its time. His work, particularly 'It's Your Voodoo Working,' has been recognized posthumously as a classic, influencing later generations of soul and blues musicians and earning him a place in the pantheon of underappreciated American R&B artists.[1][2][5]
