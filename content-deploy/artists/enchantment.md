## Biography
Enchantment is a classic soul and R&B vocal group formed in Detroit, Michigan, in the late 1960s. The original members—Emanuel 'EJ' Johnson, Joe 'Jobie' Thomas, David Banks, Ed 'Mickey' Clanton, and Bobby Green—came together at Pershing High School, inspired by the vibrant Motown scene that surrounded them. Their first major break came in 1969 when they won a local talent contest sponsored by radio station WCHB, earning their initial recording contract and quickly establishing themselves as a promising act in Detroit's competitive music landscape.[1][2][5]

Throughout the 1970s, Enchantment honed their stagecraft and vocal harmonies, working with talent development agencies and performing at local venues. Their partnership with producer Michael Stokes proved pivotal, leading to their debut album 'Enchantment' in 1976 on Roadshow Records. The group’s smooth, melodious style—characterized by EJ Johnson’s emotive falsetto and lush arrangements—yielded hits like 'Gloria' and 'Sunshine,' which became staples of the quiet storm and classic soul genres. Despite commercial challenges and label changes in the early 1980s, Enchantment continued to record and perform, leaving a lasting legacy as one of Detroit’s most beloved soul groups.[3][5]

Enchantment’s music is noted for its heartfelt ballads and sophisticated harmonies, drawing on influences from Motown legends and contributing to the evolution of R&B in the late 20th century. Their work remains influential, with EJ Johnson later finding success in gospel music and the group continuing to perform at soul music festivals and multi-artist shows, maintaining their reputation as consummate entertainers.[3][6]
