## Biography
Hi Rhythm, also known as the Hi Rhythm Section, was a legendary Memphis-based studio band that defined the sound of Southern soul in the 1970s. The group was formed by producer Willie Mitchell at Hi Records and centered around the three Hodges brothers: guitarist Mabon "Teenie" Hodges, bassist Leroy Hodges, and organist Charles Hodges. Their musical journey began in the late 1950s and early 1960s, playing together in their father's band, the Germantown Blue Dots, before forming The Impalas. Their close-knit familial bond and intuitive interplay became the backbone of the Hi Records sound, which was further shaped by the addition of pianist Archie Turner and drummer Howard Grimes (and occasionally Stax's Al Jackson Jr.)[2][3][4].

The Hi Rhythm Section became the house band for Hi Records, contributing their signature warm, swirling soul grooves to countless hit records by artists such as Al Green, Ann Peebles, O.V. Wright, Syl Johnson, and Otis Clay. Their understated yet deeply emotive playing style was essential to the label's success, helping to create a new, smoother Memphis soul sound distinct from the grittier Stax approach. As songwriters and musicians, they co-wrote and performed on many of Al Green's biggest hits, including "Love and Happiness" and "Take Me to the River." The group released their own album, "On the Loose," in 1976 and continued to collaborate with soul and blues artists for decades, even reuniting to work with Cat Power on her acclaimed 2006 album "The Greatest." In 2016, they were inducted into the Memphis Music Hall of Fame, cementing their legacy as one of the most influential rhythm sections in American music[2][3][4].
