## Biography
Red Simpson (born Joe Cecil Simpson on March 6, 1934, in Higley, Arizona) was an American country singer, songwriter, and multi‑instrumentalist best known as one of the defining voices of truck‑driving country and a key figure in the Bakersfield Sound.[1][3][5][6] The youngest of a large migrant farmworker family, he moved with his parents to Bakersfield, California, in 1937, growing up in a working‑class environment that later shaped his down‑to‑earth storytelling.[1][3][6] After serving in the U.S. Navy during the Korean War, where he taught himself fiddle and mandolin and formed his first band aboard the hospital ship USS Repose, he returned to Bakersfield determined to pursue music professionally.[4][5][6] By his teens he was already writing songs, and in the 1950s he worked Bakersfield clubs as a sideman on piano and guitar, gradually becoming part of the city’s influential honky‑tonk scene.[4][5]

Simpson’s break came through club owner and producer Fuzzy Owen, who hired him as a piano player at the Clover Club and helped him into regular weekend slots at the famed Blackboard Café, where he often filled in for Buck Owens and played alongside future stars like Merle Haggard.[1][3][4][5] Encouraged by bandleader Bill Woods to write truck songs, Simpson began crafting material that caught the ear of Capitol Records producer Ken Nelson, who was looking for a singer to front a trucking‑song project.[1][4][5] Signing with Capitol in the mid‑1960s, Simpson scored country hits with “Roll, Truck, Roll,” “The Highway Patrol,” and “Diesel Smoke, Dangerous Curves,” and released a string of albums that cemented his reputation as a specialist in vivid, often humorous portraits of life on the road.[3][4][5] His biggest hit, “I’m a Truck” (also known as “Hello, I’m a Truck”), reached the country Top 5 in 1971 and brought him to the Grand Ole Opry several times in the early 1970s.[1][3][4][5] Though he recorded police‑themed and Christmas trucking albums and later signed with Warner Bros. for Truck Driver’s Heaven, he remained closely tied to Bakersfield’s Telecaster‑driven, honky‑tonk sound rather than relocating to Nashville.[1][4][5]

Musically, Simpson blended classic honky‑tonk with bright, twanging electric guitar, barroom piano, and straightforward vocals that reflected the working‑class Central Valley culture around him.[3][4][6] Beyond his own recordings, he was a respected songwriter and session musician who contributed to Merle Haggard’s “Okie from Muskogee” and wrote or co‑wrote songs recorded by Buck Owens and other Bakersfield acts.[3][4][5] He continued performing in Bakersfield clubs well into his eighties, helping keep the local scene alive until his death from complications of a heart attack on January 8, 2016, at age 81.[3][5][6][7] Simpson’s legacy rests both on his role in giving truck drivers a voice in country music and on his under‑recognized contribution to the Bakersfield Sound, which later influenced artists such as Dwight Yoakam, Brad Paisley, and Clint Black who drew on that hard‑twanging West Coast tradition.[3][5]

## Fun Facts
- Simpson learned fiddle and mandolin on inexpensive instruments he bought in Japan while serving aboard the Navy hospital ship USS Repose during the Korean War, and he formed his first band, the Repose Ramblers, right on the ship.[4][5]
- Before becoming known as a singer, Simpson was primarily a club sideman and piano player in Bakersfield, only stepping into the spotlight after Fuzzy Owen spotted him and began giving him higher‑profile work.[1][4][5]
- His trademark hit “I’m a Truck” was not written by Simpson himself but by a Washington State postman named Bob (or Bobb) Stanton/Staunton; Simpson’s recording turned the postal worker’s song into a national country smash.[1][3][5]
- In addition to trucking songs, Simpson recorded a Christmas‑themed trucking album (often titled Truckin’ Trees for Christmas or Truckers Christmas), combining holiday music with long‑haul narratives—one of the more unusual hybrids in country’s concept‑album history.[4][5]

## Musical Connections

### Mentors/Influences
- [[bill_woods|Bill Woods]] - Early Bakersfield bandleader who encouraged Simpson’s songwriting and specifically asked him to write truck‑driving songs, helping define his thematic niche. (Early truck songs written for Woods’ recording plans (four trucking songs before Woods stopped recording).) [Mid‑1950s to early 1960s[1][4][5]]
- [[fuzzy_owen|Fuzzy Owen]] - Bakersfield club owner and producer who discovered Simpson at the Wagon Wheel and gave him steady work at the Clover Club, helping launch his professional career. (Live piano work at the Clover Club; broader involvement in the Bakersfield scene leading to Capitol connections.) [1950s–1960s[1][4][5]]
- [[buck_owens|Buck Owens]] - Major Bakersfield star whose twanging country style and club presence influenced Simpson; Simpson frequently substituted for Owens at the Blackboard Café. (Shared Bakersfield club circuit; Simpson later wrote songs recorded by Owens.) [Late 1950s–1970s[1][3][4][5]]
- [[merle_haggard|Merle Haggard]] - Fellow architect of the Bakersfield Sound whose style and success helped shape the musical environment Simpson worked in; Simpson also played on Haggard’s sessions. (Session work on Haggard’s “Okie From Muskogee.”) [1960s–1970s[3][4][5]]

### Key Collaborators
- [[ken_nelson|Ken Nelson]] - Capitol Records producer who recruited Simpson to front a series of trucking‑song recordings after Merle Haggard declined, effectively shaping his recording career. (Albums and singles including “Roll, Truck, Roll,” “The Highway Patrol,” and related Capitol truck‑driving releases.) [Mid‑1960s–early 1970s[1][4][5]]
- [[merle_haggard|Merle Haggard]] - Collaborated with Simpson in the studio; Simpson contributed as a musician to key Haggard recordings within the Bakersfield Sound. (Played on Haggard’s 1969 hit “Okie From Muskogee.”) [Late 1960s[3][4]]
- [[buck_owens|Buck Owens]] - Part of the same Bakersfield circle; Simpson wrote songs that Owens recorded and often worked in the same clubs and bands early on. (Songwriting contributions for Owens (various titles noted in obituaries and scene histories).) [1960s–1970s[3][4][5]]
- [[lorraine_walden|Lorraine Walden]] - Duet partner with whom Simpson recorded trucking‑themed male‑female songs. (Duets including “Truck Driver Man and Wife.”) [Circa 1977[1]]
- [[capitol_records_session_musicians_bakersfield_players|Capitol Records session musicians (Bakersfield players)]] - Regular collaborators who helped realize Simpson’s Telecaster‑driven Bakersfield sound on his Capitol albums. (Albums such as Roll, Truck, Roll; The Man Behind the Badge; Truck Drivin’ Fool; A Bakersfield Dozen; I’m a Truck; Country Western Truck Drivin’ Singer; Truckers Christmas.) [Mid‑1960s–mid‑1970s[4][5]]

### Artists Influenced
- [[later_bakersfieldinfluenced_country_artists_e.g._dwight_yoakam_brad_paisley_clint_black|Later Bakersfield‑influenced country artists (e.g., Dwight Yoakam, Brad Paisley, Clint Black)]] - While they did not study directly under Simpson, writers on the Bakersfield Sound identify his work—alongside Buck Owens and Merle Haggard—as part of the twanging West Coast tradition that shaped these artists’ approaches to tone, groove, and working‑class themes. (General stylistic influence heard in Yoakam’s Bakersfield‑styled honky‑tonk, Paisley’s Telecaster‑driven sound, and Clint Black’s neotraditional country, all of which draw on the Bakersfield lineage in which Simpson was a key contributor.) [1980s–2000s and beyond[5]]
- [[truckdriving_country_performers_and_songwriters|Truck‑driving country performers and songwriters]] - Simpson’s vivid, sometimes humorous trucking narratives helped define the truck‑driving subgenre alongside Dave Dudley, Red Sovine, and C.W. McCall, influencing how later artists portrayed truckers in country music. (Subsequent truck songs referencing life on the road, CB culture, and the mythic long‑haul driver owe a debt to hits like “Roll, Truck, Roll,” “The Highway Patrol,” and “I’m a Truck.”) [Late 1960s onward[3][5]]
