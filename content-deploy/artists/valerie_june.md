## Biography
Valerie June Hockett, born in Jackson, Tennessee, grew up in a musically rich and hardworking family environment, with her father working as both a construction company owner and a music promoter. Early exposure to gospel music in both Black and white churches, as well as her father's involvement in promoting local gospel acts, deeply influenced her formative years. After her family's home burned down when she was 14, June's resilience and creativity were further shaped by hardship and a strong sense of connection to the land and her roots. 

June moved to Memphis as a teenager to pursue her musical ambitions, immersing herself in the city's vibrant scene. She taught herself guitar, banjo, and ukulele, developing a unique sound she calls 'organic moonshine roots music,' which blends elements of folk, country, blues, gospel, soul, and Americana. Her early career involved self-released recordings and collaborations, notably with Old Crow Medicine Show, before her breakthrough with the critically acclaimed 2013 album 'Pushin’ Against a Stone,' produced by Dan Auerbach and Kevin Augunas and featuring Booker T. Jones. June's music is celebrated for its genre-defying eclecticism, distinctive vocals, and deeply personal songwriting, drawing comparisons to artists like Joni Mitchell and Van Morrison.

Throughout her career, June has continued to expand her artistic reach, working as an author, poet, and mindfulness instructor, and contributing songs to projects by other notable musicians such as Mavis Staples. Her legacy is marked by her refusal to be confined by traditional musical categories, her advocacy for creative freedom, and her influence on the modern Americana and roots music landscape.
