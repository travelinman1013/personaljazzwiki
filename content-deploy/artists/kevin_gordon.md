## Biography
Kevin Gordon is an acclaimed Americana, alt-country, and roots rock singer-songwriter known for his evocative storytelling and poetic lyricism. Born and raised in Monroe, Louisiana, Gordon's early years were shaped by the musical traditions of the American South, including rock, blues, honky-tonk, and rockabilly, as well as the rebellious energy of punk rock. He began his musical journey performing in high school punk bands, covering acts like the Ramones and Sex Pistols, before a gift of a guitar and exposure to the literate songwriting of bands like X inspired him to fuse his love of poetry and music.

Gordon pursued his passion for writing at the University of Iowa Writers’ Workshop, earning a master’s degree in poetry while immersing himself in the Midwest music scene. He played guitar in a touring band led by Bo Ramsey before forming his own group and developing a unique songwriting voice that draws deeply from his Louisiana roots. Relocating to Tennessee in the early 1990s, Gordon released his debut nationally distributed album, 'Cadillac Jack’s #1 Son,' in 1998, produced by Garry Tallent of the E Street Band. Over a career spanning more than two decades, Gordon has built a reputation for dynamic live performances and critically acclaimed albums such as 'Gloryland' and 'Long Gone Time.'

Gordon's music is celebrated for its narrative depth, blending Southern Gothic themes with rock and roll energy. His songs have been recorded by artists like Keith Richards, Irma Thomas, Levon Helm, and Hard Working Americans, and he has collaborated with notable musicians including Lucinda Williams. Surviving a battle with throat cancer during the making of his 2022 album 'The In Between,' Gordon continues to influence the Americana and roots music landscape with his distinctive voice and literary songwriting.
