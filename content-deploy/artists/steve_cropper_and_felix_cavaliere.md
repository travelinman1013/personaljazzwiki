## Biography
Steve Cropper & Felix Cavaliere is a collaborative pairing of two pivotal “blue‑eyed soul” figures whose joint work unites Memphis soul with East Coast R&B. Cropper, born in 1941 in Dora, Missouri and raised around Memphis, became famous as the guitarist, songwriter, producer, and in‑house A&R man at Stax Records, co‑founding Booker T. & the M.G.’s and playing on or helping shape classic recordings by Otis Redding, Wilson Pickett, Sam & Dave, and many others.[1][8] Cavaliere, born November 29, 1942 in Pelham, New York, came to prominence as co‑lead vocalist and Hammond organ player for The Young Rascals (later The Rascals), co‑writing and singing on 1960s hits such as “Good Lovin’,” “Groovin’,” and “People Got to Be Free,” which helped define a strand of soulful, socially aware pop‑rock.[3][4]

Although they moved in overlapping circles of 1960s and 1970s soul and rock, Cropper and Cavaliere did not become a recording team until much later in their careers. After decades of individual work—as Cropper continued with session, production, and solo projects and Cavaliere pursued solo albums, production, and ongoing Rascals‑related touring—they joined forces for the album **“Nudge It Up a Notch,”** released on Stax Records on July 29, 2008.[1][3][6] Marketed as a meeting of “renowned guitarist and R&B legend” Steve Cropper and “vocal/keyboard legend” Felix Cavaliere, the record drew specifically on the blend of tight, groove‑based Memphis rhythm guitar and organ‑driven, melody‑rich East Coast soul.[1][6] The collaboration was successful enough that they reconvened for a second album, **“Midnight Flyer,”** released by Stax in 2010, again emphasizing the crossroads of Southern and Northern blue‑eyed soul traditions.[1]

Their joint work is characterized by warm Hammond‑organ textures, concise, hook‑laden guitar lines, and songcraft rooted in classic R&B structures but presented with veteran polish. Critics and biographical sources frame the partnership as a late‑career summit between two artists who had already shaped the language of white American soul: Cropper through his role in virtually every significant Stax release from 1961–1970, and Cavaliere through The Rascals’ string of chart hits and later honors, including induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame.[1][3][4][8] Together under the “Steve Cropper & Felix Cavaliere” billing, they extend their legacies by revisiting and refreshing the classic soul vocabulary they helped create, rather than attempting a stylistic reinvention.
