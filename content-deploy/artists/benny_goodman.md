## Biography
Benjamin David Goodman, born on May 30, 1909, in Chicago, Illinois, to Polish Jewish immigrant parents, grew up as the ninth of twelve children in poverty-stricken conditions. At age 10, he began studying clarinet at the Kehelah Jacob Synagogue and with Franz Schoepp of the Chicago Symphony, quickly advancing through Hull-House bands and making his professional debut in 1921. By 14, he joined the American Federation of Musicians, quit school, and played in local bands, supporting his family after his father's death. In 1925, at 16, he joined Ben Pollack's band in Los Angeles, recording his first solo and becoming a featured artist until moving to New York in 1929 for studio work, radio, and Broadway, collaborating with jazz greats like Fats Waller and Bessie Smith.[1][2][3][4][5]

Goodman's career exploded in 1934 when he formed his own orchestra, using Fletcher Henderson's arrangements, and secured spots on NBC's *Let's Dance* and Billy Rose's Music Hall. His 1935 Palomar Ballroom performance ignited the swing era, yielding hits like 'Moonglow' with bandmates including Gene Krupa, Harry James, Ziggy Elman, Jess Stacy, and later Teddy Wilson and Lionel Hampton, forming one of the first racially integrated jazz groups. In 1938, his legendary Carnegie Hall concert, featuring Count Basie and Duke Ellington, marked jazz's mainstream breakthrough, with 'Sing, Sing, Sing' becoming a signature tune. His style blended precise big band swing rooted in ragtime and Dixieland with virtuoso clarinet work, bridging jazz and classical influences from Mozart, Debussy, and Brahms.[1][2][3][5]

Goodman continued leading bands into the mid-1940s, pursued classical interests, and performed until his death on June 13, 1986, in Manhattan from a heart attack. Known as the 'King of Swing,' he launched careers for many musicians and broke racial barriers, while his small groups like the Trio with Krupa and Wilson showcased potent jazz improvisation. His perfectionism and complex personality drove relentless innovation, including early 'Third Stream' fusion of jazz and classical.[1][2][3]
