## Biography
Pokey LaFarge, born Andrew Heissler in Bloomington, Illinois, is an acclaimed singer-songwriter whose music is deeply rooted in Americana, bluegrass, blues, and early jazz traditions. Raised in Normal, Illinois, LaFarge was influenced by his grandfather, a banjo player, who gifted him one of his first instruments. His childhood was marked by a love of history and literature, drawing inspiration from figures like John Steinbeck and Ernest Hemingway, which later infused his songwriting with vivid storytelling and a sense of nostalgia[1][4].

LaFarge began his musical journey as a teenager, trading his guitar for a mandolin at age 16 and busking across the United States. After high school, he hitchhiked around the country, absorbing musical styles and experiences that would shape his unique sound. His debut album, 'Marmalade,' was released in 2006, followed by a string of critically acclaimed records that showcased his blend of blues, country, folk, and jazz. Notably, he signed with Jack White's Third Man Records in 2013, further elevating his profile in the roots music scene[1][5].

Throughout his career, LaFarge has performed internationally, appeared in films and television (including 'The Lone Ranger' and 'Sun Records'), and contributed to soundtracks such as HBO's 'Boardwalk Empire.' His music is characterized by vintage instrumentation, literate lyrics, and a commitment to preserving and innovating American musical traditions. LaFarge's legacy lies in his ability to bridge past and present, inspiring a new generation of roots musicians while remaining a distinctive voice in contemporary Americana[3][5].
