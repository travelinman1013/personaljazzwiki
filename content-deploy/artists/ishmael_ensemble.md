## Biography
Ishmael Ensemble is a Bristol-based experimental jazz collective formed in 2017 by producer, saxophonist, and bandleader Pete Cunningham, who hails from a small town 12 miles south of Bristol. Growing up in a musically rich environment, Cunningham was influenced by his father's folk music and instrument collection, joining his first band at age nine with future ensemble member Jake Spurgeon, covering tracks like Muse and Alicia Keys. By his early teens, he immersed himself in Bristol's vibrant scene, DJing at free parties, attending dubstep nights like Pinch’s Dubloaded, and St Paul’s Carnival, which shaped his eclectic style blending jazz, electronica, dub, and psychedelia.[1][2][3][6]

Starting as a bedroom recording project and solo endeavor, Cunningham expanded Ishmael Ensemble into a live band after touring revealed the need for more hands, enlisting longtime collaborators Stephen Mullins on guitar, Jake Spurgeon on keys/bass/synths, Rory O'Gorman on drums, and vocalist Holly Wellington (aka Holysseus Fly). Their debut EP 'Songs for Knotty' (2017) and album 'A State Of Flow' (2019) garnered attention for lush cinematic and psychedelic soundscapes, followed by the critically acclaimed 'Visions of Light' (2021), named BBC 6 Music Album of the Year by Huey Morgan and The Guardian's Album of the Month. Their third album 'Rituals' (2024) pushed boundaries with epic, cinematic expansions post-lockdown touring.[1][2][3][4][8]

Rooted in Bristol's DIY ethic and history—from Massive Attack's hip-hop drone to dub and experimental nights—the ensemble defies 'new UK jazz' labels, fusing live instrumentation with electronic elements. They've performed at festivals like New York Winter Jazz Fest, contributed to Blue Note Re:imagined with a cover of McCoy Tyner's 'Search For Peace,' and earned praise from artists like Caribou and Carl Craig, establishing a legacy in the thriving UK jazz-electronica scene.[2][4][5]
