## Biography
Jamie Lynn Vessels, originally from Raleigh, North Carolina, grew up immersed in folk rock and singer-songwriter music, influenced by artists like Sheryl Crow, Beth Hart, and Brandi Carlile. She began with childhood piano lessons, picked up the guitar at age 10 under a 'rock and roll guy with long red hair' teacher, and formed her first band with neighborhood kids. Despite her passion, she pursued academics, earning undergraduate and Master's degrees in Criminal Justice, including grad school in Massachusetts, before music's pull led her to New Orleans, her artistic home.[1][2][5]

In New Orleans, Vessels developed her signature **New Orleans Roots Rock** style—a potent blend of blues rock, Americana, soul, and folk, characterized by raw, honest lyrics tackling addiction, loss, hope, and social issues, paired with powerful guitar riffs on cigar box and standard guitars. Her voice, described as 'sweet as it is raw,' and commanding live presence have built a dedicated community. Key releases include the album *If I’m Being Honest* with tracks like “Damn Dirty Demons,” “Eulogy at Joshua Tree,” and “Pulse,” plus singles like 'Shadowboxer' and charting album *Storm Coming*. She performs at festivals like New Orleans Jazz Fest, French Quarter Fest, and Cigar Box Guitar Festivals.[1][2]

Vessels collaborates with a core band of three players who add their flavor to her songs, starting from her demos or spontaneous jams. Nominated for OffBeat's Best of the Beat Awards (Best Roots Rock Artist/Album 2018, Best Emerging Artist 2015), she has opened for acts like Christone 'KINGFISH' Ingram and No Sinner, and served as lead guitarist for projects like Maid of Orleans (2016-2017) and N.O.B.A.B.E. (2018-2022).[1]
