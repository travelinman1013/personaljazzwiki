## Biography
Dakota Staton was born on June 3, 1930, in the Homewood neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. She began singing at a young age, entertaining neighbors and performing with her sisters, and later took classical voice lessons at the Filion School of Music. Her professional career started in her teens when she joined the Joe Westray Orchestra, a leading Pittsburgh band, and soon she was performing in jazz clubs across the Midwest, including Detroit, Indianapolis, Cleveland, and St. Louis.

Staton's big break came after moving to New York in the early 1950s, where her performances at Harlem's Baby Grand club caught the attention of Capitol Records producer Dave Cavanaugh. She signed with Capitol and quickly rose to prominence, winning Down Beat magazine’s 'Most Promising Newcomer' award in 1955. Her 1957 debut album, 'The Late, Late Show,' featuring arrangements by Van Alexander and trumpet by Jonah Jones, became a significant hit, with the title track reaching number 4 on the charts and remaining in print for over a decade. Staton's style was marked by her rich, soulful vocals and a blend of jazz, blues, and R&B influences, drawing comparisons to Dinah Washington and admired for her ability to cross genre boundaries.

Though never achieving the widespread fame of some contemporaries, Staton remained a respected and influential figure in vocal jazz for decades. She continued recording and performing into the 2000s, inspiring a generation of African-American female vocalists who sought to blend jazz sophistication with popular appeal. Staton's legacy endures through her dynamic recordings and her impact on the evolution of jazz and soul singing.
