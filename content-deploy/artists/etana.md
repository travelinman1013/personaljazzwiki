## Biography
Etana, born Shauna McKenzie on May 22, 1983, in Kingston, Jamaica, grew up in the eastern Saint Andrew community of August Town as the only girl among several brothers. Her early immersion in Jamaica's rich musical culture shaped her artistic aspirations, though her family initially encouraged her to pursue practical education. She attended school in Jamaica until approximately 1992, when she relocated to Florida for further education and eventually pursued a nursing degree at college. However, her passion for music proved undeniable, leading her to abandon her nursing career path and return to Jamaica with initial plans to open an internet cafe.

Etana's professional music career began unexpectedly when she was recommended by a friend to serve as a backup vocalist for reggae star Richie Spice, an experience she thoroughly enjoyed and credited with building her confidence as a performer. While working as a background vocalist, she created enough buzz that 5th Element management encouraged her to pursue a solo career. She recorded two songs—"Time" and "Wrong Address"—with the latter becoming her formal introduction to the reggae mainstream in 2006. "Wrong Address," a thought-provoking fusion of jazz and reggae that addressed unemployment and violence in Jamaican communities, achieved #1 status on numerous reggae charts and received heavy rotation throughout Jamaica and the Caribbean. This breakthrough was followed by another major hit, "Roots," which became an anthem among reggae fans with its powerful message about authenticity and cultural foundation.

Etana's 2008 debut album, *The Strong One*—released on VP Records and sharing her professional name meaning "The Strong One" in Swahili—established her as a formidable force in contemporary reggae. The album's blend of roots reggae, soul, R&B, and world music elements earned critical acclaim and numerous awards, including a MOBO Award nomination for best reggae. She continued her trajectory as a trailblazer, becoming the first female artist to achieve a reggae Billboard #1 in seventeen years with her album *I Rise*, produced by legendary Jamaican producer Clive Hunt. As a two-time Grammy-nominated artist with subsequent albums including *Reggae Forever* (2018) and *Pamoja* (2021), Etana has solidified her legacy as the leading contemporary female voice in reggae music, consistently delivering uplifting messages of empowerment, unconditional love, and social consciousness.

## Fun Facts
- Etana quit a prefabricated female vocal group called Gift on the spot during a music video shoot because she objected to the group's presentation, which involved skimpy clothes and invasive camera angles—a decision that ultimately led her to pursue her solo career path.
- Before becoming a reggae sensation, Etana initially planned to open an internet cafe upon returning to Jamaica, but was redirected to music when a friend recommended her as a backup vocalist for Richie Spice.
- Her professional name 'Etana' means 'The Strong One' in Swahili, a title that reflects her artistic identity and has become synonymous with her message of empowerment and resilience throughout her career.
- Etana made history as the first female reggae artist to achieve a Billboard #1 in seventeen years with her album *I Rise*, breaking significant gender barriers in a genre historically dominated by male artists.
