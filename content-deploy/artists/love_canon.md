## Biography
Love Canon is a progressive bluegrass band formed in 2010 in Charlottesville, Virginia, by guitarist and vocalist Jesse Harper and banjoist Adam Larrabee. The group quickly expanded to include Andy Thacker on mandolin, Darrell Muller on bass, and Jay Starling on resonator guitar, with occasional contributions from fiddlers such as Nate Leath and Alex Hargreaves. Emerging from the musical foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, Love Canon built a reputation for their virtuosic string playing and inventive arrangements, blending the acoustic traditions of bluegrass with the pop and electronic hits of the 1980s and 1990s.[1][2][5][6]

Rather than simply covering classic pop songs, Love Canon reimagines them through a bluegrass lens, infusing each track with intricate picking, tight harmonies, and a playful spirit. Their fourth album, 'Cover Story,' debuted at #1 on Billboard's Top Bluegrass Chart and features bluegrass reinterpretations of songs by Peter Gabriel, Billy Joel, Depeche Mode, and Paul Simon, among others. The band is known for energetic live performances and has appeared at major festivals, as well as collaborating with a wide range of artists both in the studio and on stage.[2][3][8]

Love Canon's legacy lies in their ability to bridge genres and generations, making bluegrass accessible to new audiences while honoring the genre's instrumental prowess. Their innovative approach has garnered a dedicated fanbase and critical acclaim, positioning them as leaders in the 'newgrass' movement and as ambassadors for acoustic reinterpretations of pop culture classics.[1][2][3]
