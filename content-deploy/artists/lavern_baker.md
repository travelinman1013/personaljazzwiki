## Biography
LaVern Baker, born Delores LaVern Evans (also known as Delores Williams) on November 11, 1929, in Chicago, Illinois, emerged as one of the most influential rhythm-and-blues vocalists of the 1950s and early 1960s[3][6]. Raised in a musical family and influenced by her aunt, the legendary blues guitarist Memphis Minnie, Baker began singing in her church choir before performing in Chicago clubs as a teenager[2][5]. She adopted stage names such as Little Miss Sharecropper and Bea Baker, developing a reputation for her powerful, expressive voice and dynamic stage presence[1][2].

Her career accelerated after joining Todd Rhodes and His Orchestra in 1952, leading to a solo contract with Atlantic Records in 1953[2][5]. Baker's exuberant delivery and ability to blend blues, jazz, and R&B produced a string of hits, including "Tweedlee Dee," "Jim Dandy," and "I Cried a Tear"[1][3][4]. She was one of the first female R&B artists to cross over to the pop charts, helping to shape the emerging sound of rock and roll[1][4]. Despite setbacks from white artists covering her songs, Baker's artistry remained undiminished, as evidenced by her jazz tribute album "LaVern Baker Sings Bessie Smith" (1958)[3].

In the late 1960s, Baker moved to the Philippines, where she worked as an entertainment director for the U.S. military for over two decades[1]. She returned to the U.S. in the late 1980s, performing at major events and starring on Broadway, before her death in New York City on March 10, 1997[1][3]. Baker's legacy endures through her pioneering role in R&B and rock and roll, her induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1991, and her influence on generations of vocalists[3][4].
