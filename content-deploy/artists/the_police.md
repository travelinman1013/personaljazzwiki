## Biography
The Police were an English rock band formed in London in 1977, built around the core trio of **Sting** (Gordon Sumner, lead vocals and bass), **Stewart Copeland** (drums and percussion), and **Andy Summers** (guitar). Emerging from the British new wave and late‑1970s punk scenes, they drew on the prior experience of their members: Copeland had played progressive rock with Curved Air, Sting had led jazz‑influenced groups in Newcastle, and Summers was a seasoned guitarist from British rhythm‑and‑blues and rock outfits.[1][4] Initially formed by Copeland with Sting and original guitarist Henry Padovani, the band soon solidified into the classic trio when Summers replaced Padovani later in 1977.[1][3][4] Their debut album *Outlandos d’Amour* (1978) introduced a lean, edgy sound and yielded breakthrough singles like “Roxanne” and “Can’t Stand Losing You,” quickly establishing the group on both the UK and US charts.[1][4]

Over the next few years, The Police became one of the defining bands of the early 1980s, known for a distinctive blend of rock with **punk energy, reggae rhythms, jazz and world‑music influences**, and literate, often darkly ironic lyrics.[1][4] Albums such as *Reggatta de Blanc* (1979), *Zenyatta Mondatta* (1980), and *Ghost in the Machine* (1981) expanded their sonic palette from sparse, guitar‑driven arrangements to more layered, atmospheric productions, while still foregrounding Summers’s textural guitar work, Copeland’s polyrhythmic drumming, and Sting’s high‑tenor vocals and songwriting.[1][4] Their commercial and artistic peak came with *Synchronicity* (1983), a multi‑platinum global hit whose singles—including “Every Breath You Take”—helped make them, in the eyes of many critics, the biggest rock band in the world and a leading force in the so‑called “Second British Invasion” of the US charts.[1][4]

Tensions within the group grew alongside their success, and The Police ceased recording together after the mid‑1980s, effectively disbanding in 1984 (with some sources noting 1986 as the final break) following a last studio visit that produced a re‑recorded “Don’t Stand So Close to Me ’86.”[1][2] They briefly reunited for select performances, most notably for their induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2003 and a major world tour in 2007–2008, but the members have primarily pursued solo and other projects since their heyday.[1][2] Despite a relatively compact catalog of five studio albums, The Police left a lasting legacy: multiple Grammy Awards, massive global sales, and a profound influence on subsequent rock, pop, and alternative artists who drew on their hybrid of reggae‑tinged grooves, sophisticated songcraft, and tight power‑trio dynamics.[1][2][4]

## Fun Facts
- The Police dyed their hair blond for a TV commercial—done to portray a punk band—which unintentionally created their signature visual look and helped distinguish them in the new wave scene.[4]
- Despite later being hailed as one of the world’s biggest rock bands, The Police were initially dismissed by some punk and new wave purists, and influential BBC DJ John Peel turned down a session with them, later saying he did not rate them at all.[2][6]
- The band’s name and image often led to them being perceived as a straight punk act at first, but all three core members were already highly trained and experienced musicians before forming the group, unlike many of their punk contemporaries.[4]
- Stewart Copeland’s behind‑the‑scenes Super‑8 film footage of the band’s early years was later turned into the documentary *Everyone Stares: The Police Inside Out*, which was shown at the Sundance Film Festival and helped catalyze their 2007 reunion.[5]

## Musical Connections

### Mentors/Influences
- [[reggae_and_jamaican_popular_music|Reggae and Jamaican popular music]] - Core stylistic influence on the band’s rhythmic feel and guitar/drum approach, especially in their early work, where they fused rock with reggae off‑beat accents and dub‑like textures. (Albums *Outlandos d’Amour* and *Reggatta de Blanc*; songs such as “Roxanne,” “Can’t Stand Losing You,” and “Walking on the Moon.”) [Late 1970s–early 1980s[1][4]]
- [[punk_rock_and_the_1970s_london_punk_scene|Punk rock and the 1970s London punk scene]] - Stewart Copeland deliberately formed The Police to participate in the emerging London punk movement, shaping their early image, tempo, and stripped‑down sound even as their musicianship exceeded most punk peers. (Early single “Fall Out”; much of *Outlandos d’Amour* reflects punk‑inspired energy and brevity.) [1977–1979[1][3][4]]
- [[jazz_and_jazzrock_fusion|Jazz and jazz‑rock fusion]] - Sting’s background playing jazz and fusion in Newcastle informed the band’s harmonic language, melodic bass lines, and willingness to incorporate complex chords and rhythmic subtleties. (Sting’s pre‑Police band Last Exit; later Police albums such as *Ghost in the Machine* and *Synchronicity* show more overt jazz‑tinged harmony.) [Pre‑1977 background, then throughout Police recordings[1][4]]

### Key Collaborators
- [[sting_gordon_sumner|Sting (Gordon Sumner)]] - Founding member, lead vocalist, bassist, and primary songwriter; central creative force in The Police’s music and lyrics. (All five studio albums: *Outlandos d’Amour*, *Reggatta de Blanc*, *Zenyatta Mondatta*, *Ghost in the Machine*, *Synchronicity*.) [1977–1984; reunions in 1992, 2003, 2007–2008[1]]
- [[stewart_copeland|Stewart Copeland]] - Founder and drummer; initiated the band after his tenure in Curved Air and brought a distinctive, polyrhythmic drumming style and considerable organizational drive. (All Police studio albums and major tours; contributed compositions such as “On Any Other Day” and co‑shaped arrangements.) [1977–1984; reunions in 1992, 2003, 2007–2008[1][4][5]]
- [[andy_summers|Andy Summers]] - Guitarist who replaced original member Henry Padovani; his atmospheric, effects‑laden guitar and sophisticated voicings became a hallmark of the band’s sound. (All studio albums from *Outlandos d’Amour* onward; signature guitar work on hits like “Message in a Bottle” and “Every Breath You Take.”) [Joined 1977; core member 1977–1984; reunions 1992, 2003, 2007–2008[1][3][4]]
- [[henry_padovani|Henry Padovani]] - Original guitarist who helped Copeland and Sting launch the band and played on their debut single before being replaced. (Single “Fall Out” and early live performances.) [1977[1][3]]
- [[miles_and_ian_copeland|Miles and Ian Copeland]] - Stewart Copeland’s brothers; Miles managed The Police and helped drive their touring and business strategy, while Ian was involved in their early logistics and promotion. (Early management, touring strategy, and support for the band’s rise from UK clubs to global arenas.) [Late 1970s–early 1980s[5]]

### Artists Influenced
- [[1980s_and_1990s_alternative_rock_and_new_wave_bands_e.g._u2_r.e.m._and_others_often_cited_alongside_the_police|1980s and 1990s alternative rock and new wave bands (e.g., U2, R.E.M., and others often cited alongside The Police)]] - The Police’s combination of atmospheric guitar textures, agile rhythm sections, and thoughtful songwriting became a template for many post‑punk and alternative acts; they are widely cited as one of the first new‑wave bands to achieve major mainstream success, opening doors for others. (Influence heard broadly in 1980s ‘Second British Invasion’ and college‑rock scenes, where bands adopted reggae‑inflected grooves and spacious guitar work similar to Police records.) [Mid‑1980s onward[1][2][4]]
- [[later_reggaerock_and_hybrid_poprock_artists|Later reggae‑rock and hybrid pop‑rock artists]] - By successfully blending reggae, punk, jazz, and pop into chart‑topping hits, The Police provided a commercial and stylistic model for later acts that fused Caribbean rhythms with rock and pop. (The band’s catalog, especially tracks like “Walking on the Moon,” “So Lonely,” and “Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic,” became reference points for genre‑blending pop‑rock.) [1980s–2000s[1][4]]
