## Biography
Willie West, born Millard Leon West on December 8, 1941, in Raceland, Louisiana, is a celebrated soul and blues vocalist whose career is deeply intertwined with the musical legacy of New Orleans. Growing up in a region rich with musical influences, West was inspired by R&B, blues, and early rock 'n' roll, listening to artists like Eddie Bo, B.B. King, Bobby Blue Bland, and Guitar Slim. He formed his first band, The Sharks, at age 15 with his cousin and quickly became known for his energetic performances and versatile voice, performing in both black and white clubs throughout the bayou region. His first single, 'Did You Have Fun,' released in 1959, became a regional hit and marked the beginning of a recording career that would span decades.[1][2][3][4]

In the early 1960s, West moved to New Orleans, where he became a fixture in the city's vibrant music scene, performing with groups like Edgar Blanchard and the Gondoliers, Deacon John and the Ivories, and Oliver and the Rockettes. His collaborations with legendary producer Allen Toussaint led to a string of singles on labels such as Deesu and Josie, often backed by The Meters, New Orleans' premier funk band. West's powerful, emotive voice and dynamic stage presence earned him a reputation as a genuine soul survivor, though widespread commercial success eluded him. He continued to perform regularly on Bourbon Street and remained active in the local scene, eventually releasing his debut full-length album, 'From West With Love,' in 1999, followed by several more albums into the 2000s.[1][2][3][4]

Willie West's musical style blends deep soul, blues, and New Orleans funk, characterized by heartfelt vocals and a flair for showmanship. Though not a household name, his recordings are revered by soul aficionados, and his influence resonates through his collaborations and mentorship within the New Orleans music community. His legacy endures as a testament to the enduring power and authenticity of Southern soul and blues.[1][2][3][4]
