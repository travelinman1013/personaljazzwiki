## Biography
O-Zone was a Moldovan Eurodance group and boy band formed in 1999, originally as a duo consisting of Dan Bălan and Petru Jelihovschi. After Jelihovschi's departure, Bălan held auditions and eventually formed the official trio lineup with Radu Sîrbu and Arsenie Todiraș. The group moved to Bucharest, Romania, in 2002 to expand their reach, quickly gaining popularity with their upbeat pop sound and energetic performances. Their breakthrough came with the single 'Despre Tine,' which topped Romanian charts, but it was 'Dragostea din tei' that catapulted them to international fame, topping charts across Europe and becoming a global phenomenon in 2003–2004. The song's viral success was further amplified by the 'Numa Numa Dance' internet meme, which introduced O-Zone to a new generation of fans. After disbanding in 2005, the members pursued solo careers, though the group reunited for select concerts in 2017 and 2019. In 2024, O-Zone announced a summer tour as a tribute band, with Arsenie Todiraș as the sole singer and two dancers.

O-Zone's musical style blended Europop and Eurodance, characterized by catchy melodies, danceable beats, and multilingual lyrics. Their legacy is defined by 'Dragostea din tei,' which has sold over 12 million copies worldwide and remains one of the most recognizable Europop hits of the 2000s. The group's influence extends beyond their chart success, as their music continues to inspire covers, remixes, and internet culture, cementing their place in pop music history.
