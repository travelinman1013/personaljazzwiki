## Biography
Mikio Masuda (益田 幹夫), also known as Mickey Masuda, is a Japanese jazz and jazz fusion keyboardist born on August 14, 1949, in Osaka, Japan. Largely self-taught, Masuda began his musical journey playing bass at age 16 before switching to piano and performing in various clubs throughout Osaka. In 1969, he relocated to Tokyo, where he became an integral part of the burgeoning Japanese jazz scene of the early 1970s.

Masuda's career flourished through collaborations with some of Japan's most prominent jazz musicians, including performances in a quartet with Motohiko Hino, Shunzo Ohno, and Terumasa Hino. His international breakthrough came in 1973 when he performed at the International New Jazz Meeting at Burg Altena, Germany. He recorded his debut album "Trace" for East Wind Records in 1974, followed by the jazz-fusion album "Mickey's Mouth" in 1976, which showcased his crossover sound after forming his own fusion group. Moving to New York City in 1978, Masuda expanded his musical horizons, recording the album "Corazón" and working with prominent American musicians. His later New York sessions produced notable trio albums including "Black Daffodils" (1996) with Ron Carter and Lewis Nash, and "Blue Dumplings" (1998) with Ron Carter and Grady Tate.

Masuda's musical style encompassed jazz, jazz fusion, soul, and funk, with his proficiency extending across piano, synthesizer, and organ. Between 1972 and 1998, he participated in 46 recording sessions, establishing himself as one of Japan's leading jazz pianists. His work bridged the gap between traditional jazz and the emerging fusion movement in Japan, contributing to the genre's development in the Asia-Pacific region during the 1970s and beyond.
