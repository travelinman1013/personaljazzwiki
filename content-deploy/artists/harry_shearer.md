## Biography
Harry Julius Shearer, born December 23, 1943, in Los Angeles, California, is a multifaceted American artist known for his work as an actor, comedian, musician, radio host, writer, and producer. The only child of Eastern European immigrants who survived the Holocaust, Shearer began his career as a child actor, appearing in films such as 'Abbott and Costello Go to Mars' (1953) and 'The Robe' (1953), as well as on 'The Jack Benny Program.'

Shearer’s career flourished in the late 1960s and 1970s as a member of The Credibility Gap, a radio comedy group that included Michael McKean. He later became a writer and performer on 'Saturday Night Live' and co-wrote the film 'Real Life' (1979) with Albert Brooks. Shearer achieved cult status as Derek Smalls, the bassist in the mockumentary 'This Is Spinal Tap' (1984), and continued to collaborate with McKean and Christopher Guest on musical comedy projects. Since 1983, he has hosted 'Le Show,' a public radio program blending satire, music, and sketch comedy. Shearer is perhaps most widely recognized for voicing 21 characters on 'The Simpsons,' including Mr. Burns, Ned Flanders, and Principal Skinner, earning him a Primetime Emmy Award in 2014.

Shearer’s musical style is rooted in satire and parody, often blending spoken word, comedy, and rock. His legacy spans decades of influential work in comedy, television, and music, making him a pivotal figure in American entertainment.
