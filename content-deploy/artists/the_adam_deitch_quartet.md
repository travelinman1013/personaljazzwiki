## Biography
The Adam Deitch Quartet is a jazz‑funk group led by Grammy‑nominated drummer, composer, and producer Adam Deitch, known for his work with Lettuce and Break Science.[2][3][4] Formed in the mid‑2010s and released through Deitch’s own Golden Wolf Records label, the Quartet features a core lineup of Deitch on drums, Bay Area Hammond organ specialist Wil Blades on organ and clavinet, and Lettuce horn section mainstays Ryan Zoidis (saxophones) and Eric “Benny” Bloom (trumpet).[1][2][4] Originating from Deitch’s base in Denver and his long‑standing New York/Boston funk‑jazz circles, the band grew out of late‑night after‑parties following Lettuce shows, where the four musicians developed a tightly grooving small‑group concept steeped in mid‑’60s soul‑jazz, classic organ‑combo funk, and modern hip‑hop–inflected rhythm playing.[3][4]

The Quartet’s recorded output, including albums like *Egyptian Secrets* and *Roll The Tape*, showcases Deitch’s evolution from high‑demand sideman and producer to bandleader in a straight‑ahead instrumental setting, often cutting tracks in one or two takes with minimal post‑production.[1][2][9] Critics have emphasized that the group is far more than a stripped‑down version of Lettuce: its music is built around Blades’s percolating Hammond organ, tight horn voicings from Zoidis and Bloom, and Deitch’s deep, syncopated grooves, evoking mid‑’60s Blue Note organ groups while incorporating funk, hip‑hop, and modern jazz sensibilities.[1][4][9] Guest collaborations with artists like guitarist John Scofield, Deitch’s longtime mentor, further cement the Quartet’s place at the intersection of contemporary funk, groove‑oriented jazz, and jam‑scene improvisation, and position the band as a vehicle for Deitch’s compositional voice and legacy within modern jazz‑funk.[2][4][9]

## Fun Facts
- The Adam Deitch Quartet began informally as a series of small after‑party gigs following Lettuce shows on the U.S. West Coast, before evolving into a full recording and touring project.[4]
- Adam Deitch releases the Quartet’s music on his own imprint, Golden Wolf Records, which he founded in 2014 specifically to support his solo and Quartet projects.[2]
- Many tracks by The Adam Deitch Quartet, including those on *Egyptian Secrets*, were recorded in just one or two takes with almost no effects or post‑production, emphasizing live ensemble interaction.[9]
- Although two of the Quartet’s members (Ryan Zoidis and Eric “Benny” Bloom) are best known for large‑ensemble funk with Lettuce, critics have stressed that the Adam Deitch Quartet is not simply a stripped‑down Lettuce but a distinct organ‑combo jazz‑funk group with its own sound.[1]
