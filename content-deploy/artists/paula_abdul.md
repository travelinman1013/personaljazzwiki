## Biography
Paula Abdul is an American singer, dancer, choreographer, actress, and television personality who rose to fame in the late 1980s as a pop star and choreographer. Born in San Fernando, California, she began her career as a cheerleader for the Los Angeles Lakers, quickly becoming head choreographer for the Laker Girls. Her choreography work in music videos for artists like Janet Jackson and ZZ Top established her as a sought-after talent in the industry. Abdul transitioned into music with her debut album, Forever Your Girl (1988), which produced four number one singles and became a multi-platinum success. Her second album, Spellbound (1991), also achieved global acclaim, while her third, Head Over Heels (1995), marked a shift in her musical direction. After a period of personal and professional challenges, Abdul found renewed fame as a judge on American Idol (2002–2009), where her supportive critiques became a hallmark of the show. She has since returned to music with tours and residencies, including her 2019 Las Vegas residency, Paula Abdul: Forever Your Girl, and co-headlined the 2024 Magic Summer Tour with New Kids on the Block.

Abdul's musical style blends pop, dance, and R&B, characterized by catchy melodies and energetic choreography. Her legacy is defined by her impact on music video choreography and her role in shaping the sound and look of late-1980s and early-1990s pop music. She has sold over 30 million albums worldwide and won a Grammy for her music video 'Opposites Attract.' Beyond music, Abdul has acted in television films and series, and her work as a judge and mentor on reality competition shows has cemented her status as a pop culture icon.
