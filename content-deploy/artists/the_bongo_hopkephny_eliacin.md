## Biography
Étienne Sevet, the founder and driving force behind The Bongo Hop, was born in Bordeaux, France, and grew up in a music-loving family. Initially pursuing a degree in political science, he self-taught trumpet without formal training and spent eight years in Cali, Colombia, working as a music journalist, DJ, promoter, and organizer of parties after discovering Pacific coast music while making a documentary on salsa. This period profoundly shaped his sound, blending Colombian folkloric traditions with West African rhythms he encountered through digging records like those of Johnny Bokelo and Amadou Balaké.[1][2][4][5]

Returning to France around 2011, Sevet settled in Lyon, where he formed The Bongo Hop as an Afro-Caribbean band, collaborating with producer Bruno Hovart (Patchworks) to realize his genre-defying vision. Inspired by British producer Quantic (Will Holland) to create his own music, he incorporated influences from travels to Tanzania, Cape Verde, and elsewhere, naming the project after the 'bongo hop' metaphor of hopping between cultures like an octopus on an accidental adventure. His style fuses trumpet-led compositions with Afro-Colombian, Caribbean biguine, semba, and global dance rhythms, resulting in albums like Satingarona Pt 1 (2019) and Pt 2, La Pata Coja, and others featuring multinational vocalists.[1][2][3][4]

The Bongo Hop's legacy lies in its perpetual dance music that bridges diasporic experiences, environmental themes, and immigrant stories, performed by an 8-piece multinational band from Cuba, Cameroon, France, Colombia, Senegal, and Benin. Sevet's journey from journalist to trumpeter-composer exemplifies cultural synthesis, with over 80 shows across Europe and ongoing explorations beyond frontiers.[4][6]

## Fun Facts

- The band draws from an 8-piece multinational lineup hailing from Cuba, Cameroon, France, Colombia, Senegal, and Benin, based in Lyon.
