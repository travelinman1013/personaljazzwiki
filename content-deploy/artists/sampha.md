## Biography
Sampha Lahai Sisay, known professionally as Sampha, was born on November 16, 1988, in Morden, South London, United Kingdom, to Sierra Leonean parents who immigrated to the UK in the 1980s. Growing up in a musically rich environment, he learned piano at home and was influenced by the diverse records shared by his older siblings, as well as the vibrant UK rave and jungle scenes of the 1990s. His early exposure to music production came through his brother’s home studio, and his creative journey accelerated after connecting with experimental producer Kwes via Myspace in 2007. Kwes became a mentor, introducing Sampha to a network of innovative London musicians and leading to an internship at the Young Turks label, where Sampha began remixing tracks and collaborating with emerging artists.

Sampha’s career gained momentum through collaborations with SBTRKT, Jessie Ware, and Lil Silva, and he established himself as a sought-after vocalist and producer for both underground and mainstream acts. His debut solo EPs, 'Sundanza' (2010) and 'Dual' (2013), showcased his emotive vocal style and experimental production. Sampha’s breakthrough came with his debut album 'Process' (2017), which was deeply influenced by the loss of his mother and won the prestigious Mercury Prize. His sophomore album 'Lahai' (2023) further explored themes of ancestry, spirituality, and fatherhood, blending West African folk with electronic and soul influences. Throughout his career, Sampha has been recognized for his soulful voice, introspective songwriting, and innovative fusion of genres, leaving a significant mark on contemporary indie soul and alternative R&B.
