## Biography
Aaron Joseph Neville was born on January 24, 1941, in New Orleans, Louisiana, to Arthur Neville, a merchant marine sailor, and his mother Amelia. Growing up in poverty, Aaron discovered his vocal talent early, singing his way into movies and basketball games. He learned his craft from the homemade doo-wop group that his older brother Art started with friends during the doo-wop era. However, his early career was derailed when he was arrested for car theft in 1958 and spent six months in prison—a wake-up call that motivated him to pursue music seriously. After prison, he married his sweetheart and began his solo career, though he struggled with heroin addiction and spent another year in prison for burglary before returning to New Orleans determined to succeed.

Neville's breakthrough came in 1966 with "Tell It Like It Is," which reached number two on the Billboard Hot 100 and topped the R&B chart for five weeks in 1967, selling over one million copies. Despite this success, he received no royalties and worked as a ditch digger and dockworker to support his family. After his mother's death in 1975, he overcame his addiction and reunited with his brothers Art, Charles, and Cyril to form the Neville Brothers in 1977. His career experienced a major renaissance in 1989 through collaborations with Linda Ronstadt on the album "Cry Like a Rainstorm, Howl Like the Wind," which produced the Grammy-winning number-one hits "Don't Know Much" and "All My Life." Throughout the 1990s, he achieved three consecutive RIAA platinum-selling albums and topped the Billboard Jazz chart with "Nature Boy: The Standards Album."

Renowned for his distinctively smooth, vibrato-heavy tenor voice, Neville's genre-crossing career spans R&B, soul, gospel, jazz, country, and pop. Of mixed African American, Native American, and European heritage, his music incorporates Cajun and Creole influences. He has earned four Grammy Awards, including a 2023 win for Best American Roots Performance for "Stompin' Ground" with the Dirty Dozen Brass Band. He has performed the national anthem at two Super Bowls, including a 2006 rendition alongside Aretha Franklin and Dr. John, and was named one of Rolling Stone's 200 Greatest Singers of All Time in 2023. His enduring influence across multiple musical genres, combined with his remarkable vocal refinement often compared to Sam Cooke, has cemented his legacy as one of America's most distinctive voices.

## Fun Facts
- NPR once described his voice as singing "like an angel who swallowed a wah-wah pedal," capturing the unique combination of his smooth tenor and distinctive vibrato.
- As a child growing up in poverty, he would sing his way into movies and basketball games for free admission, with whoever was at the door saying, 'All right, Neville, sing me a song, and I'll let you in.'
- Despite "Tell It Like It Is" reaching number two on the charts and selling over one million copies, Neville received no royalties—only a flat fee for the recording session—forcing him to work as a ditch digger and dockworker to support his family. His son recalled they were "eating mayonnaise sandwiches" and didn't even have a refrigerator, just an ice chest.
- He has performed the United States national anthem at the Super Bowl on two occasions, including a memorable 2006 performance alongside legendary artists Aretha Franklin and Dr. John.
