## Biography
Carrie Rodriguez is an acclaimed composer, violinist, and singer from Austin, Texas, celebrated for her dynamic fusion of Americana, alt-country, and Latin influences. Raised in a musically rich family—her father, David Rodriguez, was a noted Texas songwriter, and her great-aunt was the renowned Chicana singer Eva Garza—Carrie began playing violin at age five and made her first recording appearance on her father's 1992 album. Initially trained in classical violin, she attended Oberlin Conservatory before transferring to Berklee College of Music, where she embraced her Texas roots and developed her signature fiddle style.

Rodriguez's career took off after a pivotal collaboration with songwriter Chip Taylor, leading to several duet albums and launching her as a solo artist. She has released five solo studio albums, including the bilingual 'Lola,' which was praised as 'the perfect bicultural album' by NPR and Rolling Stone. Her music, often described as 'Ameri-Chicana,' blends fiery fiddle, emotive vocals, and a cross-pollination of genres. Beyond recording and touring internationally, Rodriguez has contributed to musical theater as the composer and lyricist for the off-Broadway musical '¡Americano!,' earning a 2022 Drama Desk Award nomination. She continues to champion Latinx culture through projects like her Laboratorio concert series in Austin.
