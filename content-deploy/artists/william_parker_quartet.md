# William Parker Quartet

## Biography
The William Parker Quartet is a jazz ensemble led by bassist William Parker, born January 10, 1952, in the Bronx, New York. Parker emerged as a major bandleader relatively late in his career, officially stepping out as a leader in 1994 with the In Order to Survive quartet before forming the William Parker Quartet, which became his primary vehicle for artistic expression in the 2000s. The quartet features drummer Hamid Drake, alto saxophonist Rob Brown, and trumpeter Lewis Barnes, creating a distinctive sound that bridges free improvisation with accessible melodic content. Parker's early life was shaped by study with legendary bassists including Jimmy Garrison, Richard Davis, and Wilbur Ware, though he received no formal classical training. He first gained public attention in the 1980s playing with pianist Cecil Taylor for over a decade, establishing himself as a virtuosic free jazz bassist before transitioning to leadership roles.

The William Parker Quartet achieved breakthrough recognition with their 2001 album O'Neal's Porch, which was included in Best of 2001 lists by The New York Times, DownBeat, and the Jazz Journalists Association. This album marked a significant artistic turn, presenting sunny melodies and infectious rhythmic interplay that made Parker's avant-garde sensibilities accessible to broader audiences. The following year, the quartet released Raining on the Moon (2002), featuring vocalist Leena Conquest performing Parker's original songs and lyrics, which reinvigorated the concept of jazz vocals with material that was simultaneously simple and profound. These albums demonstrated Parker's ability to synthesize free improvisation with driving folk forms and structured songwriting, earning him recognition as a major artist and leader of the contemporary avant-garde jazz scene.

Parker's legacy extends far beyond the quartet format. He has recorded over 40 albums as a leader and appeared on approximately 150 recordings, written six books, and founded multiple ensembles including the 17-piece Little Huey Creative Music Orchestra (active since 1981) and the cooperative Other Dimensions in Music. The Village Voice named him "the most consistently brilliant free jazz bassist of all time," while DownBeat called him "one of the most adventurous and prolific bandleaders in jazz." Beyond music, Parker is recognized as the "unofficial mayor of the New York improvisational scene" and serves as a dedicated mentor and educator, organizing the Vision Festival with his wife, dancer Patricia Nicholson.

## Fun Facts
- Parker's first instrument was trumpet, followed by trombone and cello, before he eventually settled on bass as his primary instrument—demonstrating his multi-instrumental versatility that would define his career.
- He is recognized as the 'unofficial mayor of the New York improvisational scene' and the 'free-jazz caretaker,' reflecting his deep community involvement and mentorship role beyond his own performances.
- Parker plays an extraordinary range of instruments beyond bass, including shakuhachi, bamboo flutes, tuba, double reeds, West African kora, gembri, and donso ngoni—an instrument first introduced to him by Don Cherry.
- The William Parker Quartet's breakthrough album O'Neal's Porch (2001) was so successful that it appeared on Best of 2001 lists simultaneously in The New York Times, DownBeat, and the Jazz Journalists Association, marking Parker's emergence as a major artist after decades of avant-garde work.
