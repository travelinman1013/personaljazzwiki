## Biography
Billy Cobham, born William Emanuel Cobham Jr. on May 16, 1944, in Panama City, Panama, was raised in Brooklyn, New York, where his early fascination with percussion began by age four, playing alongside his pianist father and inspired by his cousin's playing. He attended New York's High School of Music and Art, graduating in 1962, and served as a percussionist in the U.S. Army Band from 1965 to 1968. After discharge, he immersed himself in the New York jazz scene, joining Horace Silver's quintet in 1968, touring the U.S. and Europe, and freelancing with artists like Stanley Turrentine, Shirley Scott, and George Benson.[1][2][3][4][5][6]

Cobham's career exploded in the late 1960s and early 1970s as a pioneer of jazz fusion, blending jazz complexity with rock power and funk grooves. He contributed to Miles Davis's seminal fusion albums including Bitches Brew, Live-Evil, and A Tribute to Jack Johnson, then co-founded the Mahavishnu Orchestra with John McLaughlin in 1971, delivering virtuosic performances on The Inner Mounting Flame and Birds of Fire. In 1973, he launched his band Spectrum with Atlantic Records, featuring Spectrum (1973) and experimenting with electronic percussion alongside musicians like Jan Hammer, John Scofield, and Tommy Bolin. His muscular style, impeccable timing, and command of odd time signatures redefined drumming in fusion.[1][3][4][5][6]

Transitioning to commercial jazz in the mid-1970s with albums like A Funky Thide of Sings (1975), Cobham signed with CBS in 1977, pursued session work, and explored diverse projects including collaborations with Peter Gabriel, Brazilian jazz, and the Grateful Dead's Bobby & the Midnites. In 1998, he co-founded Jazz is Dead, jazzifying Grateful Dead tunes, and later released Drum’n’Voice series (1998-2009). Recognized as one of the 25 most influential drummers by Modern Drummer in 2001 and inducted into Classic Drummer Magazine's Hall of Fame in 1988, Cobham's innovative approach paved the way for fusion drummers, and since 2011, he has run an online drum academy.[2][3][6]
