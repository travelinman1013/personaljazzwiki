## Biography
Francis Bebey (15 July 1929 – 28 May 2001) was born in Douala, Cameroon, into a large family that valued education and culture. His father, a Protestant minister, encouraged academic pursuits, and Bebey initially studied mathematics before his passion for music led him to Paris and New York, where he pursued further studies in broadcasting and music. Early exposure to both Cameroonian folk traditions and classical guitar—particularly the work of Andrés Segovia—inspired Bebey to blend African rhythms with Western musical forms.[1][2][3][4][6]

Bebey's career was multifaceted: he worked as a broadcaster in Ghana, Paris, and New York, and from 1961 to 1974, he headed the music department at UNESCO in Paris, where he researched and documented traditional African music. He released his first album in 1969 and went on to produce over 20 albums, often performing all instrumentation himself. Bebey was a pioneer in integrating synthesizers, drum machines, and electric keyboards with traditional African instruments such as the sanza (thumb piano) and the n'dehou (Pygmy bamboo flute). His style merged Cameroonian makossa, bikutsi, classical guitar, jazz, pop, and electronic music, and he sang in Duala, English, and French.[2][3][4][5][6][7][8]

Bebey's legacy is profound: he is considered one of Africa's foremost songwriters and a father of world music, credited with globalizing African sounds and challenging stereotypes about African rhythms. He was also an acclaimed novelist, with works like "Agatha Moudio’s Son" earning major literary awards. His experimental approach, poetic lyrics, and advocacy for African musical traditions have inspired generations of musicians and scholars.[2][3][4][5][8]
