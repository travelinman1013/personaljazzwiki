## Biography
Esther Bigeou (c. 1892–1895 – November 15, 1936) was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, into one of the city's most musical families, as she was a cousin of renowned drummer Paul Barbarin.[1][5][7] Growing up in this rich musical environment, she developed an interest in performance, eventually becoming a prominent vaudeville and blues singer known for her captivating stage presence.[2][3][4]

Bigeou rose to fame in the vaudeville circuit, billed as 'The Girl with the Million Dollar Smile,' and was recognized as one of the classic female blues performers of her era.[3][4][6] Her style leaned more toward classic blues than the jazz traditions of her New Orleans roots, showcasing her versatility in blending vaudeville entertainment with emotive blues singing.[7][8] She performed extensively in the 1920s, recording a small number of tracks that captured her distinctive voice and charm.

Bigeou's career was cut short by her death in New Orleans on November 15, 1936, leaving behind a modest but influential legacy in early blues and vaudeville history.[1][2][5] Though not as widely recorded as contemporaries, her work exemplifies the vibrant female blues scene of the early 20th century.
