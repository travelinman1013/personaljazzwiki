## Biography
Female Species is a pioneering all‑female rock group formed in 1966 in Whittier, California, by teenage sisters **Vicki** and **Ronni Gossett**.[3][6] Inspired after seeing The Beatles on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1964, 16‑year‑old Vicki decided to start “a band that’s just like The Beatles, only it’s going to be all girls,” recruiting 14‑year‑old Ronni on bass, along with classmates Dawna Snow (keyboards), Linda Peters (guitar), and Michelle Molner (drums).[2][3][5] Their mother Loretta coined the name **Female Species**, while their father “Big Al” became their booking agent and road manager, driving the underage group to gigs at California military bases and local venues where they could legally perform.[3][5] Early on they avoided learning covers and instead wrote their own material, crafting melodic, organ‑driven garage‑pop and psychedelic‑tinged songs like “Tale of My Lost Love” and “You Need Me,” marked by Dawna Snow’s wild keyboard solos and Vicki’s smooth, melancholic vocals.[1][2]

Through the late 1960s and early 1970s Female Species evolved from peppy teen pop and garage rock into more explicitly psychedelic and then country‑leaning music as work opportunities shifted.[1][4] After high school, Big Al secured them steady lounge work in Las Vegas at the Silver Slipper casino, prompting a relocation around 1971 and exposing the band to the booming country circuit.[3][4] Line‑up changes followed—Snow left to marry in 1973, Jan Grubbish (a later member) departed in 1975—and the group gradually consolidated into the **Gossett Sisters** duo, Vicki and Ronni performing with a drum machine while increasingly focusing on songwriting rather than being a conventional touring rock band.[3] In the early 1980s they moved to Nashville, signed multiple publishing deals (including with Millhouse Publishing under Harold Shedd) and wrote and demoed dozens of songs that blended country, pop, and rock, often described as “not country enough, not rock enough” but prized for their melodic hooks and pop sensibility.[3][4] Although they never secured a major‑label breakthrough and ultimately disbanded around 1991 after years of pitching songs and playing clubs, their body of recordings—compiled much later on releases such as **“Tale of My Lost Love”**—has been rediscovered as a significant, long‑overlooked chapter in 1960s girl‑group, garage, and psychedelic rock history.[1][4][6]

Female Species’ legacy rests on their status as one of the earliest self‑contained teen girl rock bands who wrote and arranged their own material, navigated club circuits from Southern California to Las Vegas, and later adapted to Nashville’s songwriting economy while maintaining a distinct hybrid style.[2][3][4] Critics and reissue labels have since highlighted the group as an example of how women in the 1960s and 1970s rock world often faced structural barriers—“many doors were slammed,” as Ronni recalled—despite strong material and professional commitment.[3][5] Their story has been celebrated in later profiles and liner notes as that of two sisters who “nurtured a dream for half a century and never let it die,” and whose recordings now stand as cult favorites among garage‑psych, girl‑group, and country‑pop collectors.[2][6]

## Fun Facts
- Female Species nearly had future superstar Karen Carpenter as their drummer: she answered their newspaper ad for a new drummer before The Carpenters became famous, but circumstances prevented the collaboration from continuing.[2][4]
- Their mother, Loretta, not only supported the band but actually invented the name “Female Species,” while their father “Big Al” handled bookings and drove them to gigs, making the project a true family enterprise.[3][5]
- Because they were still in high school and underage, the band often played at California military bases and venues that served food so they could legally perform in spaces that otherwise operated like bars and clubs.[3][5]
- Despite forming in 1966 and recording throughout the late 1960s–1980s, Female Species did not receive a widely publicized full‑length retrospective album until the 2020s, when archival collections such as “Tale of My Lost Love” finally brought their work to broader attention.[1][2][6]

## Musical Connections

### Mentors/Influences
- [[the_beatles|The Beatles]] - Primary inspirational model; seeing The Beatles on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1964 directly inspired Vicki Gossett to start an all‑girl band modeled on them. (General inspiration from The Beatles’ 1960s output rather than specific covered songs, as Female Species mainly wrote originals.) [1964–late 1960s]
- [[cliffie_stone|Cliffie Stone]] - California country impresario and TV personality who took an interest in the Gossett sisters, booking them on his country shows and nudging them toward a more country‑oriented direction to pursue record deals. (Live country shows and showcases rather than specific released recordings; his influence shaped their move into country‑pop songwriting.) [Mid‑ to late‑1970s]
- [[harold_shedd|Harold Shedd]] - Co‑owner of Millhouse Publishing and influential Nashville producer/executive who signed Vicki and Ronni to a major songwriting deal, mentoring them within the Nashville publishing system. (Oversaw their catalog of 40+ compositions under Millhouse Publishing, positioning their material for potential RCA and country‑market opportunities.) [1980s]

### Key Collaborators
- [[ronni_gossett|Ronni Gossett]] - Younger sister of Vicki and co‑founder; bassist, harmony vocalist, co‑writer, and later one half of the Gossett Sisters duo at the core of Female Species. (Band singles and demos from the late 1960s–1970s; later songwriting and demos in Nashville including tracks anthologized on “Tale of My Lost Love.”) [1966–1991]
- [[dawna_snow|Dawna Snow]] - Classically trained school friend who played keyboards and contributed distinctive psychedelic‑garage organ parts in the original high‑school lineup. (Early Female Species recordings and live sets featuring songs such as “Tale of My Lost Love” and “You Need Me,” noted for wild keyboard solos.) [1966–1973]
- [[linda_peters|Linda Peters]] - Lead guitarist in the initial all‑girl lineup, providing the band’s early rock and garage‑pop guitar sound. (High‑school era live performances and studio demos/singles cut in Southern California.) [Late 1960s–early 1970s]
- [[michelle_molner|Michelle Molner]] - First of several drummers to pass through the band, anchoring the rhythm section in the early garage‑rock period. (Early club dates and recordings in the Whittier and greater Los Angeles area prior to the group’s move to Las Vegas.) [Late 1960s]
- [[big_al_gossett|“Big Al” Gossett]] - Vicki and Ronni’s father, who acted as booking agent, road manager, and logistical backbone, arranging gigs (including Las Vegas work) and touring support. (Secured Las Vegas Silver Slipper casino residency and numerous California military‑base shows that sustained the band financially.) [Late 1960s–1970s]
- [[millhouse_publishing_harold_shedd_and_team|Millhouse Publishing (Harold Shedd and team)]] - Nashville publishing company that signed the Gossett sisters, collaborating with them to pitch songs to major country artists and labels. (Catalog of approximately 42 compositions owned or controlled during their Millhouse deal, intended for artists on RCA and the wider country market.) [1980s–early 1990s]

### Artists Influenced
- [[later_girlgroup_and_garagerock_revival_listeners_and_musicians_general_influence|Later girl‑group and garage‑rock revival listeners and musicians (general influence)]] - Reissue campaigns and critical reassessments have cited Female Species as an important precursor and inspiration within the narrative of self‑contained female rock bands, particularly in garage‑psych and girl‑group revival circles. (Reissue compilation “Tale of My Lost Love” and related archival releases have circulated among collectors and contemporary musicians interested in 1960s all‑female bands.) [2010s–present]
