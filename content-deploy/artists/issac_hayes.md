## Biography
Isaac Hayes was born on August 20, 1942, in Covington, Tennessee, into extreme poverty as the child of sharecroppers. A self-taught musician proficient on piano, organ, and saxophone, he sang in church choirs and performed in Memphis nightclubs after dropping out of school. By 1964, he joined Stax Records as a session musician and house band member, rising to prominence as a songwriter and producer partnering with David Porter to craft hits like Sam & Dave's 'Soul Man' and 'Hold On! I’m Comin’'.[1][2][3][5]

Hayes launched his solo career with *Presenting Isaac Hayes* in 1968, but achieved stardom with *Hot Buttered Soul* in 1969, revolutionizing soul music through extended tracks, orchestral arrangements, deep baritone vocals, and concept albums that defied the three-minute single format. His 1971 *Shaft* soundtrack, featuring the iconic 'Theme from Shaft,' topped charts, earned an Academy Award for Best Original Song, and multiple GRAMMYs, influencing disco, rap, and urban contemporary genres. Nicknamed 'Black Moses,' he released platinum albums like *Black Moses* and scored films throughout the 1970s, while later voicing Chef on *South Park* in the 1990s.[1][2][3][4]

Hayes's legacy endures as a soul pioneer who expanded musical boundaries, blending funk, orchestration, and storytelling, while acting in films like *Truck Turner*. He continued recording into the 1990s and remained culturally influential until his death on August 10, 2008, in East Memphis, Tennessee.[1][2][3]
