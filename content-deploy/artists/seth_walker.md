## Biography
Seth Walker is a prolific contemporary Americana and blues artist, renowned for his soulful voice, accomplished guitar work, and genre-blending songwriting. Born in Burlington, North Carolina, Walker grew up on a rural commune as the son of classically trained musicians and music teachers, which led him to study cello from the age of five[5]. His early immersion in classical music provided a strong foundation, but it was in his college years that he discovered the guitar and fell in love with blues, swing, jazz, and soul, inspired by the vibrant musical traditions of the American South[5].

Walker’s musical journey was profoundly shaped by his Uncle Landon Walker, a musician and disc jockey, who introduced him to blues legends like T-Bone Walker, Snooks Eaglin, and B.B. King[1][2][3][4][5]. This pivotal exposure redirected his path from classical to roots music, and he soon developed a distinctive style that melds blues, gospel, pop, R&B, rock, and country influences. Over his near 30-year career, Walker has released twelve albums, broken into the Top 20 of the Americana Radio Charts, reached No. 2 on the Billboard Blues Album Chart, and earned critical acclaim from NPR, American Songwriter, No Depression, and Relix[1][3][4].

Having lived in Austin, New Orleans, Nashville, and now Asheville, North Carolina, Walker has absorbed the musical lineage of these diverse regions, further enriching his sound. He is a sought-after performer at venues and festivals worldwide, both as a headliner and opening act for artists such as The Mavericks, The Wood Brothers, Raul Malo, Paul Thorn, and Ruthie Foster[1][2][6]. In addition to his music, Walker published a memoir, 'Your Van Is On Fire,' offering a candid glimpse into the life of a touring musician. His legacy is defined by his ability to honor roots traditions while innovating within the Americana and modern blues genres.
