## Biography
Samuel Idowu Oluwadarasimi, professionally known as Soundz, was born on December 12, 2000, in Lagos, Nigeria, with origins in Ijebu, Ogun State. Developing a passion for music from an early age, he emerged as a multifaceted talent in the Nigerian music scene as a singer, songwriter, and record producer. Signed to AfroNext Entertainment, Soundz gained initial traction in 2020 with his breakout single 'Darasimi,' named after part of his full name Oluwadarasimi, which popularized his production tag 'Wicked' on platforms like Triller Nigeria.[1][2][3]

Soundz's career accelerated in 2022 with the release of his debut extended play *In The Rough* on July 27, featuring the sleeper hit 'Attention,' which debuted at number 6 and peaked at number 5 on TurnTable's Afro-Pop Songs chart after gaining momentum on TikTok. The EP itself reached number 36 on TurnTable Top 50, marking his commercial breakthrough. He followed with singles like 'Personal' and 'Cinderella,' and a feature on Laycon's 'Drunk in Love' in 2021. Describing his style as Afropop and R&B—aligning with genres like afrobeats, afrofusion, and afro soul—Soundz explained to BellaNaija that the EP reflected a personal 'rough patch,' symbolizing unappreciated potential.[1][2]

By 2023, Soundz was recognized as a Nigerian artist to watch by Pan African Music, with tracks like 'Fever' (with Fave) and millions of streams across platforms, including over 32 million for 'Attention.' His music blends romance and Afrobeat elements, positioning him as a rising star with steady career growth and significant streaming success.[1][2][3]
