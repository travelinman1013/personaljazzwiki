# Santo & Johnny

## Quick Info
- **Genres**: surf rock, exotica
- **Spotify Popularity**: 53/100
- **Followers**: 162,164
- **Origin**: Brooklyn

## Biography
Santo & Johnny were an American instrumental guitar duo made up of brothers **Santo Farina** (steel guitar, born October 24, 1937) and **Johnny Farina** (rhythm/standard guitar, born April 30, 1941), Italian‑American siblings who grew up in Brooklyn, New York.[6][3][1] Their father, stationed in Hawaii during World War II, became fascinated with the sound of the steel guitar and wrote home asking that his sons learn the instrument; after the war the family found a local steel‑guitar teacher, and Santo in particular became obsessed, practicing for hours and soon performing at amateur shows.[3][1] By his early teens Santo had formed an instrumental trio and begun writing originals alongside popular tunes and Hawaiian standards, and he eventually taught younger brother Johnny to accompany him on electric guitar, leading the pair to perform together at church dances, weddings, and clubs across Brooklyn and Long Island.[1][3]

As their local following grew, the Farina brothers recorded demo tapes and shopped them around New York; a songwriting deal with a music publisher led to a contract with Canadian‑American Records and, in 1959, the release of their debut single **“Sleep Walk,”** a haunting steel‑guitar instrumental composed by the brothers with help from their mother.[1][3][6] “Sleep Walk” became the last No. 1 instrumental of the 1950s on the U.S. pop charts and earned a gold record, vaulting Santo & Johnny onto major TV programs such as Alan Freed’s show, Dick Clark’s *American Bandstand*, and *The Perry Como Show*.[3][1] They followed with the hit “Teardrop” and a run of LPs on Canadian‑American before moving to United Artists and then Imperial, all while touring coast‑to‑coast in the U.S. and increasingly focusing on audiences in Australia, Mexico, and especially Europe, where their melodic steel‑guitar sound found enduring popularity.[1][3][4]

During the 1960s and 1970s the duo broadened their repertoire beyond early rock ’n’ roll instrumentals into lush, often cinematic arrangements of film themes, standards, and contemporary pop, including a Beatles covers LP whose rendition of “And I Love Her” spent 21 weeks at No. 1 in Mexico.[3][1] Signed to Italian labels, they scored major European successes with versions of “Maria Elena,” “Love Story,” “Love Is Blue,” and James Bond themes, and in 1973 their recording of *The Godfather* theme held the No. 1 spot in Italy for 26 weeks, earning another gold record and induction into an Italian Hall of Fame.[3] Although the duo officially disbanded in 1976, with Santo continuing to record internationally and Johnny carrying on the Santo & Johnny repertoire as a solo performer, their signature track “Sleep Walk” remained a touchstone: it received BMI’s Million‑Air Award in 1999 for over two million radio plays, while Brian Setzer’s version won the Grammy for Best Pop Instrumental Performance that same year, and in 2002 Santo & Johnny were inducted into the International Steel Guitar Hall of Fame, cementing their legacy as pioneers of the atmospheric steel‑guitar style that helped shape surf rock and exotica.[3][2][7]

## Fun Facts
- “Sleep Walk” was famously written late at night after a gig when the brothers couldn’t fall asleep and started jamming, turning their insomnia into a No. 1 hit.[2][3]
- Their father first heard the steel guitar while stationed in Hawaii during World War II and was so captivated that he wrote home asking that his young sons be taught this unusual instrument, directly shaping the duo’s future sound.[3][1]
- Santo & Johnny’s Beatles covers album produced a version of “And I Love Her” that stayed at No. 1 in Mexico for 21 weeks and earned them the Golden Kangaroo Award there.[3]
- Their 1973 rendition of *The Godfather* movie theme was such a phenomenon in Italy that it held the No. 1 spot for 26 weeks, broke national records, earned a gold record, and helped them secure their own TV show in Italy while they worked clubs and casinos across Europe.[3]
