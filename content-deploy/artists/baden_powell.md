## Biography
Baden Powell de Aquino (6 August 1937 – 26 September 2000), known professionally as **Baden Powell**, was a Brazilian guitarist and composer born in Varre-e-Sai, in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.[2][4][5] His father Lino de Aquino, a guitarist and ardent Boy Scout enthusiast, named him after Robert Baden-Powell, founder of the Scout movement, and regularly hosted choro gatherings at home with major Rio musicians such as Pixinguinha and Donga, immersing the young Baden in Brazilian popular music from infancy.[1][5][6] The family moved when he was still a baby to the São Cristóvão area of Rio de Janeiro, where he began guitar studies around age eight with the renowned choro guitarist Jayme “Meira” Florence, absorbing both classical techniques (including the works of Segovia and Tárrega) and the Brazilian guitar tradition of players like Garoto and Dilermando Reis.[1][2][5][6] A prodigy, he won radio talent contests as a child and by his mid-teens was already performing professionally on Rádio Nacional, accompanying singers, playing dances and club dates, and touring Brazil.[2][3][5][6]

Through the 1950s, Powell worked in Rio’s vibrant nightlife, including playing with pianist Ed Lincoln’s trio at the Bar Plaza in Copacabana, where exposure to visiting jazz greats and local modernists deepened his interest in swing and American jazz while he remained firmly rooted in samba and choro.[1][2][5][6] He began composing in this period, scoring an early hit with “Samba Triste” (1956), written with lyricist Billy Blanco and later widely recorded internationally.[1][3][5] In 1962 he met poet and diplomat Vinícius de Moraes, initiating a landmark partnership that yielded the **Afro‑Sambas**, a cycle that merged Rio-style samba, candomblé and umbanda rhythms, Afro-Brazilian religious themes, and sophisticated harmonic language into a powerful new idiom, epitomized on the 1966 album *Os Afro-Sambas de Baden e Vinícius*.[1][2][5] Powell also released influential solo albums such as *Um violão na madrugada* (1963) and *Tristeza on Guitar* and became house guitarist for the Elenco label and a featured player on Elis Regina’s TV program *O Fino da Bossa*, while building a strong European following after successful performances in Paris at the Olympia and elsewhere.[2][5]

Powell’s style is distinguished by a **percussive, rhythmically driving right hand**, extended harmonies drawn from jazz, and classical-level left-hand technique applied to the nylon-string guitar, allowing him to blend bossa nova, samba, choro, Afro-Brazilian ritual music, and European classical elements into a highly personal language.[2][4][5][7] Unlike the understated cool of some bossa nova contemporaries, he favored a more intense, virtuosic attack that emphasized both groove and contrapuntal independence.[2] Over a career that produced more than 500 compositions, he became one of Brazil’s most celebrated guitarists and a key figure in linking traditional Brazilian forms with modern jazz and concert-hall sensibilities, influencing generations of guitarists in Brazil and abroad and helping to establish the Brazilian guitar as a leading voice in 20th‑century music.[1][2][5][8]

## Fun Facts
- Baden Powell was named after Robert Baden-Powell, the founder of the worldwide Scout movement, reflecting his father’s enthusiasm for scouting.[1][2][3][5]
- As a teenager he had to obtain special permission from a juvenile court to work professionally at radio and television stations and in Copacabana nightclubs because he was underage.[1]
- In his family lineage, his grandfather organized what is described as the first Black orchestra in his region, and his father regularly hosted rodas of chorões at home, so Powell grew up literally surrounded by leading musicians of Rio’s golden age.[5][7]
- Unlike many bossa nova pioneers who built their careers through New York and the U.S. market, Powell developed much of his international reputation in Europe, frequently traveling between Brazil and European cities such as Paris and performing at venues like the Olympia theater.[1][2][5]
