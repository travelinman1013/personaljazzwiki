## Biography
KiDi (Dennis Nana Dwamena), Olivetheboy, and Kojo Blak are three distinct Ghanaian artists in the afrobeats, hiplife, afropop, and AfroFusion scenes, often connected through collaborations like the anticipated remix of Kojo Blak's 'Ragged' featuring Olivetheboy and songwriting ties with KiDi. Kojo Blak, born McDonald Braide on July 23, 2001, in Dansoman, Accra, Ghana, began his music journey early, influenced by icons like Michael Jackson and E.T. Mensah, blending African rhythms, pop culture, Caribbean sounds, Afrobeat, highlife, and contemporary elements to create authentic stories of struggle, growth, and love. KiDi, a established singer-songwriter, has long contributed to afrobeats and related genres, while Olivetheboy represents the rising wave in these styles, with their shared Spotify popularity of 54 highlighting collective appeal[1][2][5].

Kojo Blak's career gained momentum through self-promotion on social media platforms like TikTok, IG, and YouTube, leading to breakthroughs such as writing major parts of KiDi and Blacko's hit 'Lomo Lomo,' which transformed his life financially and boosted his recognition in Ghana. Signed to Jadon Shatta Entertainment, he has released tracks like 'Excellent' with Kelvyn Boy, the '757' EP, and the '131' EP, breaking barriers in the industry with versatile collaborations and a focus on promoting Ghanaian culture globally. Their musical styles emphasize infectious vibes with Nigerian influences, positioning them as key figures in Ghana's music evolution[1][2][3].
