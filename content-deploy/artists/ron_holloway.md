## Biography
Ron Holloway, born Ronald Edward Holloway on August 24, 1953, in Washington, D.C., grew up immersed in music through his father's collection of Blue Note and Prestige records featuring saxophonists and trumpeters. Initially interested in science, he began playing saxophone in 1966 after being persuaded by friends to join his high school band, starting on alto before switching to tenor sax within three months. By his teens, Holloway was gigging in local R&B, rock, and funk bands while also performing in his school orchestra, laying the foundation for his versatile style that spans hard bop, R&B, funk, and ballads.[1][4][6]

Holloway's career gained momentum in the 1970s with performances alongside Root Boy Slim's Sex Change Band on cult hits like 'Boogie ’Til You Puke' and 'You Broke My Mood Ring.' He forged a long-term collaboration with Gil Scott-Heron starting in 1982, recording and touring extensively. Transitioning deeper into jazz, he sat in with Sonny Rollins and Freddie Hubbard, met Dizzy Gillespie in 1977, and joined Gillespie's quintet permanently from 1989 until the trumpeter's death in 1993. His distinctive tenor saxophone sound, particularly his mastery of the upper register spanning nearly five octaves with soprano-like lyricism and trumpet-like staccato, was inspired by John Coltrane's Africa/Brass album.[1][3][4]

Known for his genre-spanning versatility, Holloway has been a member of bands like Susan Tedeschi's (for four years), The Warren Haynes Band, and frequent guest with Gov’t Mule, Tedeschi Trucks Band, and The Allman Brothers Band. A Washington, D.C. jazz and funk legend, he has earned over 40 Washington Area Music Awards. Holloway remains one of the busiest tenor saxophonists, emphasizing open-mindedness and pushing instrumental boundaries for complete musical expression.[2][3][4][7]

## Fun Facts
- Holloway uses special fingering techniques to extend his tenor saxophone range from the standard two-and-a-half octaves to nearly five, enabling soprano-like lyricism and trumpet-like staccato in the upper register.[1][3]
- He was reluctantly persuaded by friends to try band instruments in 1966, initially grabbing an alto sax before switching to tenor within three months, marking 45+ years of playing by 2011.[4]
- A D.C. legend, Holloway has won over 40 Washington Area Music Awards, including two for his own performances.[7]
- Despite early interest in science (with a telescope and microscope from his parents), music from his father's weekly Blue Note/Prestige record buys shaped his path.[1][4]
