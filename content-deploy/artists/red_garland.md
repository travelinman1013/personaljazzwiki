## Biography
Red Garland, born William McKinley Garland Jr. on March 13, 1923, in Dallas, Texas, was a pivotal figure in jazz piano, renowned for his influential block chord style. Garland began his musical journey on clarinet and alto saxophone, studying with Buster Smith—a key influence on Charlie Parker—before switching to piano during his Army service in World War II. He was largely self-taught, inspired by hearing fellow servicemen play, and quickly developed his skills after taking lessons at Fort Huachuca, Arizona[1][2][4].

After the war, Garland joined Hot Lips Page’s band and toured extensively, eventually settling in New York where he played with jazz luminaries such as Charlie Parker, Billy Eckstine, Coleman Hawkins, and Fats Navarro. His career reached its zenith as the pianist for Miles Davis’s legendary Quintet from 1955 to 1958, contributing to seminal albums like 'Workin’,' 'Steamin’,' 'Round About Midnight,' and 'Milestones.' Garland’s elegant, swinging style—marked by locked chords and melodic flow—became a defining sound of 1950s jazz and influenced generations of pianists[1][3][4].

After leaving Davis’s group, Garland led his own trio, recording acclaimed albums such as 'All Mornin’ Long,' 'Soul Junction,' and 'High Pressure.' He returned to Dallas in 1965, performing sporadically until a late-career resurgence in the late 1970s, including the album 'Red Alert.' Garland passed away in Dallas on April 23, 1984, leaving a lasting legacy as one of jazz’s most expressive and influential pianists[1][2][4].
