## Biography
Sonic Chambers Quartet is a free jazz ensemble co-led by saxophonist and clarinetist Tomas Majcherski and saxophonist and clarinetist Byron Asher. The group emerged from weekly jam sessions that began in Harlem in 2019 before establishing itself as a New Orleans-based collective. The quartet represents a contemporary approach to free jazz that blends spontaneous composition with through-composed classical structures, drawing inspiration from the boundary-breaking work of Ornette Coleman and Don Cherry while incorporating the three-horn front-line tradition of New Orleans jazz.

Majcherski, a multi-instrumentalist who grew up in East Hampton, New York, brings classical training and compositional sophistication to the ensemble. His musical mentors included Marilyn Van Scoyoc, Michael Kendrot, Hal McKusick from his East Hampton schooling, and vibraphonist Teddy Charles, who had performed with Miles Davis and Charles Mingus. The quartet's approach is distinctive in its rejection of traditional chordal instruments like piano or guitar, instead employing counterpoint and collective improvisation where all members contribute complementary melodic lines. Their 2024 debut album "Kiss of the Earth" on 577 Records showcases this philosophy, featuring through-composed arrangements including a reinterpretation of Igor Stravinsky's "The Adoration of the Earth" from The Rite of Spring, demonstrating the group's synthesis of contemporary classical music with free jazz aesthetics.

The ensemble's sound reflects the deep New Orleans roots of its members, who have lived in the city for extended periods. Completed by bassist Matt Booth and drummer Doug Garrison (also known for his work with the band the Iguanas), Sonic Chambers Quartet operates at the intersection of spontaneous and extended composition, creating music that maintains compositional rigor while allowing for spontaneous arrangement and collective performance. Their work represents a contemporary evolution of free jazz that honors both the improvisational spirit of the genre and the structural complexity of classical composition.

## Fun Facts

- Tomas Majcherski has a personal connection to Don Cherry's legacy through his mother's friendship with Moki, Don Cherry's longtime partner and artist, allowing him to discuss music and gain insights into Cherry's compositional approach.
- The group deliberately eschews traditional jazz composition structure by eliminating chordal instruments like piano or guitar, instead using counterpoint and collective improvisation similar to the three-horn front-line tradition of New Orleans jazz.
- Sonic Chambers Quartet grew organically from weekly jam sessions in Harlem beginning in 2019 before the members relocated to New Orleans, where they developed their distinctive sound rooted in the city's musical traditions.
