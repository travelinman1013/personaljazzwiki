## Biography
Lightnin' Hopkins, born Samuel John Hopkins on March 15, 1912, in Centerville, Texas, was a seminal figure in American blues whose career spanned six decades and hundreds of recordings. Raised in a family of sharecroppers and the grandson of slaves, Hopkins was immersed in the blues from an early age, building his first guitar from a cigar box and wire. His earliest musical influences came from family members, notably his older brothers Joel and John Henry, and a pivotal encounter with Blind Lemon Jefferson at a church picnic, who mentored the young Hopkins and inspired his lifelong devotion to the blues[4][3].

Hopkins began performing at local dances and picnics, eventually traveling across Texas and working with his cousin, the singer Texas Alexander. After a stint in a Houston County prison farm in the late 1930s, Hopkins returned to music, and in 1946, a talent scout discovered him in Houston, leading to his first recordings with pianist 'Thunder' Smith. The resulting 'Thunder and Lightnin'' sessions produced the hit 'Katie Mae Blues,' launching Hopkins into a prolific recording career. He became known for his deeply personal lyrics, improvisational style, and the distinctive 'Texas pinch' guitar technique, which blended country blues with electric blues as the genre evolved[1][2].

Throughout his career, Hopkins recorded over six hundred tracks, performed internationally—including at Carnegie Hall and on European tours—and appeared on television. His music addressed both social and personal themes, capturing the struggles and spirit of African American life in Texas. Hopkins's legacy is marked by his influence on blues and rock musicians, his storytelling prowess, and his enduring impact on American music. He died in Houston, Texas, on January 30, 1982, leaving behind a rich cultural footprint[1][5].
