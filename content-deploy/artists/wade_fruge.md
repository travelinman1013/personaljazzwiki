## Biography
Wade Frugé (August 27, 1916 – June 23, 1992) was a master of Cajun fiddle, born in Tasso near Eunice, Louisiana. Raised in a rural farming community, he balanced a life of agriculture—raising sheep and farming—with a deep dedication to the traditional music of his region. Frugé learned to play the fiddle from local contemporaries and elders, absorbing the nuances of the old Cajun style that was rapidly disappearing by the mid-20th century[1][2][7].

Throughout his life, Frugé remained a part-time musician, performing primarily at local gatherings and house dances rather than pursuing commercial fame. His playing was celebrated for its delicate grace notes, piercing chords, and powerful bowing, qualities that made him one of the last great exponents of the 'old timey' Cajun fiddle tradition[4][5]. Frugé's only solo album, 'Old-Style Cajun Music,' was recorded late in his life, with sessions spanning from 1979 to 1989 at the home of Marc Savoy, a noted Cajun musician and folklorist[1][6].

Frugé's legacy is that of a cultural preservationist, keeping alive the authentic Cajun fiddle style and passing it on to younger generations. His recordings and mentorship have influenced a new wave of musicians dedicated to traditional Cajun music, ensuring that the sound of southwest Louisiana endures[1][5].
