## Biography
Connie Evingson is a celebrated American jazz vocalist born in 1962 in Hibbing, Minnesota. Raised in the Midwest, she developed an early passion for music that would lead her to become one of the most versatile and adventurous voices in contemporary jazz. Evingson's career is marked by her willingness to explore a wide range of styles, from jazz and Broadway standards to tributes to iconic artists like Peggy Lee and The Beatles. Her discography, released primarily through Minnehaha Music, includes acclaimed albums such as 'Fever: A Tribute to Peggy Lee,' 'Let it Be Jazz: Connie Evingson Sings the Beatles,' and several projects in the 'hot club' gypsy jazz tradition inspired by Django Reinhardt.

Throughout her career, Evingson has performed at prestigious venues and festivals across the United States, Europe, and Japan. She has been a guest artist at Jazz at Lincoln Center alongside Wynton Marsalis, Michael Feinstein, and Vince Giordano, and has collaborated with orchestras such as the Minnesota Orchestra and the Toronto Symphony under Doc Severinsen. Her performances on Garrison Keillor’s 'A Prairie Home Companion' and features on NPR and the Smithsonian Jazz Singers radio series have further cemented her reputation. Evingson's voice is noted for its smoky texture and precise articulation, allowing her to bring emotional depth and clarity to genres ranging from bebop and bossa nova to big-band swing and ballads.

Evingson's legacy is defined by her adventurous spirit and her ability to find the heart of a song, captivating audiences and critics alike. She is a two-time recipient of both the McKnight Fellowship for Performing Musicians and the Minnesota State Arts Board Artist’s Initiative Grant. Her ongoing collaborations with leading jazz musicians and ensembles, as well as her standing invitation at the Dakota Jazz Club in Minneapolis, reflect her enduring influence and commitment to the jazz tradition.
