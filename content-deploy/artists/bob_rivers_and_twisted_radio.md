## Biography
Bob Rivers & Twisted Radio is the collective name associated with American radio host, producer, and parody songwriter **Bob Rivers** and the comedy-music team that developed around his long‑running Seattle morning show, **“Bob Rivers Twisted Radio.”** Born July 7, 1956, in Branford, Connecticut, Rivers became obsessed with radio as a child, building bootleg basement broadcasts in his teens and entering professional radio in New England in the 1970s.[1][5] After early programming and on‑air roles in New Hampshire and Massachusetts, he began crafting topical parody and novelty songs at Worcester rock station WAAF, where his “Twisted Tunes” segments on *The Bob & Zip Show* gained traction regionally and through the American Comedy Network syndication service.[1][5] His Christmas parodies—especially the 1987 album *Twisted Christmas*, featuring “The Twelve Pains of Christmas”—brought him national attention and a gold certification from the RIAA, establishing the Twisted brand that would later be attached to his Seattle show and band of regular collaborators.[1][3][4]

In 1987 Rivers moved to WIYY “98 Rock” in Baltimore, where he mixed high‑energy morning‑show antics with an ambitious schedule of parody production, famously staying on the air for 11 days during a Baltimore Orioles losing streak—a stunt that won Billboard’s Radio Promotion of the Year and cemented his reputation for immersive radio theater.[1][3][4][5] In 1989 he relocated to Seattle’s KISW, launching **Bob Rivers Twisted Radio**, a fast‑paced ensemble morning show blending rock, sketch comedy, listener calls, and professionally recorded parody songs, and later continued similar formats at KZOK and KJR for a 25‑year Seattle run.[1][4][5] Musically, Bob Rivers & Twisted Radio specialized in **style‑perfect parody**, re‑creating rock, pop, and Christmas genres with meticulous studio arrangements while twisting the lyrics into sharp topical or seasonal satire; notable songs include “The Twelve Pains of Christmas,” “I Am Santa Claus,” and “What If God Smoked Cannabis.”[1][3][4] After retiring from daily radio in 2014, Rivers continued performing keyboards with Spike & The Impalers and Heart by Heart, pursued hobbies like beekeeping and maple‑syrup making in New England, and recorded a final Twisted Tune after a 2022 cancer diagnosis before his death on March 11, 2025, leaving a legacy as one of U.S. radio’s most prolific and polished musical parodists.[1][3][4]

Within the broader comedy‑music landscape, Bob Rivers & Twisted Radio bridged classic radio novelty traditions and modern rock‑oriented parody, using a full band, strong vocalists, and studio‑grade production to create songs that stood alone outside their broadcast context.[3][4][5] His work influenced the sound of late‑20th‑century American rock morning shows by demonstrating that local radio comedy could be produced with album‑quality musicianship and then syndicated nationally, and his Twisted Christmas catalog in particular became a seasonal staple on rock and classic‑hits stations across North America.[1][3][4][6] Though built around Rivers’ on‑air persona, Twisted Radio functioned as a collaborative troupe of writers, musicians, and comedians whose recurring characters, sketches, and musical parodies helped define Seattle’s radio identity for over two decades.

## Fun Facts
- In 1988, Rivers stayed on the air at Baltimore’s WIYY for 11 straight days—sleeping only during songs—until the Baltimore Orioles finally ended a 21‑game losing streak, a promotion that won Billboard’s Radio Promotion of the Year and made him a folk hero to Orioles fans.[1][3][4][5]
- His parody “Breaking Up Is Hard on You,” about the breakup of AT&T’s Bell System, was one of his first major Twisted Tunes and became widely known through radio syndication, helping launch his national reputation before Twisted Christmas.[1][5]
- Rivers’ signature holiday album Twisted Christmas, driven by the hit “The Twelve Pains of Christmas,” was certified gold by the RIAA and turned his offbeat Christmas songs into annual staples on rock stations.[1][3][4]
- After retiring from radio, Rivers pursued beekeeping, maple‑syrup production, and even conquered a fear of flying by becoming a pilot in New England, all while occasionally returning to the studio to record one last Twisted Tune following his cancer diagnosis.[3]
