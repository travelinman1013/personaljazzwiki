## Biography
J & The Causeways is a New Orleans-based soul/R&B band founded in a serendipitous sequence of events at the legendary Maple Leaf Bar on a hot summer night, led by singer-songwriter-keyboardist Jordan Anderson. Anderson, a Louisiana native raised in a small rural hometown, was first exposed to music through his grandmother, a piano teacher whose backroom record collection introduced him to icons like Otis Redding, Al Green, Aretha Franklin, and Queen. This early immersion shaped his powerful, emotionally charged vocal style, emphasizing vulnerability and raw expression over conventional pitch.[1][5][6]

The band, a juggernaut ensemble featuring heavy backbeats, soaring horn sections, and Anderson's magnetic vocals, has been active for nearly eight years, evolving from early struggles to secure their sound in New Orleans' competitive scene. Their debut album, Motions, recorded at Studio in the Country and Esplanade Studios, embodies themes of togetherness, compassion, healing, and cymatics—the visual patterns of sound vibrations—reflecting Anderson's fascination with energetic connections and inner power. Often compared to acts like St. Paul & The Broken Bones, Nathaniel Rateliff & The Night Sweats, The Marcus King Band, Alabama Shakes, and Brittany Howard, they excel in live performances, fostering inclusivity and joy in audiences.[1][6][7]

Rooted in New Orleans' vibrant music culture, J & The Causeways represent a modern soul revival, with Anderson noting the city's demand for an A-game performance amid its storied history. Their music aims to unlock vulnerability and elevate listeners, drawing from soul's communal spirit to create genuine, transcendent moments onstage.[1][2]
