## Biography
Peter Case is an acclaimed American singer-songwriter and guitarist whose career has spanned over five decades, marked by a restless creative spirit and a deep connection to the roots of Americana, folk rock, and alt-country. Born in Buffalo, New York, Case was drawn to music from a young age, receiving his first guitar at ten. His early life was turbulent—he left home at fifteen, dropped out of high school, and spent time as a street musician in San Francisco, experiences that deeply informed his songwriting and worldview[1][3][4].

Case first gained recognition in the mid-1970s as a founding member of the influential power pop/punk trio The Nerves, alongside Jack Lee and Paul Collins. The Nerves toured nationally and opened for acts like The Ramones, but disbanded in 1978. Case then formed The Plimsouls in Los Angeles, achieving cult status with the hit "A Million Miles Away," which was featured in the film 'Valley Girl.' After The Plimsouls disbanded in 1984, Case embarked on a solo career, releasing a critically acclaimed self-titled debut in 1986, followed by a series of albums that cemented his reputation as a master storyteller and chronicler of American life[1][2][3].

Case's music is characterized by its blend of rock, folk, and blues influences, and his lyrics often explore themes of longing, dislocation, and the search for meaning. He has been praised for his ability to connect with audiences through emotionally resonant songs and has influenced a generation of roots-oriented musicians. His legacy endures through a prolific solo discography, continued touring, and a reputation as a songwriter's songwriter[1][2][6].
