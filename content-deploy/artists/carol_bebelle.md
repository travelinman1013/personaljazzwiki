## Biography
Carol Bebelle, also known by her African name Akua Wambui, is a native New Orleanian and cultural advocate who has dedicated over four decades to championing arts, culture, and community development in her city. She earned her undergraduate degree in sociology from Loyola University New Orleans, where she enrolled at age 16 during the university's second year of integration, and later obtained a master's degree in education administration from Tulane University. Throughout her career, Bebelle spent nearly 20 years as an administrator and planner of education, social, cultural, and health programs in the public sector before transitioning to independent consulting work in 1990 through her firm Master Plan Development Associates.

Recognizing the untapped potential of New Orleans' cultural and creative resources by 1995, Bebelle shifted her focus toward leveraging culture and creativity as tools for community development and economic inclusion. In 1998, she co-founded the Ashé Cultural Arts Center in the Central City neighborhood, establishing a space where art intersects with civic engagement and reflects the surrounding Black community. Beyond her organizational work, Bebelle is an accomplished writer and poet, having published a collection titled "In a Manner of Speaking" and contributed essays and work to several anthologies including "From a Bend in the River," "Civic Engagement in the Wake of Katrina," and "Didn't Wash Us Away: Transformative Stories of Post-Katrina Cultural Resilience." Her decades of transformational work have earned her numerous local and national awards and commendations, establishing her as a constant voice and frequently sought presenter on the role of culture in creating quality urban life.

## Fun Facts
- Bebelle enrolled in college at age 16 and initially attempted to attend Wake Forest University with two friends, but her mother and the other mothers intervened, leading her to attend Loyola University New Orleans instead.
- She began her community organizing career somewhat by happenstance, being assigned the task of designing parent advisory committees for the New Orleans school board during the implementation of Title I ESEA funding—work that launched her entire career in community-based planning.
- While maintaining her public sector career, Bebelle simultaneously built a parallel professional life working with churches, community-based organizations, Black theatre companies, and Black nationalist organizations focused on education and youth enrichment.
- The Ashé Cultural Arts Center was established on Oretha Castle Haley Boulevard in Central City, a location the community had envisioned for cultural development for years, with approximately 30 previous plans developed before Bebelle and her co-founder's vision was realized.
