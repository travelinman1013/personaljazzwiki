She began her musical journey singing gospel with her mother in their church choir, a foundation that deeply influenced her vocal style and spiritual approach to music[2][5][6].

In the 1990s, after relocating to Germany, she became a prominent figure in European jazz and gospel scenes, organizing the first Gospel Workshop in Lüneburg and producing the North German Gospel and Spiritual Festival[1]. Harrington is celebrated for her warm, expressive vocals and her ability to seamlessly blend genres, maintaining authenticity and emotional depth in her performances[4][7].
