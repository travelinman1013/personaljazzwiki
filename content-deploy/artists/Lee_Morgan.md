## Biography
Lee Morgan was born on July 10, 1938, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and emerged as a prodigious jazz talent from a young age. Receiving his first trumpet as a gift from his sister at age 13, Morgan quickly developed his skills, taking private lessons and performing professionally by age 15. His early influences included the legendary Clifford Brown, who gave him lessons and inspired his stylistic approach. By 18, Morgan was a featured soloist in Dizzy Gillespie's big band, gaining valuable experience and exposure on the international jazz scene.

Morgan's career flourished in the late 1950s and 1960s, particularly through his association with Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers, where he contributed to landmark recordings such as 'Moanin’.' As a leader, Morgan recorded prolifically for Blue Note Records, blending hard bop with blues, R&B, and later, modal and avant-garde elements. His 1964 composition 'The Sidewinder' became a crossover hit, reaching the pop and R&B charts and cementing his reputation as a leading figure in hard bop. Despite periods of personal struggle, including heroin addiction, Morgan remained an innovative force, known for his emotionally charged playing and technical mastery.

Tragically, Morgan's life was cut short when he was shot and killed by his common-law wife during a performance at Slug's Saloon in New York City on February 19, 1972. His legacy endures through his influential recordings, his role in advancing the hard bop idiom, and his impact on generations of jazz musicians who followed.
