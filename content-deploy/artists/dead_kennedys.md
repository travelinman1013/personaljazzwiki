## Biography
Dead Kennedys are an American hardcore punk band that formed in San Francisco, California, in June 1978, when guitarist East Bay Ray (Raymond Pepperell) placed an advertisement in a local music publication seeking bandmates. The original lineup included East Bay Ray on lead guitar, Klaus Flouride (Geoffrey Lyall) on bass, Jello Biafra (Eric Reed Boucher) on vocals, Ted (Bruce Slesinger) on drums, and 6025 (Carlos Cadona) on rhythm guitar. The band quickly established itself as one of the defining forces of the American punk scene, releasing their first single "California Über Alles" in June 1979 on their own independent label, Alternative Tentacles Records. This was followed by landmark releases including "Holiday in Cambodia" (1980) and their debut album Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables (1980), which achieved Gold Record status in Britain. The band's early lineup underwent changes, with 6025 departing in March 1979 and Ted being replaced by D.H. Peligro at the end of 1980, with Peligro becoming the band's longest-serving drummer until his death in 2022.

Throughout the 1980s, Dead Kennedys became pioneers of hardcore punk, known for their biting satirical commentary on American foreign policy, social issues, and political figures. The band released several influential albums including In God We Trust Inc. (1981), Plastic Surgery Disasters (1982), Frankenchrist (1985), and Bedtime for Democracy (1986). Despite their material being banned from British airwaves, they achieved significant chart success in the United Kingdom and toured extensively across North America, Europe, and Australia. The band announced their breakup in January 1986 after eight years of activity. Dead Kennedys reformed in 2001 with East Bay Ray, D.H. Peligro, and Klaus Flouride, bringing in Brandon Cruz as the new vocalist to replace the departed Jello Biafra. The reformed band continued performing until Peligro's death in 2022, establishing Dead Kennedys as one of the most important and enduring bands in punk rock history.

Musically, Dead Kennedys are characterized by their furious, aggressive instrumentation combined with Jello Biafra's distinctive quavering, caustic vocal delivery that cut through the band's riffing with precision. The band was instrumental in establishing the do-it-yourself ethos in punk rock, with Biafra and East Bay Ray founding Alternative Tentacles Records not only to release their own material but also to support other artists. Their satirical approach to punk—blending humor with serious sociopolitical critique—set them apart from their contemporaries and influenced generations of punk and hardcore bands that followed.

## Fun Facts
- In 1979, the same year Dead Kennedys released their first single "California Über Alles," lead vocalist Jello Biafra actually ran for mayor of San Francisco on a platform that included banning cars and hiring the unemployed to panhandle in wealthy neighborhoods.
- The song "Too Drunk to Fuck" remarkably became a British Top 40 single in 1981, despite the band's material being banned from British airwaves, demonstrating the paradoxical popularity of their provocative content.
- Dead Kennedys were pioneers of the do-it-yourself recording ethos, with Jello Biafra and East Bay Ray founding Alternative Tentacles Records not only to release their own albums but also to support and distribute material by other artists, establishing an independent label model.
- The band's 1981 EP "In God We Trust, Inc." included the anti-violence anthem "Nazi Punks, Fuck Off," which became an iconic statement against violence within the punk community despite the band's aggressive musical style.
