## Biography
SBTRKT (Aaron Jerome) and Sampha (Sampha Lahai Sisay) are two influential British musicians whose collaborative work helped define the sound of UK electronic and alternative R&B in the early 2010s. SBTRKT, born in London, began his career as a producer and remixer, quickly gaining recognition for his innovative blend of garage, dubstep, and pop. Sampha, born in Morden, South London to Sierra Leonean parents, started making music as a teenager, learning piano at home and later discovering music production through his older brother. Both artists met through the Young Turks label, where Sampha interned and SBTRKT was already an emerging producer. Their partnership flourished on SBTRKT’s self-titled debut album in 2011, with Sampha contributing vocals, songwriting, and production to eight of the thirteen tracks. The album’s critical success established both artists as central figures in the UK’s electronic music scene.

Musically, SBTRKT is known for his masked persona and genre-blending production, while Sampha’s emotive, soulful voice and introspective songwriting have become his signature. Their collaborative style fused electronic beats with heartfelt lyrics, influencing a generation of artists across genres. Sampha’s solo career took off with the release of his Mercury Prize-winning album Process in 2017, while SBTRKT continued to release acclaimed solo work and collaborate with artists like Jessie Ware and Little Dragon. Together, their legacy is marked by a unique synergy that bridged underground and mainstream audiences, pushing the boundaries of electronic and R&B music.
