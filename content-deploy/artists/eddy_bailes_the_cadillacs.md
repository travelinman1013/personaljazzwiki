## Biography
Eddy Bailes was born in Parkersburg, West Virginia, and became a notable recording artist during the 1960s and 1970s, particularly known for his work in doo-wop and country-inflected pop. Bailes began his musical journey in his hometown, eventually forming Eddy Bailes & The Cadillacs, a group that blended vocal harmony with teen rock and roll sensibilities. His early releases, such as 'Dark Side Of The Moon' and 'If This Is Sin,' showcased his affinity for vocal-driven arrangements and catchy melodies, earning him regional acclaim[1].

Bailes's career reached a high point in 1975 when he wrote and recorded 'The West Virginian,' a song that resonated deeply with his home state and achieved gold record status. The song's popularity was such that a bill was introduced in the West Virginia legislature to make it the official state song. Throughout his career, Bailes recorded for several labels, including BJ Records and Cozy, and collaborated with The Accents as backing vocalists. He also appeared in movies and television, and opened for major country and pop stars like Rick Nelson, Marty Robbins, George Jones, and Mickey Gilley[1].

Beyond his own recordings, Bailes contributed to the careers of other artists, notably writing Faron Young's last single, 'Just An Old Heartache.' He was respected as a mentor and teacher in the country music scene, remembered for his generosity and musicianship. Bailes spent his later years in Hendersonville, Tennessee, where he passed away on June 17, 2002[1].
