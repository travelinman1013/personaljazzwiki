## Biography
Hannah Read is a Scottish-born, award-winning multi-instrumentalist, singer-songwriter, and composer, acclaimed for her evocative fiddle playing and expressive vocals. Raised in Edinburgh and on the Isle of Eigg, she was immersed in Scotland’s vibrant traditional music scene from a young age, influenced by a musical family and a close-knit community of folk musicians. Read began playing traditional Scottish music at age six, later honing her craft at The City of Edinburgh Music School, the American School of Modern Music in Paris, and the prestigious Berklee College of Music in Boston[2][5].

Her career bridges the Atlantic, with Read now based in Brooklyn, New York, and Northern California. She has released several solo albums, including the critically acclaimed 'Way Out I’ll Wander' (2018), praised for its seamless blend of British folk and American influences and described as 'deserving crossover status' by The Guardian[1][2]. Read is also known for her collaborative work, notably as a member of the British folk super-group Songs of Separation, which won 'Album of the Year' at the 2017 BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards[1][2]. Her music is characterized by intricate fiddle melodies, heartfelt songwriting, and a style that draws comparisons to Sandy Denny, Joni Mitchell, and Feist[1][2].

Read’s legacy is marked by her versatility—equally at home improvising on fiddle, performing Appalachian old-time music, or delivering finely wrought original songs. She continues to tour internationally, lead her own ensembles, and collaborate with a diverse array of musicians, making her a respected figure in contemporary folk and roots music[4][6].
