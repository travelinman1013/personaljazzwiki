## Biography
Roddie Romero & the Hub City All Stars are a celebrated Louisiana band known for their electrifying blend of Cajun, zydeco, blues, swamp pop, and roots rock. Founded by Roddie Romero, who was born and raised in Lafayette’s rural Southside, the group embodies the spirit of Acadiana—Louisiana’s Cajun and Creole heartland. Romero’s musical journey began early, inspired by family gatherings where his grandfather played accordion, and he quickly became a prodigy, teaching himself the instrument and performing professionally while still in high school. His mother even helped pass the 'Roddie Romero Bill,' allowing minors to perform in adult venues if accompanied by a guardian.

The Hub City All Stars formed over two decades ago, with Romero joined by longtime collaborator and pianist Eric Adcock. The band’s lineup has also included guitarist Chad Viator, bassist Chris French, and drummers Jermaine Prejean and Gary Usie. Their sound is anchored by Romero’s soulful vocals, masterful accordion, and slide guitar, with Adcock’s boogie-woogie and R&B piano stylings adding depth. Their original compositions and dynamic live shows have earned them three Grammy nominations, including for 'The La Louisianne Sessions' and 'Gulfstream.' The group is renowned for their improvisational performances—often playing without setlists—and for honoring Louisiana’s musical heritage while pushing its boundaries.

Romero and the Hub City All Stars have performed at major festivals and venues worldwide, earning acclaim for both their authentic interpretations of traditional music and their innovative songwriting. Their legacy is that of true ambassadors for Louisiana’s roots music, bridging generations and genres, and inspiring a new wave of musicians to embrace and evolve the region’s rich cultural traditions.
