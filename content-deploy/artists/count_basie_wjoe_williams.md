## Biography
Count Basie and Joe Williams represent two pivotal figures in jazz history. Count Basie, born William James Basie on August 21, 1904, in Red Bank, New Jersey, was a renowned bandleader and pianist known for his distinctive 'less is more' style, which emphasized simplicity and precision in his music. His orchestra became one of the most celebrated big bands in jazz, featuring a minimalist approach that allowed soloists to shine. Joe Williams, born Joseph Goreed on December 12, 1918, in Cordele, Georgia, was raised in Chicago and began his professional singing career at 16. He gained fame as the vocalist for Count Basie's Orchestra from 1954 to 1961, bringing a smooth baritone voice to classics like 'Every Day I Have the Blues' and 'Alright, Okay, You Win.' Their collaboration marked a significant period in Basie's career, contributing to the band's resurgence in popularity during the 1950s. Following his time with Basie, Williams pursued a successful solo career, collaborating with numerous jazz legends and winning a Grammy Award in 1984. Basie's legacy as a bandleader and Williams' as a vocalist have profoundly influenced jazz, with their work together remaining iconic in the genre.
