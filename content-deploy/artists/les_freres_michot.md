## Biography
Les Frères Michot is a renowned all-brothers Cajun band originating from the rural community of Pilette in Lafayette Parish, Louisiana. The Michot brothers—Rick, Tommy, Bobby, David, and Mike—grew up immersed in French-speaking Cajun culture, with deep family roots in the region and a heritage tracing back to early Acadian settlers. Their father, Louis J. Michot, Jr., was a prominent educator and politician, and both parents came from families where French was the first language. The brothers began playing music together informally in the mid-1960s and officially formed Les Frères Michot in 1986, aiming to preserve and celebrate the traditional Cajun 'bal de maison' (house dance) style.

Throughout their career, Les Frères Michot have been dedicated to performing authentic, all-acoustic Cajun music, eschewing drums and electric instruments in favor of fiddle, accordion, acoustic guitar, p’tit fer (triangle), and upright bass. Their repertoire features both traditional songs and original compositions, all sung in French, and their harmonies and arrangements have become a hallmark of their sound. The group has released several albums, including 'Elevés à Pilette' (1987), 'La Roue Qui Pend' (2003), and 'La Caroline' (2008), and has performed extensively across the United States, Canada, Europe, and Latin America. Their music has been featured in documentaries, films, and on national media, contributing significantly to the preservation and global appreciation of Cajun culture.

The legacy of Les Frères Michot extends beyond their own performances: their children, notably André and Louis Michot, have become influential musicians in their own right, carrying forward the family tradition with groups like the Lost Bayou Ramblers. The Michot family’s commitment to Cajun music has made them cultural ambassadors, introducing audiences worldwide to the richness of Louisiana’s musical heritage.
