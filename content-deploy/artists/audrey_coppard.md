## Biography
Audrey Coppard was a traditional folk singer active in England during the mid-20th century, best known for her influential 1956 album 'English Folk Songs' released on Folkways Records. This collection featured 14 traditional English songs, ballads, carols, riddle songs, and London street cries, capturing the essence of England's rich folk heritage. Coppard's clear, unadorned vocal style and authentic interpretations made her a respected figure among folk enthusiasts, particularly for her rendition of 'Scarborough Fair,' which is recognized as the first recorded version using the now-famous melody.

Though details of her early life remain scarce in public records, Coppard's work emerged during a period of renewed interest in English folk music, paralleling the efforts of collectors and performers like Ewan MacColl and Peggy Seeger. Her recordings contributed to the preservation and dissemination of traditional English repertoire, influencing later generations of folk musicians. Coppard's legacy endures through her Smithsonian Folkways album, which remains a reference point for students and fans of traditional English song.
