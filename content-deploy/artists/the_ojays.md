## Biography
The O'Jays are an iconic American R&B vocal group that originated in Canton, Ohio in the late 1950s. The group was formed by childhood friends Eddie Levert (born June 16, 1942, in Bessemer, Alabama, who moved to Canton at age 8) and Walter Williams (born August 25, 1942, in Canton, Ohio), who began performing gospel music together. In 1958-1959, they teamed with schoolmates William Powell (born January 20, 1942), Bobby Massey (born 1942), and Bill Isles (born January 4, 1941) to form a rhythm and blues group, initially calling themselves the Triumphs before changing to the Mascots in 1960. After releasing their single "Miracles" in 1961, Cleveland disc jockey Eddie O'Jay championed the group, leading them to rename themselves the O'Jays in 1963 as a tribute to him.

The group's breakthrough came in 1968 when they began collaborating with legendary writer-producers Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff, who infused the O'Jays' music with the hallmarks of Philadelphia soul: lush orchestration, funk rhythm, and socially conscious lyrics. After lineup changes reduced them to a trio (with Isles departing in 1965 and Massey leaving in 1971), the O'Jays signed with Philadelphia International Records and released their classic 1972 album "Back Stabbers," which became their breakthrough, reaching #3 on the Pop chart and #1 on the R&B chart. Between 1972 and 1978, they dominated the charts with eight #1 R&B singles including "Love Train" (1973), which also topped the pop charts, "For the Love of Money" (1973), "I Love Music" (1975), and "Use Ta Be My Girl" (1978). The group achieved remarkable commercial success with ten Gold albums and nine Platinum albums throughout their career.

Tragedy struck in 1975 when William Powell was diagnosed with terminal cancer and was forced to leave the band, passing away in Canton in 1977. He was replaced by Sammy Strain, a twelve-year veteran of Little Anthony and the Imperials, who performed with the group from 1977 to 1993. The O'Jays continued placing hits on the R&B charts through the 1980s and 1990s, including "Lovin' You" (1987), "Serious" (1989), and "Emotionally Yours" (1991). Their enduring legacy was recognized with induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2005 and the official R&B Music Hall of Fame in 2013. The group continued recording and touring into the 21st century, earning a Grammy nomination in 2002 for their album "For The Love Of" and maintaining their status as pioneers of the Philadelphia soul movement.

## Fun Facts
- The group changed their name twice before becoming the O'Jays - they were originally called the Triumphs in 1958-1959, then the Mascots in 1960, before finally adopting the O'Jays name in 1963 as a tribute to Cleveland disc jockey Eddie O'Jay who championed their music.
- All five original members of the group attended McKinley High School together in Canton, Ohio, making them true childhood friends who grew up singing together.
- Before achieving stardom, the O'Jays were highly sought-after session singers, backing legendary artists including Nat 'King' Cole and The Ronettes during the 1960s.
- Former member Sammy Strain filed a $15 million lawsuit in March 2007 against Eddie Levert, Walter Williams, Kenny Gamble, Leon Huff, and Philadelphia International Records, alleging he never received royalties during his sixteen years with the group despite recording eleven albums including multiple Platinum and Gold releases.
