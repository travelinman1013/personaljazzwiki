## Biography
Albert Castiglia, born August 12, 1969, in New York City to a Cuban mother and Italian father, moved to Miami, Florida, at age five. He began learning guitar at twelve, quickly developing a passion for the instrument, and made his professional debut in 1990 with the Miami Blues Authority, earning recognition as Miami's best blues guitarist by the Miami New Times in 1997. After college, he worked as a social services investigator for the state of Florida while gigging, until Chicago blues legend Junior Wells discovered him singing in 1996 and invited him to join his band as lead guitarist, touring until Wells' death in 1998.[1][2][3]

Relocating to Chicago, Castiglia worked with Sandra Hall and continued touring independently into the early 2000s, joining the Alligator Alley Allstars in 2002. He launched his solo career with the self-released album Burn in 2004, followed by releases like The Bittersweet Sessions (2006), A Stone's Throw (2006), and These Are the Days (2008), blending blues rock with original songwriting. Signing with Ruf Records in 2014, albums such as Solid Ground, Big Dog (2016), and later Gulf Coast Records efforts like Masterpiece (2019)—which won a Blues Music Award for Blues Rock Album of the Year—and I Got Love (2022), securing Blues Rock Artist and Album awards in 2023, marked his rise. His style fuses traditional electric blues with rock energy, earning nominations and tours supporting acts like ZZ Top and Elvin Bishop.[1][3][2]

Castiglia's career highlights his evolution from sideman to acclaimed artist, with consistent touring, collaborations, and awards cementing his legacy in modern blues. Recent projects include the Blood Brothers with Mike Zito and his 2025 album Righteous Soul featuring guests like Christone 'Kingfish' Ingram and Joe Bonamassa.[1][2]
