## Biography
Jon Batiste, born November 11, 1986, in Metairie, Louisiana, is a celebrated American musician, composer, bandleader, and actor whose work bridges jazz, R&B, soul, and contemporary pop. Raised in a musical New Orleans family, Batiste began playing drums at age eight before switching to piano at twelve, quickly developing a prodigious talent. He attended the Juilliard School in New York, where he refined his craft and began to gain recognition for his dynamic performances and innovative approach to jazz and improvisation.

Batiste's career accelerated with the formation of his band Stay Human, known for their energetic street performances and later as the house band for 'The Late Show with Stephen Colbert' from 2015 to 2022. His discography includes acclaimed albums such as 'Social Music,' 'Hollywood Africans,' and 'We Are,' the latter winning Album of the Year at the 2022 Grammy Awards. Batiste's genre-blending style is rooted in New Orleans jazz but incorporates funk, soul, and pop, making his sound both deeply traditional and strikingly modern. His work on the score for Pixar's 'Soul' (2020), co-composed with Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, earned him an Academy Award, Golden Globe, and BAFTA, cementing his legacy as a boundary-pushing artist who uses music as a tool for storytelling and social change.

Beyond performance, Batiste is noted for his activism and educational outreach, serving as Creative Director of the National Jazz Museum in Harlem and music director for The Atlantic. He has been a vocal advocate for civil rights, participating in and organizing peaceful protests, and supporting initiatives like the Equal Justice Initiative and the Innocence Project. His influence extends across genres and generations, making him a pivotal figure in contemporary American music.
