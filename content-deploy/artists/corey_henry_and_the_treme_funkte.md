## Biography
Corey Henry, born in July 1975, was raised in the historic Treme neighborhood of New Orleans, a cradle of jazz and brass band tradition. Immersed in music from a young age, he began on snare drum before switching to trombone at age 10, learning directly from family and local legends rather than through formal school programs. His grandfather played at Preservation Hall, and his uncle, Benny Jones Sr., a founder of the Treme Brass Band, became a key mentor. At 16, Henry was brought into the Treme Brass Band, where he learned the craft on stage, absorbing the traditions and energy of New Orleans music alongside musicians like Kermit Ruffins.

Henry's career blossomed as he became a sought-after trombonist, performing with the Treme Brass Band, Rebirth Brass Band (with whom he won a Grammy for the album 'Rebirth of New Orleans'), and Galactic. In 2011, he founded Corey Henry & The Treme Funktet to keep the neighborhood's musical spirit alive, blending retro soul, jazz fusion, groove, and funk. The group has become a staple of New Orleans' live music scene, earning accolades such as the Best of the Big Easy Award and the Spirit of Satchmo Music Award for their commitment to the city's musical legacy. Their debut album, 'Lapeitah,' and the Grammy-nominated 'Live at Vaughan's' showcase Henry's dynamic leadership and signature trombone style.

Henry's musical style is deeply rooted in the second line and brass band traditions of New Orleans, but he infuses it with contemporary funk, jazz, and soul influences. His legacy is one of both preservation and innovation, ensuring that the sounds of Treme continue to evolve and inspire new generations.
