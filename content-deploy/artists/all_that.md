## Biography
All That Remains is an American metalcore band formed in Springfield, Massachusetts, in 1998 by vocalist Philip Labonte after his departure from Shadows Fall. Initially conceived as a side project, the band quickly evolved into a full-fledged group, releasing their debut album 'Behind Silence and Solitude' in 2002, which showcased a melodic death metal influence distinct from their later sound. Over the years, All That Remains developed a signature style blending aggressive metalcore riffs, melodic hooks, and introspective lyrics, gaining recognition as one of the premier acts in the American metalcore scene.

The band's lineup has seen several changes, with Labonte remaining the only original member. Notable members have included guitarist Oli Herbert, whose technical proficiency and songwriting were instrumental until his untimely death in 2018, and rhythm guitarist Mike Martin, who joined in 2004. All That Remains achieved commercial and critical success with albums like 'This Darkened Heart' (2004), 'The Fall of Ideals' (2006), and 'Victim of the New Disease' (2018), the latter marking a return to their heavier roots. Their music often explores themes of personal struggle, resilience, and existential reflection, and they are credited with helping define the melodic metalcore genre in the 2000s and 2010s.

Touring extensively, All That Remains has shared stages with prominent metal and hardcore acts, building a loyal fanbase and influencing a new generation of metalcore musicians. Despite lineup changes and personal tragedies, the band continues to record and perform, maintaining a significant presence in the metal community.
