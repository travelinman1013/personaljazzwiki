## Biography
Wilson Pickett (March 18, 1941 – January 19, 2006) was a pivotal American soul singer and songwriter, born in Prattville, Alabama, and raised in Louisville, Kentucky. His earliest musical experiences were rooted in the Southern black church, where gospel music shaped his passionate, fervent vocal style. In the 1950s, Pickett moved to Detroit, joining the gospel group the Violinaires before transitioning to secular music with the Falcons, where he first found success with the hit 'I Found a Love.'

Pickett's solo career took off after signing with Atlantic Records in 1964, where producer Jerry Wexler sent him to Stax Records in Memphis to collaborate with guitarist Steve Cropper. This partnership yielded 'In the Midnight Hour,' a defining soul classic. Throughout the 1960s and early 1970s, Pickett's energetic, raw delivery powered a string of hits, including 'Mustang Sally,' 'Land of 1000 Dances,' and 'Funky Broadway.' His recordings at Stax and Fame Studios, often with top session musicians, helped establish the sound of Southern soul. Later, collaborations with Philadelphia producers Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff brought a smoother edge to his music. Despite personal and legal troubles in later years, Pickett's influence endured, and he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1991.

Pickett's legacy is marked by his electrifying stage presence, his role in shaping the sound of 1960s soul, and his impact on generations of artists. His music bridged gospel, R&B, and soul, and his songs remain staples of American popular culture.
