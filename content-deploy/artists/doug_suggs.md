## Biography
Doug Suggs (born December 3, 1894) was an American blues pianist from St. Louis who became known for his contributions to classic blues music.[3] Early in his career, Suggs established himself in the St. Louis blues scene before relocating to Chicago for a portion of his professional life, following the migration pattern of many blues musicians seeking greater opportunities during the early-to-mid 20th century.[2] Despite his active career as a performing musician, Suggs did not record commercially until late in his life, making his only recordings in 1956 when he recorded two piano solos that would become his sole documented studio work.[3]

Suggs's 1956 recordings have been praised by blues historians and critics as exemplary work within the blues piano tradition. Kenneth Bays of the Blues Review described one of his recordings as "one of the most exhilarating discs of 50s blues piano you'll ever hear," highlighting the technical skill and emotional depth he brought to his instrument.[4] Though Suggs remained relatively obscure in broader blues history, his piano work represents an important documentation of the classic blues tradition during the 1950s, capturing the style and virtuosity of a musician who had spent decades honing his craft in the regional blues scenes of the American South and Midwest.
