## Biography
The Gerald Wilson Orchestra was founded by Gerald Wilson, a pioneering jazz trumpeter, arranger, and bandleader born in Shelby, Mississippi in 1918[6]. Wilson began his professional career in 1937 and quickly rose to prominence when, at age 21, he joined the Jimmie Lunceford Orchestra in New York City as a trumpeter and arranger[1][2][5]. His early compositions, such as 'Hi Spook' and 'Yard Dog Mazurka,' made an immediate impact on the Lunceford repertoire and showcased his innovative approach to big band jazz[1][5].

After serving in the U.S. Navy during World War II, Wilson settled in Los Angeles and played with and wrote for leading bands led by Benny Carter and Les Hite[3][5][6]. In 1944, he formed the first Gerald Wilson Jazz Orchestra, which featured notable musicians such as trombonist Melba Liston and trumpeter Snooky Young[1][5]. The band toured nationally, earning rave reviews at venues like the Apollo Theater in New York and the Regal Theater in Chicago, where Wilson hired a young Joe Williams as vocalist[1][5]. Wilson's orchestra became known for its sophisticated arrangements, blending blues, hard bop, and modern jazz harmonies, and for supporting dynamic soloists with inventive orchestrations[3][4].

Wilson's legacy is marked by his influential role as a composer and arranger, his mentorship of younger musicians, and his ability to adapt his style across decades. He received numerous accolades, including induction into the Mississippi Jazz Hall of Fame, six Grammy nominations, and the NEA Jazz Masters Fellowship[2]. His work influenced generations of jazz artists, and his compositions, such as 'Viva Tirado,' achieved crossover success, being recorded in multiple genres[5].

- He taught jazz at California State University, Northridge, and hosted a daily radio show in Los Angeles during the 1970s and 1980s[6].
- Wilson's arrangements often featured complex harmonies, such as eight-part harmony and five separate saxophone lines, avoiding doublings[4].
- He received six Grammy nominations and his life's work has been archived by the Library of Congress[2].
