## Biography
Myron Carlton "Tiny" Bradshaw (September 23, 1907 – November 26, 1958) was an influential American jazz and rhythm and blues bandleader, singer, composer, pianist, and drummer. Born in Youngstown, Ohio, Bradshaw initially pursued academics, earning a degree in psychology from Wilberforce University before turning to music. His early career saw him performing as a vocalist and drummer with Horace Henderson's Collegians and later with prominent New York jazz ensembles such as Marion Hardy's Alabamians, the Savoy Bearcats, the Mills Blue Rhythm Band, and Luis Russell's Orchestra.

In 1934, Bradshaw formed his own swing orchestra in New York City, recording for Decca Records and headlining venues like the Harlem Opera House. His band was known for energetic swing and boogie-woogie, and he achieved notable success with recordings such as "Shout, Sister, Shout" and "The Darktown Strutters’ Ball." By the late 1940s, Bradshaw had transitioned into rhythm and blues, signing with King Records and scoring several hits, most notably "Well Oh Well" (1950) and "The Train Kept A-Rollin'" (1951). The latter became a foundational track for rock and roll, later covered by artists including Johnny Burnette, The Yardbirds, Aerosmith, and Motörhead, and cited as an inspiration by Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin.

Bradshaw's dynamic arrangements and jump blues style made him a key figure bridging swing, R&B, and early rock and roll. Despite suffering two strokes in the 1950s, he continued to influence the evolving sound of American popular music until his death in Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1958.
