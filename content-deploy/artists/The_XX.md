## Biography
The xx are an English alternative band formed in 2005 in Wandsworth, London, by childhood friends Romy Madley Croft (guitar, vocals) and Oliver Sim (bass guitar, vocals), later joined by Jamie Smith (aka Jamie xx, beats, production) and originally Baria Qureshi (keyboard, guitar)[2][3][5][6]. The members met while attending Elliott School in Putney, South London, a school known for producing musical talent[7]. Their early music was crafted in a small garage, reflecting the band's minimalist ethos and nocturnal creativity, as they quietly recorded to avoid waking their parents[1].

The xx debuted in 2009 with their self-titled album 'xx,' which quickly garnered critical acclaim and won the Mercury Prize in 2010[1][2][3]. Their sound, characterized by soft guitar, prominent bass, ambient soundscapes, and dual vocals, blends indie pop, electronic, dream pop, and R&B influences[1][2][3]. The band continued their success with 'Coexist' (2012) and 'I See You' (2017), both praised for their restrained, atmospheric production and emotional depth[1][2]. Their music has been featured in major films and TV series, and their influence is evident in the rise of genres like lo-fi and bedroom pop[1].

The xx's legacy is marked by their subtle yet powerful impact on contemporary pop, electronic, and indie music. Their innovative approach to minimalism and emotional songwriting has inspired a new generation of artists, and their fingerprints can be found in hits by superstars such as Rihanna, Drake, and Lorde[1]. The band remains active, with members also pursuing successful solo and collaborative projects.
