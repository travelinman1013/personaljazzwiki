## Biography
Brian Carrick & His New Orleans Heritage Jazz Band is one of several working names for the groups led by British clarinetist and tenor saxophonist **Brian Carrick** (b. 1943, South Shields, UK), a specialist in traditional New Orleans jazz.[2][3] Growing up in northeast England, Carrick became deeply drawn to the classic New Orleans sound and, from the early 1970s, began making regular trips to New Orleans to absorb the music at its source, especially the Preservation Hall tradition.[3][4] His first visit to the city was in 1973, and after years of touring as a visiting European musician he finally obtained a work permit in 1993, which allowed him to perform extensively with local veterans and consolidate his reputation as a stylist in the old New Orleans clarinet and tenor-sax idiom.[4]

From the 1990s onward, Carrick organized a succession of bands under names such as **Brian Carrick & His New Orleans Heritage Band**, **Brian Carrick and His Heritage Hall Stompers**, and **Brian Carrick’s Algiers Stompers**, all dedicated to preserving the rough-edged, ensemble-driven style of classic Crescent City jazz.[2][3] His groups focused on repertoire associated with Kid Thomas Valentine, Paul Barbarin, and other mid‑20th‑century New Orleans figures, emphasizing collective improvisation, spirituals, stomps, and blues rather than modern jazz stylings.[3][5] Working between the UK, continental Europe, and New Orleans, Carrick’s bands became a bridge between British traditional‑jazz circles and older New Orleans players, helping sustain interest in pre‑bop New Orleans music into the late 20th and early 21st century.[3][4][5]
