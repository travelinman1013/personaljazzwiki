## Biography
The AFO Executives were a backing band formed in the early 1960s as part of the All For One (AFO) Records collective in New Orleans. Founded by Harold Battiste Jr., the group consisted of elite New Orleans studio musicians including Harold Battiste (arranger/composer), Red Tyler (saxophone), Roy Montrell (guitar), Peter "Chuck" Badie (bass), John Boudreaux (drums), and Melvin Lastie (cornet). These musicians were already established as the house band for AFO Records, where they had contributed to the label's breakout hit "I Know (You Don't Love Me No More)" by Barbara George in 1961, which reached #3 on the Hot 100 chart.

In 1963, when Battiste and other AFO collective members relocated to Los Angeles seeking greater commercial success, the AFO Executives took on a pivotal new role as the backup band for Sam Cooke and other artists on his SAR Records label. This collaboration lasted until Cooke's death in 1964, with the band contributing to significant recordings including "Tennessee Waltz" and "A Change Is Gonna Come." During their Los Angeles period, the group also supported vocalist Tami Lynn, who had recorded the album "Compendium" with AFO Records. The AFO Executives represented a musicians' collective built on the principle that "New Orleans musicians that make the music should make the money," rather than out-of-town record companies.

Following Sam Cooke's death, the collective gradually dissolved as members pursued individual projects. Battiste went on to become musical director for "The Sonny & Cher Show" and produced all of the duo's gold records, while Melvin Lastie continued producing hits like "(Going to the) Chapel of Love" for the Dixie Cups and worked with Willie Bobo. The AFO Executives' legacy lies in their role as pioneering African American musician-owned enterprise and their contribution to the distinctive New Orleans sound that influenced R&B and soul music in the 1960s.
