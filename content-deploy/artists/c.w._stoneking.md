## Biography
C.W. Stoneking, born Chris Stoneking in 1974 in Katherine, Northern Territory, Australia, to American parents who separated soon after his birth, spent his early childhood primarily with his father, a teacher in remote back-country settlements, including time in the Aboriginal community of Papunya until age nine, before relocating to Sydney.[1][2][3] Raised amid diverse influences, he discovered his father's collection of 1920s and 1930s country blues tapes as a Balmain High School student, igniting a lifelong passion for artists like Blind Willie McTell, Memphis Minnie, Leroy Carr, Big Bill Broonzy, Son House, Robert Johnson, Skip James, and Bukka White, alongside ragtime, hokum, gospel, Chicago blues, calypso, jungle jazz, hillbilly, and New Orleans styles.[1][4] Starting guitar at 11 and playing in local bands by 13, including the Woodford Cajun-Zydeco Hot Tamale Band led by Peter Lucas, he moved to Melbourne in 1997, released a private covers album in 1998, and formed the short-lived C.W. Stoneking & the Blue Tits, which disbanded after mandolin player Charlie Bostock's death.[1]

Stoneking's career gained momentum with his debut original album *King Hokum* (2005, released 2006 in Australia, 2007 in Europe), earning critical acclaim for its authentic evocation of pre-war blues and related genres, followed by *Jungle Blues* (2009), inspired partly by his survival of a shipwreck off Africa's West Coast, and *Gon’ Boogaloo* (2011).[1][2][3] A neo-blues singer, songwriter, guitarist, Dobro, tenor banjo, and resophonic guitar player, he toured extensively solo and with bands like the Primitive Horn Orchestra—featuring Kirsty Fraser (vocals), Ros Jones (tuba), Ed Farlie (trumpet), and Kynan Robinson (trombone) in Australia, and American lineups in the US—performing across Australia, the UK, Europe, and the US, including US residencies in 2008-2009 that built significant buzz.[1][2][3] His music masterfully blends early 20th-century blues, jazz, jug band, hokum, country, calypso, jump jive, early rock’n’roll, gospel, New Orleans brass, African/Caribbean percussion, and American folk guitar/banjo into a unique, cohesive sound celebrated for its authenticity and raconteur storytelling.[3]

Stoneking's legacy endures as an utterly fascinating musician whose global travels—from Egypt, New Orleans (as a hoodoo doctor’s assistant), Trinidad (learning calypso), isolated farmhouses as a handyman, to Africa post-shipwreck—infuse his work with vivid, heart-of-darkness narratives, establishing him as a bridge between forgotten musical traditions and modern audiences, with three independently released critically acclaimed albums and a larger-than-life stage presence.[2][3][5]

## Fun Facts
- Survived a shipwreck off Africa’s West Coast, which partly inspired his 2009 album *Jungle Blues*, evoking tales of a shipwrecked soul in darkest Africa jungles.[2]
- Worked as an assistant to a hoodoo doctor in New Orleans and learned calypso music during travels in Trinidad.[2][5]
- Real name is Chris; his maternal grandfather was Robert Lindsay Robey, an Appalachian photographer, and his paternal side traces to Charles Sylvester, a quarter-blood Iroquois.[1][2]
- Prized possession is a 1931 National Duolian dobro, chosen because it was loud like those used by busking blues legends such as Blind Boy Fuller.[4]
