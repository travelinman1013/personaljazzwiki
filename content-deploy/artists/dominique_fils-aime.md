## Biography
Dominique Fils-Aimé is a Haitian-Québécois singer, songwriter, and arranger from Montreal, Canada, known for placing the history and emotional weight of African-American musical traditions at the center of her work.[2][5] Born and raised in Montreal to parents who immigrated from Haiti, she first came to broader public attention in 2015 as a contestant on the third season of the Quebec TV singing competition *La Voix*, where she reached the semifinals and began to define a distinctive, introspective vocal style.[2] Drawing on experiences of cultural heritage, identity, and social justice, she developed a body of work that uses blues, jazz, soul, gospel, and R&B as vehicles for reflecting on both historical trauma and collective resilience.[3][6]

Her recording career took shape with the 2018 debut album *Nameless*, conceived as the opening chapter of a trilogy tracing the history of African-American music; the record, steeped in blues textures, confronted silences and sorrows and quickly became a reference recording among audiophiles, while earning prominent slots at the Montreal International Jazz Festival.[2][3][5] She followed in 2019 with *Stay Tuned!*, a more overtly political work framed as a call for revolution, which won the Juno Award for Vocal Jazz Album of the Year, received a Félix award for Best Jazz Album, and was shortlisted for the Polaris Music Prize, cementing her as a leading voice in contemporary vocal jazz.[2][3][7] In 2021 she closed the original trilogy with *Three Little Words*, an album leaning more heavily into soul, again making the Polaris Prize shortlist, and in 2023 she launched a new creative cycle with *Our Roots Run Deep*, an intimate, soul-infused project that won another Juno for Vocal Jazz Album of the Year, garnered a Félix for Jazz Album of the Year, and underscored her evolution from promising newcomer to widely celebrated artist.[2][4][5][8]

Over time, Fils-Aimé’s musical style has come to center on layered vocal harmonies, spacious arrangements, and a jazz-informed approach to phrasing that treats the voice as both lead instrument and ensemble.[4][9] She often foregrounds minimal percussion and subtle accompaniment—piano, guitar, and bass—so that melodic lines, close harmonies, and rhythmic vocal figures carry much of the emotional narrative.[4][6] Beyond her studio work, she has extended her artistic reach through soundtrack composition, earning a nomination for Best Original Music in a Documentary at the Quebec Cinema Awards for her work on the film *Alone (Seuls)*, and by performing at major festivals in North America and Europe, where her concerts emphasize both musical virtuosity and reflective commentary on the histories that inform her songs.[2][3][9]

## Fun Facts
- Dominique Fils-Aimé first gained significant public attention not through an album release but on television, reaching the semifinals of the third season of the Quebec singing competition show *La Voix* in 2015.[2]
- Her first three full-length albums—*Nameless*, *Stay Tuned!*, and *Three Little Words*—were intentionally conceived as a thematic trilogy tracing the history and emotional landscape of African-American blues, jazz, and soul rather than as standalone projects.[2][3][9]
- The debut album *Nameless* became a surprise favorite among high-end audio enthusiasts, being described as an audiophile reference recording and helping her sell out multiple shows at the Montreal International Jazz Festival.[3][5]
- Her album *Our Roots Run Deep* not only launched a new creative trilogy but also continued her streak of critical acclaim by winning the Juno Award for Vocal Jazz Album of the Year and earning a Félix for Jazz Album of the Year in 2024.[2][4][8]
