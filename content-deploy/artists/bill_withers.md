## Biography
Bill Withers, born William Harrison Withers Jr. on July 4, 1938, in Slab Fork, West Virginia, was the youngest of six children in a coal mining family. After his father's death when he was 13, Withers was raised by his mother's family in Beckley, West Virginia. He developed a stutter as a child and often felt like an outsider, but found solace and expression through music. At 17, Withers enlisted in the U.S. Navy, serving for nine years, where he began to nurture his interest in singing and songwriting[1][2].

Withers moved to Los Angeles in 1967, working as a mechanical assembler while recording demos at night, often financing his own sessions. His breakthrough came when his demo reached Clarence Avant of Sussex Records, who paired him with Booker T. Jones to produce his debut album 'Just As I Am' in 1971. The album featured the Grammy-winning "Ain't No Sunshine" and "Grandma's Hands," launching Withers into stardom. He continued to release hits like "Lean on Me," "Use Me," and "Lovely Day," and collaborated with artists such as Grover Washington Jr. on "Just the Two of Us." Withers was known for his warm, conversational vocal style and straightforward, heartfelt songwriting that blended soul, R&B, and folk influences[1][2][3].

Withers' career spanned 18 years, earning him three Grammy Awards and induction into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and National Rhythm and Blues Hall of Fame. He retired from recording in 1985, citing dissatisfaction with the music industry's pressures, and remained a respected figure whose songs continue to inspire generations. His legacy is marked by timeless anthems of empathy and resilience, such as "Lean on Me," which has become a universal hymn of support and solidarity[1][2][3].
