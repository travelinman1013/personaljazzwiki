## Biography
Tyrese Darnell Gibson, born December 30, 1978, in Watts, Los Angeles, California, rose from a challenging upbringing in a single-parent household to become one of R&B’s most recognizable voices. Raised by his mother, Priscilla Murray Gibson, after his father left, Tyrese faced the harsh realities of poverty and gang violence in his neighborhood. Encouraged by a neighbor and later mentored by his high school music teacher, Reggie Andrews, Tyrese began performing in school talent shows and soon landed a life-changing Coca-Cola commercial at age 16, singing the iconic 'Always Coca-Cola' jingle. This exposure led to modeling gigs with Guess and Tommy Hilfiger and set the stage for his music career.

In 1998, Tyrese signed with RCA Records and released his debut single 'Nobody Else,' which reached the Billboard Hot 100. His self-titled debut album followed, earning platinum status and featuring the hit 'Sweet Lady.' Over the years, Tyrese released seven studio albums, blending smooth R&B with elements of quiet storm and hip-hop, and became known for his emotive vocal delivery and romantic ballads. His career expanded into acting, most notably as Roman Pearce in the 'Fast & Furious' franchise, and he has also authored books and produced television. Tyrese’s legacy is marked by his resilience, versatility, and commitment to giving back, notably through his 2000 Watts Foundation supporting youth in his hometown.
