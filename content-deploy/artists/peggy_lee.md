## Biography
Peggy Lee, born Norma Deloris Egstrom on May 26, 1920, in Jamestown, North Dakota, overcame a difficult childhood marked by the early loss of her mother and an abusive stepmother. Music became her refuge, and she began performing with local bands and on radio stations before moving to Chicago, where her talent was discovered by bandleader Benny Goodman. Joining Goodman’s orchestra in the early 1940s, Lee gained national attention with hits like “Why Don’t You Do Right?” and quickly became known for her sultry, understated vocal style that set her apart in the worlds of jazz, pop, and swing.[1][2][3][5][9]

Throughout her seven-decade career, Lee evolved into a multifaceted artist: a Grammy-winning singer, prolific songwriter, actress, and even a painter and poet. She co-wrote and performed songs for Disney’s 'Lady and the Tramp,' voiced several characters in the film, and received an Academy Award nomination for her role in 'Pete Kelly’s Blues.' Lee’s sophisticated approach to music, blending jazz, blues, and pop with poetic lyricism, influenced generations of artists and earned her the title 'Queen of American pop music.' She recorded over 1,100 songs, co-wrote more than 270, and was instrumental in setting legal precedents for artist royalties. Lee passed away on January 21, 2002, in Bel Air, California, leaving a legacy that continues to inspire musicians and audiences worldwide.[2][3][4][6]
