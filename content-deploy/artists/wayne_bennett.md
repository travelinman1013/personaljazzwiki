## Biography
Wayne Talmadge Bennett (December 13, 1932 – November 28, 1992) was an American blues guitarist born in Sulphur, Oklahoma, who later moved with his parents to Ardmore. He began playing guitar in his teens, performing in local bands, and in 1950 joined Amos Milburn's band, recording classics like 'Bad, Bad, Whiskey' and 'One Bourbon, One Scotch, One Beer' in California. By the early 1950s, he relocated to Chicago, playing with King Kolax's band, touring with The Moonglows, and recording with blues luminaries such as Otis Rush, Buddy Guy, Arbee Stidham, Jimmy Reed, and Elmore James.[1]

In the late 1950s, Bennett toured and recorded with the Five Blind Boys of Mississippi before embarking on a decades-long association with Bobby Bland, spanning the late 1950s to mid-1960s and resuming in the mid-1970s to mid-1980s. Renowned for his jazz-tinged blues guitar style influenced by T-Bone Walker, his solos on Bland's 'Stormy Monday' from *Here's The Man* and 'Wishing Well' became classics, inspiring British guitarists like Eric Clapton. Bennett formally studied guitar with Harry Volpe in New York for two years and harmony with Nate Griffin and Junior Mance in Chicago, plus Tony Hanson in Cleveland. He also worked as a house musician at theaters like the Apollo in New York and Regal in Chicago, joined Red Saunders' band in 1965, released his solo instrumental 'Casanova, Your Playing Days are Over' in 1968, and collaborated with jazz artists including Cannonball Adderley, Sonny Stitt, and Dexter Gordon, as well as R&B groups like the Chi-Lites and Hues Corporation.[1]

Bennett's versatile career extended to Operation Breadbasket in the late 1960s and recordings with artists like Jimmy McGriff, Jimmy Reed, Tyrone Davis, and Willy DeVille on *Victory Mixture* in 1990. He died in New Orleans from heart failure at age 59, just before a transplant, and was inducted into the Oklahoma Jazz Hall of Fame in 2001. In 2018, the Killer Blues Headstone Project placed a headstone for him in Providence Cemetery, New Orleans.[1]
