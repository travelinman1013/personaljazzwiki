## Biography
The Brides of Funkenstein were an influential American funk and soul group formed in the late 1970s by vocalists Dawn Silva and Lynn Mabry. Both Silva and Mabry had previously served as background singers for Sly Stone of Sly and the Family Stone before joining the P-Funk collective led by George Clinton in the mid-1970s. Clinton, inspired by the Parliament album 'The Clones of Dr. Funkenstein,' named the group and produced their debut album, 'Funk Or Walk,' released on Atlantic Records in 1978. The album was a commercial and critical success, with the single 'Disco to Go' achieving gold status in the US and platinum in Europe and Asia, and the group winning a Record World award for best new female group.

Following Mabry's departure in 1979, Silva continued the group with new members Sheila Horne and Jeanette McGruder. This lineup recorded the acclaimed album 'Never Buy Texas From A Cowboy,' which received a Cashbox Rhythm & Blues award for best new female artist, surpassing notable acts like The Pointer Sisters and Sister Sledge. The Brides became known for their dynamic live performances, often opening for Parliament-Funkadelic and contributing backing vocals to the ensemble. Although a third album, 'Shadows On The Wall, Shaped Like The Hat You Wore,' was recorded in 1980, it was never officially released, with many of its tracks later appearing in the broader P-Funk catalog.

The Brides of Funkenstein's musical style blended deep funk grooves with soulful harmonies and theatrical flair, reflecting the larger-than-life P-Funk aesthetic. Their legacy endures through their pioneering role as one of the few all-female acts in the male-dominated funk scene, their influence on subsequent generations of funk and R&B artists, and the continued touring and recording activities of Dawn Silva, who has worked with acts such as the Gap Band and Ice Cube.
