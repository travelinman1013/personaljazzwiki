## Biography
Darrel Walls is a gospel and Christian R&B singer known for his dynamic voice and work with the Grammy-nominated sibling quartet, The Walls Group. Details on his early life, such as birthplace or childhood, are not specified in available sources, but he gained prominence as a member of the family group before transitioning to solo projects. His career development includes a debut solo album, *Heart of Mine*, produced by five-time Grammy winner PJ Morton, which earned two Grammy nominations in Best Gospel Album and Best Contemporary Christian Music Performance/Song for the track 'Amazing'.[1]

Walls co-wrote two tracks on *Heart of Mine* and provided background vocals, with sessions recorded at Morton's Studio in the Country in Bogalusa, Louisiana. The project blends gospel, R&B, and contemporary Christian styles, reflecting Walls' roots in gospel music. PJ Morton crafted the seven-track album specifically for Walls' voice as part of his 'Heart of Mine (A PJ Morton Production)' series, which features cross-genre collaborations with rising stars.[1][6]

Walls' legacy includes over 4 million global streams for *Heart of Mine* and recognition as a six-time Grammy nominee. He describes the nominations as surreal, crediting faith and consistency, positioning him as an emerging solo force after group success.[1]
