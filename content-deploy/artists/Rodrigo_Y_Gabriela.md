## Biography
Rodrigo y Gabriela are a Mexican acoustic guitar duo consisting of Rodrigo Sánchez and Gabriela Quintero, both originally from Mexico City. They met as teenagers at the Casa de Cultura, where they bonded over a shared passion for music, particularly classic rock and heavy metal. Their early musical journey began in the thrash metal band Tierra Acida, where they developed a disciplined work ethic and honed their technical skills playing in some of Mexico City's toughest clubs. After the dissolution of Tierra Acida in the late 1990s, the duo decided to leave Mexico and seek new opportunities in Europe.

Arriving in Dublin, Ireland, with little money and no contacts, Rodrigo and Gabriela began busking on Grafton Street. Their virtuosic, percussive guitar style quickly attracted attention, leading to gigs and eventually an invitation from Irish singer-songwriter Damien Rice to open for him. This exposure helped them build a following, and their self-titled 2006 album reached number one on the Irish charts, marking their international breakthrough. Over the years, Rodrigo y Gabriela have released a series of acclaimed albums, blending influences from flamenco, rock, and Latin rhythms, and have become renowned for their energetic live performances. Their career highlights include performing at major venues worldwide, collaborating on film soundtracks, and playing for dignitaries such as President Barack Obama at the White House.

Rodrigo y Gabriela's legacy lies in their innovative approach to acoustic guitar, fusing genres and pushing technical boundaries while remaining accessible to a broad audience. Their music, characterized by intricate melodies, rhythmic strumming, and the use of the guitar body as percussion, has inspired countless musicians and earned them a devoted global fanbase.
