## Biography
Jaimee Harris is a Texas-born singer-songwriter who grew up in Waco and Hewitt, Texas, before relocating to Austin at age 19 to pursue music full-time. She began her musical journey at age five after being mesmerized by Emmylou Harris's Christmas recording "Light of the Stable," which featured backing vocals by Neil Young, Linda Ronstadt, and Dolly Parton. Harris started performing live at age 10, initially playing cover songs during breaks in her father's cover band, Honest Mango. Her early years were shaped by the vibrant Austin music scene, where she sang backup for David Ramirez and performed regularly at venues like the One-2-One club and Strange Brew coffee shop. She achieved sobriety during her time in Austin, which coincided with her emergence as a songwriter and performer in the local folk-Americana community.

Harris's professional music career accelerated when she quit her day job in 2018 to tour as a solo acoustic artist, opening for folk legend Mary Gauthier across Europe. Though her initial tour was challenging—she experienced stage fright and mental health struggles that led to a reduced set—this period proved transformative. Her debut album "Red Rescue" (2018), produced by Craig Ross, established her as a serious songwriter. Her sophomore album "Boomerang Town" (2024) marked a bold artistic step forward, presenting a country-folk-leaning song cycle exploring themes of family, addiction, and the generational struggles of small-town America. The album's title track, reminiscent of Bruce Springsteen's "The River," exemplifies Harris's ability to craft emotionally resonant narratives that blend autobiographical reflection with universal storytelling.

Harris's musical style blends Americana, folk, and rock influences, characterized by acoustic guitar-driven arrangements and sparse instrumentation that foreground her distinctive vocal delivery. Her work reflects her Texas roots and the influence of master songwriters she encountered growing up, while her lyrics often explore themes of displacement, resilience, and the complexities of leaving home. Now based in Nashville, Harris continues to develop her craft as a queer folk singer-songwriter, maintaining her commitment to the album format and the art of songwriting itself.

## Fun Facts
- At age five, Harris became so mesmerized by Emmylou Harris's "Light of the Stable" that she played it repeatedly until it became 'part of her DNA,' inspiring her lifelong musical career. The backing vocals on this recording featured four powerhouse voices: Neil Young, Linda Ronstadt, and Dolly Parton.
- Harris used music as a survival mechanism against childhood bullying. In elementary school, she offered to play guitar for three popular girls who wanted to perform 'Wide Open Spaces' at a talent show but couldn't find a backing track. After the performance, the bullying slowed down significantly.
- Harris's first solo acoustic tour in Europe in 2018 was so difficult that she experienced a mental breakdown on stage in Amsterdam, which resulted in her set being reduced to just one song. This humbling experience ultimately led to transformative mentorship from Mary Gauthier.
- Harris is a self-described 'queer folk singer-songwriter' who, when not performing, enjoys playing pinball. She turned 30 during the COVID-19 pandemic, a milestone that coincided with the creative reflection that shaped her album 'Boomerang Town.'
