## Biography
Jalacy "Screamin' Jay" Hawkins (July 18, 1929 – February 12, 2000) was an American singer, songwriter, and actor, best remembered for his flamboyant stage persona and the iconic hit "I Put a Spell on You." Born in Cleveland, Ohio, Hawkins spent his early years in an orphanage before being adopted. A piano prodigy, he taught himself to play and could read music by age six. Initially aspiring to be an opera singer, inspired by Paul Robeson and Mario Lanza, Hawkins' ambitions shifted after military service in World War II and a stint as a Golden Gloves boxing champion[1][2][4].

In the early 1950s, Hawkins worked with artists like Tiny Grimes and Fats Domino before launching his solo career. His breakthrough came in 1956 with the raucous, voodoo-infused recording of "I Put a Spell on You," a song originally intended as a ballad but transformed during a famously inebriated studio session. Encouraged by DJ Alan Freed, Hawkins developed a theatrical, macabre stage act—emerging from coffins, wielding skull props, and donning outlandish costumes—which made him a pioneer of shock rock and a cult figure in the U.S., Europe, and Japan[1][2][3][4].

Hawkins' influence extended beyond his own recordings, as his unique blend of blues, soul, and theatricality inspired generations of musicians. He continued to perform internationally, appeared in films, and remained a larger-than-life figure until his death in France in 2000[1][2][3].

## Fun Facts
- Hawkins originally wrote "I Put a Spell on You" as a ballad, but the hit version was recorded after a night of heavy drinking, resulting in the wild vocal style that became his trademark[1][3].
- He was an accomplished boxer, winning a Golden Gloves championship in 1943 and becoming the middleweight boxing champion of Alaska in 1949[2].
- His stage act, which included emerging from coffins and using skull props, was so outrageous that the NAACP criticized it for perpetuating negative stereotypes[1].
- Hawkins claimed he fathered dozens of children, and a 2001 documentary titled "I Put a Spell on Me" explored his colorful life and legacy[3].
