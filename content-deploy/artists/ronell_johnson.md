## Biography
Ronell Johnson is a New Orleans–born trombonist, tubist and vocalist best known for his work with the Preservation Hall Jazz Band. A native of the city’s Gentilly neighborhood, he grew up in a highly musical family and began performing in public around the age of six, absorbing the brass band and traditional jazz sounds that surround everyday life in New Orleans.[1] He came up through local school music programs and community ensembles, developing into a versatile low‑brass player equally at home in traditional jazz, funk, and brass band settings, and eventually joined the storied Preservation Hall Jazz Band, carrying forward the city’s early jazz traditions for contemporary audiences worldwide.[1]

As a bandleader and recording artist, Johnson has released projects under his own name that spotlight his warm trombone sound, agile tuba work, and soulful, often humorous vocals, notably the album "That Gentilly Swing" (2017), which nods to his neighborhood roots and blends classic New Orleans swing with modern arrangements.[3][4] His playing emphasizes strong melodic phrasing, a deep groove, and a vocal approach to improvisation that reflects the influence of both classic jazz trombonists and the call‑and‑response character of New Orleans street music.[1][2] Through touring internationally with Preservation Hall and collaborating with local musicians at home, he has become part of the continuing lineage of New Orleans jazz ambassadors, helping to keep traditional repertoire vibrant while introducing it to new listeners across generations.[1][2]

Johnson’s legacy so far is that of a tradition bearer who also personalizes the idiom with his own compositional voice and ensemble concepts. By featuring piano, voice, and flexible rhythm section textures on his recordings, he presents New Orleans jazz not as a museum piece but as a living, adaptive style that can encompass ballads, showtunes, and dance‑driven swing alike.[3][4] His work with Preservation Hall places him in a direct line with some of the city’s most respected elders, and his growing discography under his own name documents a modern Gentilly‑raised musician contributing new stories and sounds to the city’s long jazz narrative.[1][4]
