## Biography
Humphrey Richard Adeane Lyttelton (1921–2008), known affectionately as 'Humph,' was born at Eton College, Buckinghamshire, England, where his father was a housemaster. Raised in a musically inclined family, Lyttelton discovered jazz at age 15 and, inspired by the likes of Louis Armstrong and Nat Gonella, taught himself trumpet—having only one formal lesson in his life. After serving in the British Army during World War II, he attended Camberwell School of Art, where he met lifelong friend and clarinetist Wally Fawkes.

Lyttelton's professional music career began in 1947 with George Webb’s Dixielanders, one of Britain’s pioneering traditional jazz bands. By 1948, he had formed his own band, quickly becoming the leading force in the British jazz revival, especially in New Orleans and Dixieland styles. His group recorded prolifically, including a historic 1949 session with Sidney Bechet, and achieved mainstream success with 'Bad Penny Blues' in 1956—the first British jazz record to enter the UK Top Twenty. Over the decades, Lyttelton’s band evolved stylistically, incorporating swing and modern jazz elements, and toured extensively across Europe and the United States.

Beyond music, Lyttelton was a celebrated broadcaster, hosting BBC Radio 2’s 'The Best of Jazz' for over thirty years and becoming a household name as the witty chairman of the comedy panel show 'I’m Sorry I Haven’t a Clue.' He was also an accomplished author, cartoonist, and journalist, leaving an indelible mark on British culture as both a jazz ambassador and a beloved media personality.
