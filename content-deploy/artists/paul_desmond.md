## Biography
Paul Desmond was born Paul Emil Breitenfeld on November 25, 1924, in San Francisco, California. His father, a pianist and organist in silent films, introduced him to music early on. Desmond initially played the clarinet before transitioning to the alto saxophone. He met pianist Dave Brubeck during his military service in 1944, and they later formed the Dave Brubeck Quartet in 1951. This partnership lasted for seventeen years and included hits like *Jazz at Oberlin* and *Jazz Goes to College*. Desmond's most famous composition, *Take Five*, was a groundbreaking piece in 5/4 time that became a huge success. After the quartet disbanded in 1967, Desmond continued to record and perform with other notable musicians like Gerry Mulligan and Jim Hall. He was known for his fluid, airy playing style and clear tone. Desmond passed away in 1977 due to lung cancer. His legacy includes not only his contributions to jazz but also his bequest of *Take Five* royalties to the Red Cross.

Desmond's musical style was characterized by a cool, melodic approach that complemented Brubeck's polytonal playing. He was a key figure in popularizing jazz through college tours and international performances. His work spanned genres from cool jazz to bossa nova, reflecting his versatility as a composer and performer.

Throughout his career, Desmond maintained a strong connection with his musical community, often collaborating with other jazz legends. His influence on jazz extends beyond his own compositions, as his unique sound and style have inspired generations of musicians.
