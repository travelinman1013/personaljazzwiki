## Biography
Hudson is a jazz supergroup formed by four of the most acclaimed musicians in contemporary jazz: drummer Jack DeJohnette, bassist Larry Grenadier, keyboardist John Medeski, and guitarist John Scofield. The group takes its name and inspiration from the Hudson River Valley in New York, where all four members reside. Their collaboration was sparked at the Woodstock Jazz Festival in 2014, where their immediate chemistry led to the formation of the band. Each member brings decades of experience and a distinctive voice to the ensemble, resulting in a dynamic blend of jazz, rock, soul, and improvisational music.

The group released their self-titled debut album, 'Hudson,' in 2017, featuring original compositions and reinterpretations of classics by artists such as Bob Dylan, The Band, Joni Mitchell, and Jimi Hendrix. Their music reflects both the rich musical heritage of the Hudson Valley and the universal character of jazz, marked by adventurous improvisation and deep grooves. Hudson is celebrated for its egalitarian spirit, with each member contributing equally to the group's creative direction, and for its ability to make familiar material feel fresh and vital through collective interplay.

Individually, DeJohnette, Grenadier, Medeski, and Scofield have shaped the landscape of modern jazz through their work with a wide array of legendary artists and bands. Together, Hudson stands as a testament to the collaborative and boundary-pushing ethos of jazz, earning critical acclaim for their innovative approach and virtuosic musicianship.
