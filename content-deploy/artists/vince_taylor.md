## Biography
Vince Taylor, born Brian Maurice Holden on July 14, 1939, in Isleworth, Middlesex, England, moved with his family to the United States in 1946, first to New Jersey and later to California around 1955. There, influenced by Elvis Presley and Gene Vincent, he began performing in Los Angeles nightclubs, adopting a leather-clad rock 'n' roll persona. His sister had married Joe Barbera of Hanna-Barbera, providing a Hollywood connection. Returning to the UK in 1958, Taylor formed Vince Taylor and the Playboys, signing with Parlophone Records and releasing early singles like 'Right Behind You Baby' and the iconic 'Brand New Cadillac,' which emulated American rockabilly with raw energy despite vocal limitations.[2][3][4][5]

The band achieved a top 15 UK hit with 'Jet Black Machine' in 1960 and gained prominence in France after signing with Barclay Records, releasing EPs, an LP titled 'Le Rock c'est ça,' and touring extensively. Taylor's magnetic stage presence overshadowed band tensions caused by his unreliability, leading to frequent lineup changes, including departures of bassist Brian 'Licorice' Locking and drummer Brian Bennett to The Shadows. His style blended rock 'n' roll and rockabilly, covering classics like Eddie Cochran's 'C'mon Everybody.' However, drug use—acid mixed with alcohol and amphetamines—escalated, culminating in a 1964 onstage breakdown where he declared himself the prophet Matthew, derailing his career.[1][2][3][4]

Taylor's later years were marked by instability, band breakups, and sporadic performances, including opening for the Rolling Stones in Paris in 1964-1965. He moved to Switzerland after marrying Nathalie Minster in 1983, addressed alcoholism in a 1987 detox clinic, and lived quietly until dying of cancer on August 27, 1991, at age 52. His wild persona and tragic arc inspired David Bowie's Ziggy Stardust character, cementing his legacy as a pioneering British rocker with an authentic American sound.[1][2][3][6]
