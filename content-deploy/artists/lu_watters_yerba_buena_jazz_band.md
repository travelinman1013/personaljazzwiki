## Biography
Lu Watters & the Yerba Buena Jazz Band was a pioneering American traditional jazz **revival** band formed in the San Francisco Bay Area in 1939–1940 by cornetist Lucius “Lu” Watters, at a time when big‑band swing dominated popular taste.[1][2][3] Watters, who had spent the 1930s playing commercial dance gigs and touring with the Carol Lofner big band, became deeply attracted to early New Orleans jazz during a tour stop in New Orleans and returned to California determined to recreate the hot ensemble sound of King Oliver and Jelly Roll Morton rather than the arranged swing then in fashion.[1][2][3] He began informal jam sessions in the Oakland hills with like‑minded musicians including Bill Dart, Clancy Hayes, Bob Helm, Dick Lammi, Turk Murphy, and Wally Rose, gradually shaping a repertoire and sound that rejected post‑1930 jazz practices in favor of a rougher, polyphonic ensemble style.[1][2][3]

In 1938 Watters led a band at Sweet’s Ballroom in Oakland that already featured Hayes, Helm, Squire Gersh, Bob Scobey, and Russell Bennett, quietly slipping traditional New Orleans pieces into dance programs until management fired him, pushing him further toward a full‑time revivalist project.[2][3] In 1939 he formally established the Yerba Buena Jazz Band—named after the original name of San Francisco—with a frontline modeled on King Oliver’s Creole Jazz Band and an expanded lineup that soon included trombonist Turk Murphy and pianist Forrest Browne, who introduced the group to Jelly Roll Morton compositions.[1][2] From 1940 the band became a fully fledged “musical rebellion” against big‑band swing, championing collective improvisation, driving but relaxed tempos, and contrapuntal ensemble lines over individual star soloing.[1][2][3] They built a devoted following at San Francisco’s Dawn Club, where critics later described them as “America’s first real revivalist band,” and their recordings—many later reissued on labels such as Good Time Jazz—helped ignite a worldwide traditional jazz revival.[1][2][5]

The Yerba Buena Jazz Band’s core style combined Watters’s arranged but earthy takes on early jazz with a repertoire of rags, stomps, and blues, often drawn from King Oliver and Morton alongside original pieces tailored to the band’s powerful two‑cornet and trombone front line.[1][2][3] World War II briefly interrupted their run when Watters entered the U.S. Navy in 1942, but the band reconvened in the mid‑1940s, again working the Dawn Club and then moving to Hambone Kelly’s, a restaurant‑club opened by Watters in 1947 where the group broadcast regularly and cemented its reputation.[1][2][7] By 1950 internal changes, including the departures of key players Bob Scobey and Turk Murphy to lead their own bands, led Watters to disband the Yerba Buena group, with critics later noting that by that point the traditional jazz revival had been securely launched through a decade of broadcasts and recordings.[2] Although the band itself was relatively short‑lived, its historically oriented yet hard‑driving sound influenced generations of West Coast and international revivalist musicians and remains a reference point in discussions of the early‑jazz revival.

## Fun Facts
- The band’s name, Yerba Buena, comes from the original name of San Francisco, underlining how closely the group tied its identity to the city whose jazz scene it helped transform.[1][2]
- Watters and his colleagues deliberately rejected almost all post‑1930 jazz practices, positioning the Yerba Buena Jazz Band as a self‑conscious “revolt” against big‑band swing and what they viewed as overly sophisticated written arrangements.[3]
- The band’s first rehearsals took place at the Big Bear Lodge on Redwood Road in the Oakland hills, where Watters gathered like‑minded musicians for jam sessions focused on pre‑swing New Orleans styles.[1][2]
- After World War II, Watters opened his own venue, Hambone Kelly’s, where the Yerba Buena Jazz Band performed and broadcast regularly before disbanding; surviving KLX radio recordings from the club document the band at its late‑1940s peak.[2][7]

## Musical Connections

### Mentors/Influences
- [[king_oliver|King Oliver]] - Primary stylistic model; Watters formed the Yerba Buena Jazz Band specifically to revive Oliver’s 1923 New Orleans ensemble style of rich polyphony, relaxed but driving tempos, and collective improvisation rather than solo‑centric swing. (Recreation of King Oliver’s Creole Jazz Band repertoire and ensemble approach in Yerba Buena arrangements and performances.) [Conceptual influence from early 1920s recordings; explicitly adopted by Watters around 1939–1940.]
- [[jelly_roll_morton|Jelly Roll Morton]] - Major compositional and repertoire influence; pianist Forrest Browne taught the band Morton pieces, integrating his structured yet hot idiom into their book. (Morton compositions added to the band’s repertoire at the Dawn Club and in early 1940s recordings.) [Influence became concrete after Browne joined around 1939–1940 and continued through the 1940s.]

### Key Collaborators
- [[clancy_hayes|Clancy Hayes]] - Singer, banjoist, and core band member from the early Oakland jam sessions into the Yerba Buena years; also worked with related small groups like the Clancy Hayes Washboard Five during a late‑1940s hiatus. (Performances and recordings with Lu Watters’ Yerba Buena Jazz Band; Clancy Hayes Washboard Five sessions.) [Late 1930s–1950.[1][2][3][5]]
- [[bob_helm|Bob Helm]] - Clarinetist whose robust, contrapuntal playing was central to the band’s Oliver‑style front line and to many classic Yerba Buena recordings. (Numerous live broadcasts and studio sides with Lu Watters’ Yerba Buena Jazz Band documented from 1941 onward.[1][5]) [Late 1930s jam sessions; main band member through the 1940s.[1][2][5]]
- [[bob_scobey|Bob Scobey]] - Second cornetist who shared the trumpet front line with Watters on many key Yerba Buena recordings before leaving to lead his own traditional jazz band. (Two‑cornet recordings from the mid‑1940s, including 1946 Avalon Ballroom and Dawn Club broadcasts.[1][2][5]) [Late 1930s with Watters’s pre‑Yerba Buena band; principal Yerba Buena member through the 1940s until his departure before 1950.[1][2][5]]
- [[turk_murphy|Turk Murphy]] - Trombonist whose powerful tailgate style anchored the ensemble sound; later a major bandleader of the San Francisco traditional jazz revival in his own right. (Core trombone on Yerba Buena recordings and broadcasts in the 1940s, including Good Time Jazz releases from 1946–1947 sessions.[1][2][5]) [From Watters’s Oakland jam sessions in the late 1930s through to his departure to form his own band before 1950.[1][2][3][5]]
- [[wally_rose|Wally Rose]] - Pianist whose ragtime‑ and Morton‑influenced playing underpinned the band’s repertoire of rags and stomps. (Featured pianist on Yerba Buena’s early‑1940s Jazz Man sides and mid‑1940s Good Time Jazz recordings.[1][5]) [Late 1930s jam sessions and throughout the 1940s Yerba Buena period.[1][2][5]]
- [[dick_lammi|Dick Lammi]] - Tubist and bassist providing the band’s characteristic low‑brass foundation, integral to its pre‑swing sound. (Recorded on numerous Yerba Buena sessions from 1941 onward, including Jazz Man and Good Time Jazz releases.[1][5]) [From early jam sessions in the late 1930s through the main 1940s Yerba Buena run.[1][2][5]]
- [[bill_dart|Bill Dart]] - Drummer whose driving but non‑modern drum style matched the band’s pre‑1930 aesthetic and helped define its rhythmic feel. (House drummer on Yerba Buena recordings and broadcasts throughout the 1940s.[1][5]) [Late 1930s jam sessions through at least 1950 with the Yerba Buena band.[1][2][3][5]]
- [[forrest_browne|Forrest Browne]] - Pianist who, before being replaced by Wally Rose, crucially expanded the band’s book by teaching them Jelly Roll Morton works. (Early Yerba Buena club performances featuring Morton repertoire at the Dawn Club.[1][2]) [Around the formation of the Yerba Buena Jazz Band, circa 1939–1940.[1][2]]

### Artists Influenced
- [[west_coast_traditional_jazz_revivalists_including_later_bands_led_by_former_members_such_as_turk_murphy_and_bob_scobey|West Coast traditional jazz revivalists (including later bands led by former members such as Turk Murphy and Bob Scobey)]] - Jazz writers credit Lu Watters & the Yerba Buena Jazz Band as perhaps the most vital factor in reawakening public interest in traditional jazz on the U.S. West Coast, launching a broader revival that former members and contemporaries carried forward. (Subsequent traditional jazz recordings and bands on the West Coast that drew on the Yerba Buena model of Oliver‑style ensemble playing and early repertoire; specific discographies lie beyond the immediate Yerba Buena sources but are repeatedly linked back to the band’s 1940s recordings and broadcasts.[2]) [From the 1940s revival period onward, particularly after the band’s breakup in 1950 when alumni led their own groups.[2]]
