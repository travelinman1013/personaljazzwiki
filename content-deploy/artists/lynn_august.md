## Biography
Joseph Leonard August Jr. (August 7, 1948 – February 12, 2025), known professionally as **Lynn August**, was an American zydeco accordionist, keyboard player, singer, and bandleader from Lafayette, Louisiana.[1][3] Born with severely impaired vision that progressed to total blindness around age four, he attended the Louisiana State School for the Blind in Baton Rouge, where he deepened his early love of Creole and zydeco music that he had first absorbed at home and through the playing of his uncle, accordionist Claude Duffy.[1][3][6] By age eleven he was already working as a drummer and occasional singer in Duffy’s band, and soon afterward he began performing six nights a week in New Orleans, where the flamboyant rock‑and‑roll pioneer Esquerita took him under his wing, encouraged him to study piano and organ, and exposed him to professional touring life.[1][3][5]

Throughout the 1960s August worked both as a sideman and a soloist, playing drums in the early band of Stanley "Buckwheat" Dural (later Buckwheat Zydeco), recording his first single "Little Red Rooster" for the local Tamm label in 1966, and leading his own group in local clubs before returning to solo gigs after a barroom brawl.[1][3] In the 1970s he balanced secular work with church music, directing a choir and playing organ in accordionist Marcel Dugas’ band, then turned decisively toward zydeco in the 1980s by taking up accordion and forming **Lynn August & the Hot August Knights**, with whom he recorded his debut album *Zydeco Groove* in 1988 and followed with *Creole Cruiser* (1992) and *Sauce Piquante* (1993) for the Maison de Soul and Black Top labels.[1][3] His music blended traditional zydeco and Cajun rhythms with R&B, gospel, and the older Creole *juré* tradition of a cappella group singing, clapping, and dancing, a style he helped revive in modern performance.[1] August toured internationally in the 1990s, started a technology company for visually impaired users, overcame open‑heart surgery in 1998, and continued to perform and record into the 21st century, including the 2012 album *Legends Making Memories* with Willie‑Tee Trahan and Cypress, cementing his reputation as a bridge between classic Creole roots and contemporary zydeco.[1][3]

August remained a respected figure on the Gulf Coast music scene well into his later years, appearing at events such as the Swamp Pop Reunion and being remembered in his hometown as both a virtuoso and a generous mentor to younger musicians.[3][4] His legacy rests on his powerful, soulful vocals; his command of accordion, organ, and keyboards; and his ability to honor older Creole forms while updating them for festival stages and international audiences, making him one of the notable bearers of Louisiana’s Creole and zydeco traditions in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.[1][3][6]

## Fun Facts

- As a preteen he played six nights a week at the Peppermint Lounge in New Orleans’ French Quarter, where his band opened for Esquerita, who then hired him full‑time.[3]
- He recorded his first single, a version of “Little Red Rooster,” for the local Tamm label in 1966, pairing it with “Let Them Talk” on the B‑side.[1][3]
- In the mid‑1990s he founded a company called Touch Tech, designing and selling computers for visually impaired people, combining his lived experience with technology entrepreneurship alongside his music career.[1][3]

## Musical Connections

### Mentors/Influences
- [[esquerita_eskew_reeder_jr|Esquerita (Eskew Reeder Jr.)]] - Rock-and-roll singer and pianist who hired August as a drummer in his band, encouraged him to learn piano and organ, and urged him toward a solo career while they worked mainly around New Orleans. (August later recorded Esquerita’s song “Undivided Love,” included on his 1992 album *Creole Cruiser* as a tribute.) [c. 1960–1963[1][3][5]]
- [[claude_duffy|Claude Duffy]] - August’s uncle, a Creole accordionist whose band gave him his first professional experience as a drummer and occasional singer, grounding him in local zydeco tradition. (Live performances with the Duffy band in the Lafayette area.) [Late 1950s–early 1960s[1][3]]

### Key Collaborators
- [[stanley_buckwheat_dural_buckwheat_zydeco|Stanley “Buckwheat” Dural (Buckwheat Zydeco)]] - August played drums with Dural in the early 1960s before Dural became famous as Buckwheat Zydeco, connecting him to another major figure in modern zydeco. (Early live performances with Dural’s pre–Buckwheat Zydeco band.) [Early 1960s[1][3]]
- [[john_hart|John Hart]] - Saxophonist who co‑founded August’s band **Lynn August & the Hot August Knights**, helping shape the horn‑driven sound of August’s late‑1980s zydeco recordings. (Band work on *Zydeco Groove* (1988) and live festival performances with the Hot August Knights.) [Late 1980s–early 1990s[3]]
- [[marcel_dugas_often_cited_as_marcel_sugarmarcel_dugas|Marcel Dugas (often cited as Marcel “Sugar”/Marcel Dugas)]] - Accordionist who recruited August as organist for his band, bringing him more deeply into the zydeco circuit before August fully committed to accordion and bandleading. (Live performances with Dugas’ band in the late 1970s.) [Late 1970s[1][3]]
- [[willie-tee_trahan_and_cypress|Willie-Tee Trahan and Cypress]] - Collaborators on a late‑career project that paired August with another Louisiana act, reflecting his ongoing engagement with regional roots music. (Album *Legends Making Memories* (2012), credited to Lynn August with Willie‑Tee Trahan and Cypress.) [2012[1][3]]

### Artists Influenced
- [[younger_louisiana_creole_and_zydeco_musicians_general|Younger Louisiana Creole and zydeco musicians (general)]] - August is described in regional tributes as a highly respected musician and one of the great zydeco artists of his generation, and his revival of *juré* styles and blend of organ, R&B, and zydeco has been cited as part of the modern zydeco vocabulary, but specific named protégés are not clearly documented in available sources. (Influence most evident in later zydeco recordings that incorporate Creole *juré* elements and keyboard‑driven arrangements, though no particular artists are explicitly named in the sources.) [1990s–2020s (inferred from career span and regional recognition)[1][3][4][6]]
