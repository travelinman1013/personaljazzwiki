## Biography
Sun Ra, born Herman Poole Blount on May 22, 1914, in Birmingham, Alabama, was a visionary American jazz composer, bandleader, pianist, synthesizer player, and poet whose career spanned six decades and left an indelible mark on the avant-garde and free jazz movements[1][2][3]. Ra grew up in Birmingham, where he studied piano under Fess Wheatley and later attended Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical College (now University)[3]. By the mid-1940s, he had relocated to Chicago, immersing himself in the city’s vibrant jazz scene and working as a pianist and arranger for nightclub floor shows[1][3]. In 1946–47, he apprenticed with swing bandleader Fletcher Henderson, a formative experience that honed his skills in arrangement and big band leadership[3][4].

In the early 1950s, Blount adopted the name Le Sony’r Ra (later shortened to Sun Ra), claiming extraterrestrial origins and developing a cosmic philosophy that became central to his artistic identity[1][2]. He founded his ensemble, The Arkestra, which became renowned for its eclectic instrumentation, theatrical performances, and ever-evolving lineup[1][2]. Sun Ra’s music synthesized elements from across jazz history—ragtime, swing, bebop, hard bop, free jazz, and fusion—while pioneering the use of electronic instruments like the Minimoog synthesizer and electric piano[1][2][4]. His work also incorporated poetry, dance, and elaborate costumes, creating a multidisciplinary spectacle that prefigured the Afrofuturism movement[1][2][5]. Despite health challenges later in life, Sun Ra continued to perform and compose until his death in 1993, leaving behind a vast catalog of recordings and a legacy as one of jazz’s most innovative and enigmatic figures[1][2][3].
