## Biography
Celestin's Original Tuxedo Jazz Orchestra was a pioneering New Orleans jazz band led by trumpeter and vocalist Oscar “Papa” Celestin, one of the early standard-bearers of traditional New Orleans jazz.[1][7] The group took its name from the Tuxedo Dance Hall in New Orleans, where it became a resident band, and dates its origins to around 1910, when Celestin formed what came to be known as the Original Tuxedo Orchestra.[2][7] Born in New Orleans in 1884, Celestin built his reputation in the city’s vibrant dance-hall and parade scene, and by the 1910s his orchestra was an important fixture in local entertainment, playing for dances, parades, and social events at a time when ragtime, marching-band music, and early jazz were blending into a new idiom.[1][2][7]

Over the 1910s and 1920s, the Original Tuxedo Jazz Orchestra developed a tight, ensemble-based style typical of early New Orleans jazz, marked by driving collective improvisation, a two-beat rhythmic feel, and a repertoire that mixed blues, rags, popular songs, and traditional dance tunes.[1][3][7] Celestin’s cornet playing and leadership gave the band a strong melodic lead and a lively, vocal-inflected approach, as heard on mid‑1920s recordings from New Orleans sessions such as “Original Tuxedo Rag” (recorded January 23, 1925) and later sides from April 1926.[3][4] These records document the group’s role in codifying the classic New Orleans ensemble sound—front line horns (cornet, trombone, clarinet/sax) over a banjo‑piano‑drums rhythm section—at a moment when jazz was beginning to reach a national audience.[3][4][7]

Although the membership of the band changed over time, Celestin maintained the Original Tuxedo name for decades, and the orchestra became a symbol of continuity for traditional jazz in New Orleans.[1][7] By the 1950s, he was widely regarded as a veteran pioneer of the style, and later reconstituted versions of his Tuxedo band continued to perform and record, preserving the repertoire and performance practice of early New Orleans jazz for new listeners.[1] Through its long career in local venues and on recordings, Celestin’s Original Tuxedo Jazz Orchestra helped define the sound and feel of New Orleans ensemble jazz, bridging ragtime-era dance music and the classic jazz age and influencing how later revivalist bands approached the city’s musical heritage.[1][7]

## Fun Facts
- The “Original Tuxedo” name comes from the Tuxedo Dance Hall in New Orleans, where the band was based from around 1910 until the venue closed in 1913, giving the orchestra a direct tie to one of the city’s early jazz hot spots.[7]
- A 1925 New Orleans session featuring “Original Tuxedo Rag” captures the band at a formative moment in recorded jazz history, with Papa Celestin leading on cornet in a classic small‑group ensemble setup.[3]
- On an April 13, 1926 recording date in New Orleans, the group’s lineup included a female pianist, Jeanette Salvant, which was relatively unusual and noteworthy in early jazz recording ensembles.[4]
- Decades after its early recordings, the Tuxedo name lived on: Oscar “Papa” Celestin was later documented in 1950s radio broadcasts with his Tuxedo Jazz Band, helping to keep traditional New Orleans jazz in the public ear during the jazz revival era.[1]
