## Biography
Famous Pluto (Osahon Grandeur Uzama, born August 14, 2006) and Zerrydl (Divine Uzama, born December 4, 2002) are Nigerian brothers from Benin City, Edo State, known for their contributions to afrobeats, amapiano, and afropluto styles. Raised alongside their older brother Shallipopi in a musically inclined family, they began sharing freestyles and covers on social media in 2015. Zerrydl, the eldest of the two, started rapping consistently from 2021, releasing his debut single 'Ifeoma' in 2022 and breaking through with 'Puff & Pass' in 2023, which charted on TurnTable Top 100. Famous Pluto was initially reluctant but was encouraged by Shallipopi, drawing inspiration from Wizkid; he gained traction via a viral TikTok feature on 'Feel D Mood' in 2024.[1][2][5]

Both signed with Plutomania Records, owned by Shallipopi—Zerrydl in 2023 for his EP *Danger Zee*, and Famous Pluto in 2025 for his single 'Na Scra' (topping TurnTable Charts) and EP *Uzama The 3rd*. Their music blends rap, singing, and afrobeats with viral TikTok appeal, achieving Spotify popularity of 63 in genres like amapiano and afro adura. Zerrydl marked a Billboard debut with 'Back to Back' in 2024, while Famous Pluto featured on remixes like '1 WORK'.[1][2]

As rising stars, the Uzama brothers represent sibling synergy in Nigeria's afrobeats scene, building on family support amid early struggles like funding studio sessions. Their quick ascents highlight TikTok's role in modern breakthroughs, with ongoing collaborative projects shaping their emerging legacy.[1][2][5]
