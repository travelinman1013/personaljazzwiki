## Biography
Dizzy Gillespie (1917-1993) was an American jazz trumpeter and bandleader who revolutionized jazz by becoming the first musician to introduce Latin influences into American jazz, fundamentally shaping the genre's evolution.[2][5] Born in Cheraw, South Carolina, Gillespie developed his innovative bebop style and became a legendary figure whose influence extended far beyond his lifetime. Arturo Sandoval, born November 6, 1949, in Artemisa, Cuba, emerged as one of Gillespie's most significant proteges and musical heirs.[1][2] While living in Cuba, Sandoval was profoundly influenced by Gillespie's groundbreaking fusion of Latin rhythms with American jazz, along with the styles of Charlie Parker and Clifford Brown.[1] The two musicians met in 1977 when Gillespie visited Cuba, and Gillespie became Sandoval's mentor and "spiritual father," guiding his artistic development and eventually helping him defect from Cuba in 1990 during a European tour.[1][3] Sandoval evolved into one of the world's most acknowledged guardians of jazz trumpet and flugelhorn, as well as a renowned classical artist, pianist, and composer, carrying forward Gillespie's legacy of Latin jazz innovation.[2][5] His 60-year career has included seven albums on Blue Note Records, 10 Grammy Awards, and induction into the Latin Songwriters Hall of Fame, cementing his status as a living legend in jazz history.[2][6]
