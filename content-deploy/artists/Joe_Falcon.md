## Biography
Joe Falcon (September 28, 1900 – November 19, 1965) was a pioneering Cajun accordionist from Roberts Cove, Louisiana, whose career helped define and popularize Cajun music. Born into a family of Acadian and Isleño descent, Falcon began playing the accordion at age seven, growing up in a rural environment where music was an integral part of community gatherings. His professional career started by chance at a local dance hall, the 'Blue Goose,' when he was asked to fill in for an absent band, launching a lifelong vocation in music.

Falcon's most significant contribution came in 1928, when he and his wife, guitarist and singer Cléoma Breaux, recorded 'Allons à Lafayette' in New Orleans. This was the first commercial Cajun record, and its success brought national attention to the genre, previously known only within Louisiana and Texas. The duo recorded further sessions in New York and Atlanta, becoming regional celebrities and inspiring a wave of Cajun recordings. After Cléoma's death in 1941, Falcon continued to perform with his Silver Bell String Band, adapting to changing tastes but remaining committed to the traditional Cajun sound. Despite declining to record further after the 1930s, disillusioned with the music industry, Falcon's influence endured, and he is remembered as a foundational figure in Cajun music history.
