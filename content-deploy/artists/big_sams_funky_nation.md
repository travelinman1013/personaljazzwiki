## Biography
Big Sam's Funky Nation is a high-energy funk band founded and fronted by trombonist Sammie "Big Sam" Williams, a New Orleans native whose musical roots run deep in the city's vibrant traditions. Williams, born and raised in New Orleans, honed his craft at the prestigious New Orleans Center for Creative Arts (NOCCA) and under the mentorship of saxophonist Kidd Jordan. He began his career as a teenager, founding the Stooges Brass Band and joining the legendary Dirty Dozen Brass Band, where he performed over 300 shows a year and collaborated with icons such as James Brown, Dave Matthews, and Karl Denson.[1][2][3][4][5]

In 2001, Williams launched Big Sam's Funky Nation, initially as a side project while still touring with Dirty Dozen. By 2007-2008, he dedicated himself fully to the band, assembling a stellar ensemble known for their electrifying live performances and genre-blending sound. The group fuses classic New Orleans brass with funk, jazz, rock, hip-hop, and even punk, creating what Williams calls his musical "gumbo." Their discography includes albums like "King of the Party," "Take Me Back," "Birth of A Nation," "Peace, Love & Understanding," and "Feet on the Floor."[1][2][3][4][5]

Big Sam's Funky Nation has become a staple of the New Orleans music scene and a fixture at major festivals such as Bonnaroo, the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, and South by Southwest. Williams' charisma and the band's technical prowess have earned them a devoted following and a reputation as one of the city's most dynamic live acts. Their legacy is intertwined with the ongoing evolution of New Orleans funk, carrying forward the city's traditions while pushing the boundaries of genre and performance.[3][4][5]
