## Biography
Michael Wolff, born July 31, 1952, in Victorville, California, and raised in New Orleans, is a renowned American jazz pianist, composer, and bandleader celebrated for his dynamic performances and innovative approach to jazz. His early exposure to music came from his father, who taught him blues piano before he began classical lessons at age eight. Wolff's upbringing in musically rich cities like New Orleans, Memphis, and Berkeley deeply influenced his stylistic development, blending blues, jazz, and classical traditions.

Wolff's professional career began in his late teens when he left music school to join Latin jazz legend Cal Tjader's band, marking his recording debut in the early 1970s. He quickly established himself as a sought-after pianist, recording and touring with jazz greats such as Cannonball Adderley, Sonny Rollins, Nancy Wilson, Tony Williams, and Wayne Shorter. Wolff gained national recognition as the bandleader and musical director for The Arsenio Hall Show (1989–94), where he performed with a wide array of prominent artists and became a familiar face to television audiences. He later led the jazz ensemble Impure Thoughts, known for its percussive, improvisational style, and co-founded the jazz-funk group Wolff & Clark Expedition.

Wolff's legacy extends beyond performance; he has composed for film and television, notably co-producing and scoring 'The Tic Code' (1998), and collaborated with his sons Nat and Alex Wolff on the Nickelodeon series 'The Naked Brothers Band.' Honored as a Steinway Artist and recipient of multiple awards, Wolff remains an influential figure in contemporary jazz, admired for his versatility, mentorship, and enduring contributions to the art form.
