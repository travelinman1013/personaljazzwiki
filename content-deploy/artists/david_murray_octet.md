# David Murray Octet

## Biography
David Murray Octet refers to the octet led by renowned tenor saxophonist and composer David Keith Murray (born February 19, 1955, in Oakland, California), a key figure in avant-garde and free jazz since arriving in New York City in 1975. Murray, influenced early by free jazz pioneers like Albert Ayler, Ornette Coleman, Archie Shepp, and Sonny Rollins, attended Pomona College where professor Stanley Crouch mentored him in music and journalism, leading to interviews with artists such as Cecil Taylor and Dewey Redman, whose advice prompted him to prioritize his saxophone career over academics. He dove into NYC's loft-jazz scene, forming connections that launched his prolific output of over 200 albums as a leader, blending gospel, free jazz, hard bop, R&B, and avant-garde elements with his signature circular breathing for extended improvisations.[1][2][4][6]

The Octet emerged around 1980 as Murray's practical big band solution after leading larger ensembles at venues like the Public Theater, allowing him to run the group dynamically from the stage; its debut album *Ming* (Black Saint, 1980) featured Henry Threadgill on alto sax, Olu Dara on trumpet, George Lewis on trombone, Lawrence 'Butch' Morris on cornet, Anthony Davis on piano, Wilber Morris on bass, and Steve McCall on drums, showcasing AACM-associated players reimagined as New York jazz musicians. Murray's career expanded through the World Saxophone Quartet (founded with Julius Hemphill, Oliver Lake, and Hamiet Bluiett), collaborations with Jack DeJohnette's Special Edition, and quartets with John Hicks, Reggie Workman, and Ed Blackwell, while later works included tributes like *Octet Plays Trane* (1999) and diverse projects with Saul Williams and Gregory Porter. His compositional style honors jazz traditions amid free flights, marked by memorable melodies and arrangements.[1][2][3][4][5]

Murray's legacy as one of the greatest tenor saxophonists of his generation endures through his vast discography, influence on subsequent players, and innovations like reviving the Clarinet Summit in 2015 with Don Byron, David Krakauer, and Hamiet Bluiett. Living in New York City, he continues performing and recording, bridging avant-garde roots with broad collaborations including McCoy Tyner, Randy Weston, and Jason Moran, cementing his role in jazz evolution.[2][3][4]

## Fun Facts
- David Murray uses circular breathing to produce astonishingly long phrases in his improvisations, a technique highlighted in his early loft-jazz work.
- He played a set with the Grateful Dead at Madison Square Garden on September 22, 1993, and released a critically acclaimed tribute album *Dark Star* in 1996.
- Murray interviewed jazz icons like Cecil Taylor and Ornette Coleman as part of a college independent study but dropped out after Dewey Redman's advice to 'put down the pencil and pick up your saxophone.'
- The David Murray Octet was formed in 1980 after Murray realized he couldn't sustain a larger Public Theater big band with pianist Jaki Byard, opting for a more manageable standing group.
