## Biography
Eddi Reader, born Sadenia Edna Reader on 28 August 1959 in Glasgow, Scotland, began her musical journey early, learning guitar at age ten and busking in Glasgow streets before moving to Irvine in her late teens. She started performing young, using music to connect with others through busking and local folk clubs, and worked as a backing vocalist for UK acts including post-punk band Gang of Four, the Eurythmics (singing with Annie Lennox), and the Waterboys.[1][2][3][4]

Reader achieved international success as lead vocalist of Fairground Attraction, whose 1988 number-one single 'Perfect' and debut album *First of a Million Kisses* defined late-1980s folk-pop hits. Her solo career spans diverse albums like *Mirmama*, *Eddi Reader*, *Simple Soul*, and *Songs of Robert Burns*, blending contemporary songwriting with Scottish folk traditions, earning critical acclaim for emotional authenticity across genres.[1][5]

Awarded an MBE in 2006 for services to singing and an Honorary Doctorate from the University of the West of Scotland in 2025, Reader's legacy lies in connecting Scottish musical heritage globally while inspiring generations through her versatile voice and commitment to music's connective power.[1][2]
