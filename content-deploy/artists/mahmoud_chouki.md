## Biography
Mahmoud “Mood” Chouki was born on May 15, 1984, in Kenitra, Morocco, where he emerged as a musical child prodigy, mastering the guitar and developing into an international guitarist, composer, artistic director, and multi-instrumentalist. Raised in Morocco, he honed his skills before venturing globally, eventually discovering New Orleans around 2016 after performing worldwide and being captivated by the city's vibrant Frenchmen Street jazz scene, where local musicians welcomed him despite his lack of English proficiency.[1][2][3]

In New Orleans, Chouki quickly integrated into the jazz community, blending his Moroccan roots with American jazz traditions. He released his full-length album “Caravan: From Marrakech to New Orleans” in 2024 via Gallatin Street Records, produced by Jamison Ross and featuring legends like Herlin Riley, Jason Marsalis, Dr. Michael White, and John Boutte; the album mixes jazz standards with his original compositions on guitar, oud, and banjo, described as a love letter to the city. His style fuses North African, Middle Eastern, Spanish, and New Orleans jazz elements, showcased in performances, commissions like the “Oud Concerto for New Orleans,” and soundtracks such as the 2021 Sundance-winning film “Ma Belle, Ma Beauty.” He serves as music curator for the New Orleans Museum of Art and performs regularly at venues like Snug Harbor.[1][2][5]

Chouki's accolades include OffBeat Magazine’s “Best Emerging Artist” in 2020, Gambit Weekly's “Best World Music Artist” in 2022, and a high-profile 2023 performance of “St. James Infirmary” with Jon Batiste at the Palais Elysee for the French president. Now a resident of New Orleans, he continues to bridge cultures through music, education, and events like collaborations with Cuban artist Yusa, solidifying his role as an innovative force in world jazz.[1][2]
