## Biography
Hot 8 Brass Band is a renowned brass ensemble originating from New Orleans, Louisiana, formed in 1995 by Bennie Pete, who united members from two high school groups—the Looney Tunes Brass Band and the High Steppers Brass Band. The band quickly gained local acclaim by performing in Second Line parades, traditional jazz funerals, and on city streets, blending pop, soul covers, and original compositions into their repertoire. Their early musical style was heavily influenced by the legendary Dirty Dozen Brass Band and Rebirth Brass Band, which inspired their fusion of traditional New Orleans brass with contemporary genres like hip-hop and funk.

The band’s trajectory was deeply affected by the devastation of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, which disrupted their lives and career. Despite these hardships, Hot 8 Brass Band became a vital force in supporting and rallying the displaced New Orleans community through charity and musical outreach. Their debut album, 'Rock With The Hot 8,' showcased their versatility, featuring original tracks and covers such as Marvin Gaye’s 'Sexual Healing.' The latter gained international attention after being championed by producer Quantic, leading to a partnership with Tru Thoughts Records in the UK and expanding the band’s global reach.

Hot 8 Brass Band’s legacy is marked by resilience in the face of tragedy, including the loss of key members Joseph Williams and Dinerral Shavers to violence. Their music continues to honor these members, and their energetic performances have made them fixtures at festivals, on HBO’s 'Treme,' and in collaborations with artists like Lauryn Hill. Their style—characterized by powerful brass, riff-based tunes, and hip-hop elements—has helped redefine the sound of modern New Orleans brass bands.
