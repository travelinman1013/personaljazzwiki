## Biography
“Florito, Neyna & Sandro Beatz” is a collaborative credit bringing together Angolan Afro‑fusion vocalist **Florito**, Cape Verdean singer‑songwriter **Neyna**, and producer/beat‑maker **Sandro Beatz**, notably on the lounge‑leaning track “Kannot Compare.”[1][3][4][2] Rather than a permanent band, the name represents a studio collaboration that merges Lusophone African influences—especially from Angola and Cape Verde—with contemporary Afro‑beat, Afro‑fusion, and smooth, laid‑back production aesthetics suited to lounge and chill playlists.[3][4][5][2]

Florito, born **Florisberto Mbemba** in **Luanda, Angola**, is described as an Afro‑fusion singer and songwriter whose work blends melodic vocals with modern Afrobeats and Afro‑beat grooves.[4][5] Neyna, a **Cape Verdean singer‑songwriter**, has been active since the early 2000s and is known for soulful vocals and danceable rhythms that draw on Cape Verdean traditions while embracing contemporary Lusophone pop and urban sounds.[2] In “Kannot Compare” and similar collaborations, their voices are framed by Sandro Beatz’s production, which emphasizes smooth rhythmic patterns, soft synth textures, and lounge‑friendly sound design, positioning the project within a crossover space between Afro‑fusion and lounge music for international streaming audiences.[1][3][4][2]

Although the project’s long‑term legacy is still emerging, this collaboration is part of a broader movement in Lusophone Africa and the diaspora where artists from Angola and Cape Verde work across borders, languages, and styles to create accessible, streaming‑oriented tracks that circulate on digital platforms and curated playlists.[2][4][5] By combining Florito’s Angolan Afro‑fusion, Neyna’s Cape Verdean songwriting, and Sandro Beatz’s contemporary production approach, “Florito, Neyna & Sandro Beatz” highlights the growing global visibility of Lusophone African artists in lounge and Afro‑beat/afro‑fusion circles.[2][4][5]

## Fun Facts

- Neyna has been active since the early 2000s as a Cape Verdean singer-songwriter, so her collaboration on “Kannot Compare” reflects a meeting of a long-established Lusophone artist with newer Afro-fusion sounds.[2]
