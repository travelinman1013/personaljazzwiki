## Biography
Marvin Monnie Sease (February 16, 1946 – February 8, 2011) was an American blues and soul singer-songwriter known for his gospel-drenched vocals, explicit lyrics, and deep roots in the Southern chitlin’ circuit.[1][2] He was born in the small farming town of Blackville, Barnwell County, South Carolina, and grew up in a large family of thirteen children.[1][4] As a teenager he gravitated toward church music, singing in a Charleston-based gospel group called the Five Gospel Crowns (also referred to as the Five Gospel Singers), before moving at around age 20 to New York City, where he joined another gospel outfit, the Gospel Crowns.[1][2][4] Although he was firmly grounded in gospel traditions, Sease preferred secular R&B and soul, and eventually left the gospel circuit to form his own R&B group with his brothers, performing around Brooklyn and New York clubs.[1][2]

After his early band efforts failed to break through, Sease began working clubs and dances largely on his own, often singing to pre-recorded backing tracks and gradually building a local following, notably through a regular gig at the Brooklyn nightclub Casablanca.[1][2] In the mid‑1980s he self-produced the album *Ghetto Man* on his Early label, which attracted label attention as he worked the Southern club and juke-joint circuit.[1][2] PolyGram’s London/Mercury imprint re-released the material nationally in 1987 as the album *Marvin Sease*, adding the ten‑minute track “Candy Licker,” whose explicit, innuendo-heavy lyrics—though largely unplayable on radio—turned him into a cult star across the Deep South.[1][2] He went on to record a string of albums for Mercury and Jive, including *Breakfast* (1988), *The Real Deal* (1989), *Show Me What You Got* (1991), *The Housekeeper* (1993), and *Do You Need a Licker?* (1994), scoring his lone national chart entry with “Tonight,” which reached No. 86 on the U.S. Billboard R&B chart in 1991.[1] Later in his career he signed with Malaco Records, releasing *Playa Haters* (2004), the live CD/DVD *Grown & Sexy: Live with the Candy Licker* (often cited as *Grown Up “Live with the Candy Licker”*, 2005), and *Who’s Got the Power* (2008), while remaining a major live draw on the Southern soul-blues circuit until his death in Vicksburg, Mississippi, in 2011.[1][2][3]

Musically, Sease occupied a stylistic space between Southern soul and contemporary blues, drawing heavily on gospel phrasing and testifying while embracing the adult-themed, sometimes X‑rated storytelling associated with modern juke-joint blues.[1][2][5] Critics and biographers frequently compare his style to that of Johnnie Taylor and Tyrone Davis—soulful baritones who blended blues, church-inflected vocals, and secular narratives—although Sease never matched their mainstream chart success, instead cultivating a loyal, largely female fan base through word of mouth, touring, and jukebox play rather than radio or media exposure.[1][2][5] His signature song “Candy Licker” became both his calling card and his commercial limitation, typecasting him as an explicit, ladies’-man performer, yet he also recorded and performed straight soul ballads and blues numbers that showcased a more serious, emotionally nuanced side of his artistry.[2][3] Within the Southern soul and contemporary blues community he is remembered as one of the genre’s most distinctive voices of the late 20th century, maintaining a durable cottage industry of records, live shows, and merchandise long after mainstream coverage had largely overlooked him.[2][3][5]

## Fun Facts
- Sease built much of his career without mainstream radio play; his breakthrough hit “Candy Licker” was considered too explicit for airplay, yet it became a jukebox and live-show phenomenon across the Deep South.[1][2]
- Before he could afford a full band, Sease often performed alone in clubs, singing to pre-recorded backing tracks while gradually developing his highly theatrical, adult-themed stage act.[2][3]
- His 1987 album *Marvin Sease* reached No. 14 on Billboard’s R&B albums chart and No. 114 on the pop chart, making it his most commercially successful release despite its lack of traditional media support.[2]
- In interviews he emphasized that his overtly sexual material was only one facet of his work, pointing to earlier and lesser-known ballads as evidence of his roots in deep, serious Southern soul.[3][4]
