## Biography
Michael Samuel Kiwanuka, born on 3 May 1987 in Muswell Hill, North London, to Ugandan immigrant parents who fled Idi Amin's regime, grew up discovering music through influences like Radiohead, Nirvana, Jimi Hendrix, and soul legends such as Marvin Gaye, Otis Redding, Bill Withers, and Curtis Mayfield[1][2][4][6][7]. Initially plagued by self-confidence issues, he studied arts at the University of Westminster and worked as a session guitarist for artists like Chipmunk and Bashy, performing his first solo gig at age 22 at The Oxford in Kentish Town[1][2][3][4]. Discovered by Paul Butler, he signed with Communion Records, releasing EPs *Tell Me a Tale* (2011) and *I'm Getting Ready*, before inking a deal with Polydor Records and winning BBC's Sound of 2012[1][2][3][4].

Kiwanuka's debut album *Home Again* (2012) achieved gold status in the UK, peaking at number 4, followed by the critically acclaimed *Love & Hate* (2016, produced by Danger Mouse), which topped the UK charts and featured the HBO series *Big Little Lies* theme 'Cold Little Heart'[1][3][4][5]. His self-titled album *Kiwanuka* (2019, co-produced with Inflo) won the Mercury Prize in 2020 and earned Grammy and Brit nominations, while *Small Changes* arrived in 2024[4][5]. His style blends soul, folk, R&B, and emotional lyricism, often compared to classic soul icons, establishing him as a leading contemporary voice with Ugandan heritage shaping his introspective themes[1][2][4][5][6]. Open about anxiety struggles, he married musician Charlotte in 2016 and resides in Southampton[4].
