## Biography
John Lurie, born December 14, 1952, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, is a multifaceted artist whose career spans music, film, television, and painting.  Raised in New Orleans and Worcester, Massachusetts, with a Welsh artist mother and a father of Russian Jewish and Sicilian heritage, Lurie's early life was marked by musical exploration.  In high school, he played basketball and harmonica, even jamming with Mississippi Fred McDowell and Canned Heat in 1968.  He later transitioned to guitar and saxophone, eventually hitchhiking across the United States to Berkeley, California, before settling in New York City in 1974.  A brief London visit included his first saxophone solo at the Acme Gallery.

Lurie's career highlights include co-founding the influential Lounge Lizards jazz ensemble in 1978 with his brother Evan Lurie.  The band, featuring a rotating cast of notable musicians including Arto Lindsay, Marc Ribot, and John Medeski,  existed for 20 years.  He also acted in numerous films, notably Jim Jarmusch's *Stranger than Paradise* and *Down by Law*, and composed scores for over 20 films, including *Get Shorty*, which earned him a Grammy nomination in 1996.  His work extended to television, with the creation and starring role in the cult classic *Fishing with John*, and later, the HBO series *Painting with John*.  He also released the critically acclaimed album *The Legendary Marvin Pontiac: Greatest Hits* in 1999, a fictional project that garnered praise from David Bowie, Iggy Pop, and others.  In 2017, he released *Marvin Pontiac: The Asylum Tapes*.  He formed the John Lurie National Orchestra, releasing *Men With Sticks* (1993) and *The Invention of Animals* (2014).  He also composed the theme music for *Late Night with Conan O'Brien* with Howard Shore.

Lurie's musical style, initially described as "fake jazz" within the No Wave scene, evolved into increasingly sophisticated compositions.  His work with the Lounge Lizards and the National Orchestra showcased both tightly arranged pieces and heavily improvised music.  His saxophone playing has been praised for its emotional immediacy and inventive fluidity.  While his health challenges since 2000, attributed to chronic Lyme disease, have limited his musical output, his legacy as a composer, performer, and bandleader remains significant.  His impact extends beyond music, encompassing his contributions to film, television, and visual art, where his paintings have been exhibited internationally and acquired by the Museum of Modern Art.  His 2021 memoir, *The History of Bones*, further contributes to his lasting cultural presence.
