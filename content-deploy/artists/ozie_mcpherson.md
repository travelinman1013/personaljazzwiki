## Biography
Eliza Brown (1903–1983) was an American classic blues singer and recording artist who performed under multiple stage names throughout her career, including Ozie McPherson and Ozie Ware. Active primarily during the 1920s and late 1920s, Brown established herself as a blues vocalist during the classic blues era, recording under her birth name as well as her professional aliases. Her career gained particular prominence when she transitioned into jazz collaborations in the late 1920s, most notably with Duke Ellington's orchestra. Brown's musical versatility allowed her to navigate both the blues and jazz idioms, though her recording activities after 1929 remain largely undocumented, suggesting her career may have declined or shifted into less-recorded venues during the 1930s and beyond.

## Fun Facts
- Ozie Ware performed a particularly unusual vocal interpretation on 'Bandanna Babies,' showcasing her willingness to experiment with unconventional vocal approaches.
- She recorded a wordless version of 'The Mooche' with Duke Ellington's orchestra, contributing to the early exploration of wordless vocals in jazz recording.
- Brown used at least three different professional names during her recording career (Eliza Brown, Ozie McPherson, and Ozie Ware) between 1925-1929, reflecting common practices among blues and jazz artists of the era.
- Despite her collaborations with Duke Ellington and the quality of her recordings, Ellington never hired her as a regular singer for his orchestra, a decision that music historians have noted as a missed opportunity.
