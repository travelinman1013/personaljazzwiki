## Biography
Kemp Harris is a multifaceted American artist—singer, songwriter, pianist, actor, activist, author, and award-winning educator—whose work defies easy categorization, blending blues, folk, jazz, soul, and roots music into a distinctive, genre-fluid sound[1][2][4]. Born in segregated Edenton, North Carolina, Harris grew up immersed in gospel music, learning piano at age 14 and writing his first songs as a teenager[1][3]. After relocating to Massachusetts, he honed his craft in the vibrant Cambridge coffeehouse scene, developing a powerful, intimate performance style that has drawn comparisons to Bill Withers, Marvin Gaye, and Gil Scott-Heron[1][4]. Over a career spanning more than four decades, Harris has performed across the U.S. and Europe, composed for the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater and Complexions Contemporary Ballet, and maintained a parallel career as a public school teacher, educating young students for over 40 years[1][3][5]. His music is deeply personal and socially conscious, reflecting his experiences as a Black, gay man navigating America’s complexities—from the pain of segregation to the hope of the civil rights movement and beyond[1][2]. Albums like *Edenton* and *Live at The Bird SF* showcase his ability to fuse the personal and political, the sacred and profane, with clarity, compassion, and soul[1][4]. Harris’s legacy is that of a Renaissance man whose art is rooted in storytelling, human connection, and a relentless pursuit of truth[1][2].

## Fun Facts
- Harris taught himself piano at age 14 and began writing songs shortly after, recording them in college using a pair of old cassette players to layer parts[1][3].
- He performed his first public gig at a Cambridge coffeehouse called Reflections on Mt. Auburn Street and later sat in with blues legend Koko Taylor at Joe’s Place[3].
- Harris’s album *Edenton* is a bittersweet tribute to his segregated hometown, blending personal history with broader social themes[1][5].
- Despite his deep roots in American music, Harris cites Steely Dan’s *Aja*, Joni Mitchell’s *Blue*, and Stevie Wonder’s *Songs in the Key of Life* among his desert island records[3].
