## Biography
Solána Imani Rowe, professionally known as SZA, was born on November 8, 1989, in St. Louis, Missouri, and raised in Maplewood, New Jersey.[1][6] Her stage name derives from the Supreme Alphabet of Islam, where S represents 'sovereign' or 'savior', Z means 'zig-zag', and A stands for 'Allah'.[5] Growing up in a multicultural household with a Muslim father (Abdul Mubarak-Rowe, a CNN video producer) and Christian mother (Audrey Rowe, an AT&T executive), SZA was exposed to diverse musical influences from an early age, including jazz legends like Miles Davis and John Coltrane through her father, and R&B through her mother.[1][6] Despite her musical talent, she initially pursued marine biology at Delaware State University but dropped out in her final semester to focus on her music career.[6] Her early life was marked by challenges, including experiencing Islamophobic bullying following the September 11 attacks, which led her to abandon her hijab during middle school.[5][6]

SZA's music career began in earnest in 2011 when she met members of Top Dawg Entertainment at a Kendrick Lamar concert where she was working for the clothing label 10Deep.[5][6] Her early self-released extended plays, See.SZA.Run (2012) and S (2013), caught the attention of TDE co-president Terrence 'Punch' Henderson, making her the first female artist to sign with the label.[7] She released her third EP, Z (2014), which reached the top-ten on the US Independent Albums chart.[7] Her breakthrough came with her debut studio album Ctrl (2017), a critically acclaimed project that earned five Grammy Award nominations in 2018 and established her as a major force in contemporary R&B.[1][6] Her musical style seamlessly blends rhythm and blues, hip-hop, and soul, characterized by diaristic lyrics exploring themes of heartbreak, sexuality, and self-image.[1][6]

SZA has become one of the most important artists in modern R&B and played a significant role in popularizing alternative R&B.[4] Her artistry reflects a sophisticated understanding of genre-blending and emotional vulnerability, drawing from her diverse musical upbringing and personal experiences. With a Spotify popularity rating of 89, she continues to influence contemporary music and remains a prominent figure in the industry.
