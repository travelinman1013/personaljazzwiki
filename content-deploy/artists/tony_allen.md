## Biography
Tony Oladipo Allen was born in Lagos, Nigeria, in 1940 and is celebrated as one of the most influential drummers of the 20th century, best known for his foundational role in creating the Afrobeat genre. A self-taught musician, Allen began playing the drum kit at age eighteen while working as an engineer for a Nigerian radio station, absorbing a wide range of influences from traditional Yoruba music and Juju, to American jazz and the burgeoning highlife scene in West Africa[1][2][5].

Allen's career took a pivotal turn in the mid-1960s when he met Fela Kuti, with whom he formed the band Koola Lobitos, later evolving into Africa 70. As the drummer and musical director for Africa 70 from 1968 to 1979, Allen's polyrhythmic drumming became the heartbeat of Afrobeat, blending jazz, highlife, funk, and traditional African rhythms into a new, politically charged sound that resonated across continents[1][2][3][5]. After leaving Africa 70, Allen pursued a solo career, experimenting with dub, hip-hop, and electronic music, and eventually settled in Paris, where he continued to collaborate with a diverse array of international artists[2][3][5].

Allen's legacy is immense: he is credited by Fela Kuti himself as indispensable to the creation of Afrobeat, and his innovations have influenced generations of musicians worldwide. His autobiography, co-written with Michael E. Veal, documents his journey from Lagos to global stages, highlighting his role as both a cultural ambassador and a relentless musical innovator[1][3][5].
