## Biography
Jesse "Babyface" Thomas (February 3, 1911 – August 13, 1995) was an American Louisiana blues guitarist and singer born in Logansport, Louisiana, near the Texas border.[1][6] Known at different times as "Baby Face" or "Mule," and occasionally billed as "The Blues Troubadour," Thomas became a significant figure in blues music with a career spanning over six decades.[1] He is best known for his 1929 recording of "Blue Goose Blues" for Victor Records, which established him as a notable blues performer during the early era of recorded blues music.[1]

Throughout the 1940s and 1950s, Thomas recorded and performed extensively, establishing himself in the Los Angeles area where he operated his own Club record label.[1] He recorded for Specialty Records in 1953 and later returned to Shreveport, Louisiana in the late 1950s, where he continued his musical career by making recordings on his Red River label in the mid-1960s.[1] Despite the changing landscape of popular music, Thomas remained active as a performer well into his later years, appearing at the Long Beach Blues Festival in 1994 at the age of 83.[1] He passed away in Shreveport on August 13, 1995, leaving behind a legacy as a pioneering Louisiana blues musician whose influence extended across nearly a century of American blues music.[1]
