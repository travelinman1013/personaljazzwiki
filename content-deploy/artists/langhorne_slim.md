## Biography
Langhorne Slim is the stage name of American singer‑songwriter **Sean Scolnick**, born August 20, 1980, in Langhorne, Pennsylvania, from which he drew his moniker.[3][6][7] He attended Solebury School in nearby New Hope and later studied at the Conservatory of Music at SUNY Purchase, where he was admitted to the program despite not reading or writing music formally and gained early studio experience through blues tribute recording projects.[2][3][5] Rooted in anti‑folk, indie folk, and Americana, his songwriting blends raw emotional candor with ragged, high‑energy performances and a distinctive hoarse‑throated vocal delivery that various critics have described as roughhewn yet soulful.[1][3]

Slim began building a following in the early 2000s with releases such as *Electric Love Letter* (2004) and *When the Sun’s Gone Down* (2005), while touring extensively, including a notable stint with the Trachtenburg Family Slideshow Players and an appearance at Bonnaroo that helped raise his profile.[3] His song “Electric Love Letter” landed at number 5 on a Rolling Stone editor’s top‑ten list and appeared in the film *Waitress*, further expanding his audience.[3] Recording with his band (initially the War Eagles and later **Langhorne Slim & The Law**), he released a self‑titled album in 2008 and *Be Set Free* in 2009, supported by tours across the U.S. and Europe and slots at major festivals such as Newport Folk Festival, Lollapalooza, Bristol Rhythm & Roots Reunion, and the Philadelphia Folk Festival.[3] In 2012 he issued *The Way We Move*, recorded quickly at Old Soul Studio in Catskill, New York; the title track gained wide exposure through a Microsoft Windows 8 commercial, a film trailer for *Admission*, and the opening credits of *21 & Over*, while the album charted on multiple Billboard and independent charts.[3]

From the mid‑2010s onward, Slim solidified his reputation as a modern Americana voice unafraid to address personal transition and vulnerability. After settling in Nashville around 2014, he recorded *The Spirit Moves* (2015), his first album written and recorded completely sober, reflecting a period of major life changes and emphasizing themes of growth, honesty, and emotional recovery.[1] Subsequent releases, including *Live at Grimey’s* (2016), *Lost at Last Vol. 1* (2017), and *Strawberry Mansion* (2021), continued to showcase his intimate songwriting and spirited performances with The Law, whose members have included Malachi DeLorenzo (drums), Jeff Ratner (bass), Casey McAllister (keys, accordion), and Mat Davidson (guitar, banjo, violin).[1][3] Over more than two decades of recording and touring, he has earned praise from outlets such as Rolling Stone, Entertainment Weekly, The Washington Post, and Paste for delivering passionate, unvarnished songs that occupy a distinctive space between folk, rock, and roots traditions.[1][3]

## Fun Facts
- Langhorne Slim’s stage name combines his surname with his Pennsylvania hometown: he was born Sean Scolnick in Langhorne and adopted “Langhorne Slim” as an artistic moniker partly to honor that connection.[3][6][7]
- Despite graduating from the Conservatory of Music at SUNY Purchase, Slim has said he still does not read or write music, and entered the program thanks to a supportive professor who helped him navigate non‑traditional coursework.[2][3]
- His song “Electric Love Letter” not only made a Rolling Stone editor’s top‑ten list but also appeared in the film *Waitress*, giving an indie folk track unusual mainstream cinematic exposure.[3]
- The title track from *The Way We Move* gained wide recognition after being used in a Microsoft Windows 8 commercial, as well as in the trailer for the film *Admission* and over the opening credits of the comedy *21 & Over*.[3]
