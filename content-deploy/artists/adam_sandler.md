## Biography
Adam Sandler, born Adam Richard Sandler on September 9, 1966, in Brooklyn, New York, was raised in a Jewish family in New Hampshire and displayed comedic talent from a young age. Encouraged by his brother at 17, he performed his first stand-up at a Boston comedy club, later honing his skills while attending New York University. His early career included appearances on The Cosby Show in 1987 and MTV's Remote Control, followed by his film debut in Going Overboard (1989).[1][2][3][6]

Sandler's breakthrough came via Saturday Night Live (SNL), where comedian Dennis Miller recommended him to producer Lorne Michaels; hired as a writer in 1990, he became a cast member in 1991, creating iconic characters like Opera Man, Canteen Boy, and Cajun Man, alongside musical sketches such as 'The Chanukah Song' and 'Lunchlady Land.' Fired in 1995 amid low ratings, he transitioned to films like Billy Madison (1995) and Happy Gilmore (1996), while launching a music career with comedy albums starting with the Grammy-nominated They're All Gonna Laugh at You! (1993), featuring parody songs and sketches in a lowbrow, juvenile style that appealed to young audiences. His musical output includes eight albums like What the Hell Happened to Me? (1996) and Shhh... Don't Tell (2004).[1][2][3][5][6]

Sandler's legacy blends broad comedy films grossing over $2 billion, stand-up specials like 100% Fresh (2018), and musical parody, earning accolades including the 2023 Mark Twain Prize for American Humor, three Grammy nominations, and Emmy nods, cementing his influence in entertainment despite mixed critical reception for his humor.[2][3]
