## Biography
Jorge Abner Drexler Prada was born on September 21, 1964, in Montevideo, Uruguay, to a family with strong academic traditions. Before becoming a full-time musician, Drexler pursued medicine and became an otorhinolaryngologist (ENT specialist), completing his medical degree in 1992—the same year he released his debut album, La Luz Que Sabe Robar. He began his musical training at age five with piano lessons, later studying guitar and music composition alongside his medical studies. Despite his passion for music, Drexler initially followed his family's professional path, balancing his medical practice with early recordings that were released only in Uruguay.

Drexler's career trajectory shifted dramatically in 1995 when legendary Spanish singer-songwriter Joaquín Sabina invited him to Madrid, introducing him to the Spanish music scene and helping him secure an international recording contract. Impressed with Madrid's cultural environment, Drexler relocated to Spain permanently and recorded Vaivén (1996) with Spanish musicians, blending material from his earlier Uruguayan releases with new compositions. Over the following decade, he released four additional albums—Llueve (1998), Frontera (1999), Sea (2001), and Eco (2004)—establishing himself as a respected artist within the Latin American and Spanish music communities. His seventh album, Eco (2004), marked his mainstream breakthrough and featured the Oscar-winning song "Al Otro Lado Del Río," which was prominently featured in Walter Salles' film The Motorcycle Diaries (2004).

Drexler's 2005 Academy Award for Best Original Song made him the first Uruguayan to win an Oscar and marked the first time a Spanish-language song received this honor. Following this recognition, he continued releasing critically acclaimed albums including 12 Segundos de Oscuridad (2006), Cara B (2008), and Amar la Trama (2010). Throughout his career spanning more than three decades, Drexler has released 14 studio albums and received 13 Latin Grammy Awards, five ASCAP Latin Awards, and five Grammy Award nominations. His musical style blends trova, nueva trova, singer-songwriter traditions, and Latin folk elements, characterized by poetic lyricism and sophisticated arrangements. Although he has resided primarily in Spain since 1995, Drexler continues to partially record his albums in Uruguay with local musicians, maintaining strong connections to his homeland while establishing himself as a significant figure in contemporary Latin American music.

## Fun Facts
- Drexler began playing piano at age five and later took guitar and music composition classes, but initially pursued medicine to follow his family's professional path, becoming an otorhinolaryngologist before transitioning to full-time music at age 30.
- His first album release in 1992 was issued as a cassette tape with only 33 copies sold, as the record company in Uruguay deemed it 'too late for vinyl and too early for CD,' yet Drexler was very happy with this modest beginning.
- During his medical studies, Drexler took a break to hitchhike through Brazil, an experience that influenced his artistic development before he recorded his first two albums in Uruguay.
- In 2010, Drexler recorded his album Amar la Trama in just four days in a television studio in front of a small live audience selected through an online contest, deliberately choosing this format to avoid the 'coldness' of traditional recording studios and to capture a more playful, less melancholic atmosphere than his previous work.
