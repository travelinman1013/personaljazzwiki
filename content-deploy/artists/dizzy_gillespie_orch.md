## Biography
John Birks 'Dizzy' Gillespie was born on October 21, 1917, in Cheraw, South Carolina, the youngest of nine children. He began playing piano at age 4, trombone at 12, and trumpet at 14, learning to read music from a roommate at school before dropping out in 1935 and moving to Philadelphia with his family. There, he joined Frankie Fairfax's orchestra, earning his nickname 'Dizzy,' and soon progressed to bands led by Teddy Hill (1937, replacing Roy Eldridge), Cab Calloway (1939-1941), and Earl Hines (1942), where he first explored bebop ideas alongside Charlie Parker.[1][2][3][5]

Gillespie's career breakthrough came in 1945 with seminal bebop recordings like 'Salt Peanuts,' 'Groovin' High,' and 'Hot House' alongside Parker, marking a shift from swing with fast tempos, virtuosic improvisation, and complex harmonies. He formed influential big bands, including a groundbreaking 1946-1950 orchestra incorporating Afro-Cuban jazz via conga drummer Chano Pozo on hits like 'Manteca' and 'Cubana Be/Cubana Bop,' featuring future stars such as Milt Jackson, John Lewis, James Moody, and Quincy Jones. Economic pressures ended it, but he led State Department-sponsored tours (1956-1958) and later groups like the United Nation Orchestra until his death in 1993.[1][4][6]

Renowned for his puffed cheeks, angled trumpet bell, and innovative style blending bebop, Afro-Cuban rhythms, and big band swing, Gillespie's legacy as a co-founder of modern jazz endures through his virtuosity, compositions, global ambassadorship, and mentorship of generations of musicians.[1][2][4]

## Fun Facts
- Gillespie was fired from Cab Calloway’s band in 1941 after Calloway mistook him for throwing a spitball (actually Jonah Jones), following tensions over Dizzy’s experimental 'Chinese music' solos.[1]
- His iconic trumpet bell was bent upward in 1953 when dancer Sally Marr accidentally fell on it during a performance, creating his signature angled sound.[1]
- Gillespie led U.S. State Department-sponsored big band tours starting in 1956 as a jazz ambassador, performing across the Near East, Europe, and South America.[1][2]
- He composed over 500 tunes, including bebop standards like 'A Night in Tunisia' and 'Salt Peanuts,' and remained active teaching until weeks before his death in 1993.[1]
