## Biography
Blind Willie Johnson (January 25, 1897 – September 18, 1945) was an American gospel blues singer and guitarist born near Pendleton, Texas, who became one of the most influential religious musicians of the early recording era. Blinded as a child, reportedly by his stepmother during a domestic dispute, Johnson taught himself guitar with a cigar box instrument his father constructed for him. He based much of his musical foundation on hymns learned in churches around Marlin and Hearne, Texas, where he performed at Baptist Association meetings and revivals, earning tips in a tin cup tied to his guitar. His aspirations to become a preacher were realized when he became a Baptist preacher in 1927, the same year he married Angeline, who significantly influenced his repertoire by teaching him songs from old songbooks she preserved.

Johnson's recording career, though brief, was remarkably prolific and influential. Between December 3, 1927, and April 20, 1930, he completed thirty recordings across five sessions for Columbia Records at locations in Dallas, New Orleans, and Atlanta. His landmark recordings showcased a distinctive combination of powerful chest voice singing delivered in a rasping false bass, virtuosic slide guitar technique (bottleneck guitar), and original compositions that seamlessly blended religious themes with blues sensibilities. Columbia Records advertised his music as "nothing like anything else," and he became one of the most popular Black recording artists of the era until the Great Depression devastated the record industry and his audience. His performances were so forceful that legend claims he was once arrested for inciting a riot while singing "If I Had My Way I'd Tear This Building Down" in front of the New Orleans Customs House.

Despite his musical significance, Johnson remained impoverished throughout his life. After the Depression ended his recording career, he continued performing as a street singer and evangelist in Texas cities including Beaumont, where he operated the House of Prayer. In 1945, a fire destroyed his home, and Johnson continued living in its ruins in deteriorating conditions until his death on September 18, 1945. His legacy proved enduring: his composition "Dark Was the Night (Cold was the Ground)" was selected for inclusion on the Voyager 1 spacecraft in 1977 as a representative sample of Earth's music for potential extraterrestrial audiences. His influence on subsequent generations of blues and gospel musicians, particularly Texas bluesmen, remains profound and widely recognized by music historians.

## Fun Facts
- Johnson's composition 'Dark Was the Night (Cold was the Ground)' was selected for the Voyager 1 spacecraft in 1977, making it one of the few blues recordings to leave Earth's solar system as a representative sample of human music for potential extraterrestrial contact.
- According to legend, Johnson was once arrested for inciting a riot simply by standing in front of the New Orleans Customs House singing 'If I Had My Way I'd Tear This Building Down,' a chant-and-response number that generated such powerful audience enthusiasm it drew law enforcement attention.
- Johnson's wife Angeline played a crucial role in his musical development, teaching him many of his famous songs from old songbooks she kept in a trunk in the back of their house after they married in 1927.
- Despite recording only thirty songs over three years (1927-1930) and achieving significant popularity during the early recording era, Johnson remained poor throughout his life, and the Great Depression so devastated his audience that only 800 copies were pressed of his final recording session in 1930.
