## Biography
Few Blue is a four-piece rock band formed in 2021 by a group of New Orleans natives while attending Louisiana State University (LSU) in Baton Rouge. The members—Cam Wiz (vocals), Brad Boozer (guitar), Christian Liang (bass), and Rob Schexnayder (drums)—initially bonded over their shared love of music and began performing together at local bars and venues, gradually building a reputation for their energetic live shows. Their early days were marked by grassroots hustle, playing small gigs and learning the ropes through trial and error, with each member contributing their unique strengths to the band's development.

After gaining traction in Baton Rouge, Few Blue returned to their hometown of New Orleans, where they landed their first major show at the iconic Rock N Bowl. Their blend of original material and classic covers quickly won over audiences, earning them regular headlining slots and a growing fanbase. The band is dedicated to reviving the sounds of the '70s, '80s, and '90s, drawing inspiration from legendary acts such as The Eagles, The Beatles, Fleetwood Mac, Tom Petty, Boston, and Led Zeppelin. Their debut EP, 'Oops,' produced by multi-platinum producer Jack Miele, showcases their nostalgic yet fresh approach to rock music.

Few Blue is recognized for their dynamic performances, particularly the commanding stage presence of lead singer Cam Wiz. The band has been featured on morning news shows and radio stations, and is slated to perform at the 2024 Cutting Edge Music Conference. Through a combination of classic influences, modern energy, and a commitment to original songwriting, Few Blue is carving out a distinctive place in the contemporary New Orleans music scene.
