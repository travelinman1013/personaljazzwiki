## Biography
Leroy Lloyd was a pioneering R&B and blues instrumentalist from South Carolina who established himself as a significant figure in the Southern music scene during the 1950s through 1970s.[4] He fronted his own popular band, The Swinging Dukes (also known as The Swingin' Dukes), which became an integral part of Augusta, Georgia's musical heritage.[2][3] Lloyd's career was marked by his work as a talented horn player and bandleader, and he toured extensively across the southern United States, performing with major artists including James Brown and Jackie Wilson.[2] Beyond his musical pursuits, Lloyd later became a businessman, serving as the former owner of New Image Paint and Body Shop in Augusta.[7] The Swinging Dukes maintained a long and active career, with various singers and band members rotating through the ensemble over the decades, and the group continued performing into the 1990s.[5] Lloyd's contributions to R&B and blues music made him an essential figure in Augusta's cultural landscape, with historians noting that it is nearly impossible to discuss the city's musical past without acknowledging his influence.[3]
