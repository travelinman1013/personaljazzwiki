## Biography
Mike Dillon, born in San Antonio, Texas, is a celebrated American percussionist, vibraphonist, bandleader, and vocalist whose career has spanned several decades and genres. His early musical inspiration came from the progressive rock band Rush, which led him to pursue percussion as a teenager. Dillon began performing in the 1980s with Dallas-area favorites Ten Hands and soon became a fixture in the Texas music scene, leading bands such as Billy Goat and Hairy Apes BMX (HABMX), and later joining experimental groups like Malachy Papers, Critters Buggin, and Garage A Trois[1][2][3].

Dillon's musical style is a fusion of punk, jazz, funk, and experimental rock, drawing on influences from jazz legends like Lionel Hampton and Milt Jackson as well as punk icons such as Bad Brains and The Minutemen[3][4]. His virtuosic approach to the vibraphone and percussion has made him a sought-after collaborator, working with artists including Les Claypool (Primus, Frog Brigade), Ani DiFranco, Rickie Lee Jones, Galactic, and the Dean Ween Group[1][4]. Dillon is known for his relentless touring schedule and his ability to blend genres into a unique, intense, and groovy sound described as 'punk-jazz hybrid.'

Throughout his career, Dillon has formed and led several bands, most notably Mike Dillon's Go-Go Jungle and Punkadelick, and contributed significantly to Garage A Trois' compositions. His legacy is marked by his innovative spirit, genre-defying performances, and his role in shaping the modern fusion of jazz, punk, and funk. Dillon currently resides in Kansas City and New Orleans, continuing to record, tour, and inspire new generations of musicians[1][5].
