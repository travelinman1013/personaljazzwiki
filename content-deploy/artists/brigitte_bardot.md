## Biography
Brigitte Bardot was born on September 28, 1934, in Paris, France, into a bourgeois family; her father was an engineer, and her mother encouraged her early interest in music and dance, leading her to study ballet at the National Superior Conservatory of Paris for Music and Dance. By age 15, she appeared on the cover of Elle magazine, launching her modeling career, and soon transitioned to film, debuting in 1952's Le Trou Normand after marrying director Roger Vadim that same year.[1][2] Her breakthrough came with the 1956 film And God Created Woman, directed by Vadim, which established her as an international sex symbol, breaking taboos on nudity and setting box office records.[1][4]

Bardot starred in around 50 films through the 1960s, including Contempt (1963), Viva Maria! (1965) with Jeanne Moreau, and others like The Night Heaven Fell (1958), embodying a post-war hedonistic ethos in French cinema.[1][3][4] Musically, she released albums such as Brigitte Bardot Sings (1960) and Special Bardot (1968), recording approximately 60 pop songs in genres like French jazz, pop, chanson, and variété française, often in collaboration with Serge Gainsbourg; her style blended lounge and playful sensuality reflective of her film persona.[1] She retired from acting in 1973, settling in Saint-Tropez, and shifted focus to animal rights, founding the Brigitte Bardot Foundation in the mid-1980s, which influenced bans on seal fur and ivory imports.[1]

Bardot's legacy as a cultural icon of sensuality and liberation endures, though marked by personal struggles like a 1960 suicide attempt amid fame's pressures; she passed away on December 28, 2025, at age 91 in Saint-Tropez.[1][3]
