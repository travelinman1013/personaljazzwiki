## Biography
Sarah Lois Vaughan, known as 'Sassy' or 'The Divine One,' was born on March 27, 1924, in Newark, New Jersey, to amateur musicians—her father played guitar and her mother sang in the church choir[3]. Vaughan began piano and organ lessons at age seven and sang as a soloist at Mount Zion Baptist Church, where her musical foundation was built[1][3]. Her professional breakthrough came in 1942 when she won an amateur contest at Harlem’s Apollo Theater with her rendition of 'Body and Soul,' leading to her recruitment by bandleader Earl Hines as a singer and second pianist[1][2][3]. A year later, she joined Billy Eckstine’s band, where she met bebop pioneers Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker, who profoundly influenced her vocal style—Vaughan often sought to emulate the phrasing and improvisational techniques of jazz horn players[1][3][4].

After leaving Eckstine’s band, Vaughan briefly performed with John Kirby before establishing herself as a solo artist, blending jazz with pop and achieving mainstream success with hits like 'Broken-Hearted Melody,' 'Misty,' and 'Send in the Clowns'[2][3]. Her contralto voice spanned three octaves, and her virtuosic improvisations set a new standard for jazz singing[3]. Vaughan recorded for major labels such as Columbia, Mercury, and Roulette, and toured internationally, often accompanied by a trio[1][3]. She won a Grammy Award in 1982 for 'Gershwin Live!' and was inducted into the Jazz Hall of Fame in 1990, the year of her death[3]. Vaughan’s legacy endures as one of the greatest jazz vocalists, influencing countless artists across genres[1][3].
