## Biography
Diego El Cigala, born Ramón Jiménez Salazar on December 27, 1968, in Madrid, Spain, is one of the most celebrated flamenco singers of his generation. Raised in the vibrant El Rastro district, he grew up surrounded by flamenco culture, with a family lineage steeped in the tradition—his father, José de Córdoba, was a noted Andalusian singer, and his uncle was the legendary Rafael Farina. El Cigala’s prodigious talent emerged early; by age twelve, he had already won local flamenco competitions and gained recognition on Spanish television.[1][2][3][6][7]

El Cigala began his career accompanying renowned flamenco dancers and collaborating with top guitarists such as Tomatito and Vicente Amigo. In 1997, he launched his solo career with the album 'Undebel,' followed by a series of acclaimed recordings that blended traditional flamenco with Latin jazz, bolero, tango, and son cubano. His groundbreaking 2003 album 'Lágrimas Negras,' a collaboration with Cuban pianist Bebo Valdés, fused flamenco with Cuban rhythms and achieved international acclaim, earning multiple Grammy awards and double platinum sales. El Cigala continued to explore cross-genre collaborations, working with jazz musicians and venturing into tango and salsa, while always maintaining flamenco as the core of his expressive, passionate vocal style.[1][2][3][4][5]

Regarded as a transformative figure in world music, El Cigala’s legacy lies in his ability to honor flamenco’s roots while expanding its boundaries. His voice—raw, emotional, and unmistakably flamenco—has brought the genre to new audiences worldwide. With a career spanning over two decades, multiple Latin Grammy wins, and a reputation for innovative collaborations, Diego El Cigala remains a vital and influential ambassador of Spanish and Latin music.[1][2][3][4][9]
