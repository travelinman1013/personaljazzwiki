## Biography
Chris Smither, born William Christopher Smither on November 11, 1944, in Miami, Florida, and raised in New Orleans, is a renowned American singer-songwriter and guitarist whose music blends country blues, Americana, and folk. The son of Tulane University professors, Smither spent formative years in New Orleans, attended middle school in Paris, and college in Mexico City before moving to Boston in the mid-1960s, where he became a fixture in the vibrant folk revival scene[2][4][6][9].

Smither began performing in Boston coffeehouses in 1966, quickly gaining recognition for his soulful songwriting and distinctive fingerstyle guitar technique, marked by driving rhythmic thumb and percussive foot-tapping[4][5]. His early works, including "Love You Like a Man" and "I Feel the Same," were notably covered by Bonnie Raitt, helping to launch both artists' careers[1][3][4]. Despite a period of professional difficulty in the 1970s, Smither persevered, reemerging in the 1990s as a respected figure in acoustic music, releasing acclaimed albums on Hightone Records and Signature Sounds, and earning awards such as the Boston Music Award and NAIRD[2][3].

Over a career spanning six decades and twenty albums, Smither has become an influential voice in American roots music, celebrated for his poetic lyrics, gravelly vocals, and masterful guitar work. His legacy is reflected not only in his own recordings but in the tributes and covers by other artists, as well as his role as a mentor and inspiration to new generations of musicians[3][5][8].
