## Biography
Charles Lloyd, born March 15, 1938, in Memphis, Tennessee, is a renowned American jazz saxophonist, flutist, and composer whose career has spanned over six decades. Growing up in Memphis, Lloyd was immersed in a vibrant musical environment, absorbing blues, gospel, and jazz influences from a young age. He began playing saxophone at nine and was mentored by pianist Phineas Newborn Jr., while forming close friendships with future jazz luminaries like trumpeter Booker Little. As a teenager, he played alongside blues legends such as Howlin’ Wolf and B.B. King, and with jazz peers including George Coleman and Harold Mabern.

Lloyd moved to Los Angeles in 1956 to study at the University of Southern California, where he became involved with the city’s dynamic jazz scene, performing with Ornette Coleman, Eric Dolphy, and others. He gained national attention as music director for Chico Hamilton’s group and later as a member of the Cannonball Adderley Sextet. In the mid-1960s, Lloyd formed his groundbreaking quartet with Keith Jarrett, Cecil McBee, and Jack DeJohnette. Their album 'Forest Flower: Live at Monterey' (1967) became a jazz best-seller and brought Lloyd international acclaim, with the group performing at major rock venues and festivals. Despite his success, Lloyd withdrew from the public eye in the 1970s, seeking spiritual renewal in Big Sur, before returning to recording and performance in the 1980s and 1990s, notably with ECM Records and later Blue Note, continuing to innovate and collaborate with new generations of musicians.

Lloyd’s music is marked by a lyrical, searching quality that blends jazz improvisation with elements of blues, rock, and world music. His legacy is defined by his adventurous spirit, genre-crossing collaborations, and influence on both jazz and popular music. He remains a vital figure in contemporary jazz, celebrated for his creativity and enduring impact.
