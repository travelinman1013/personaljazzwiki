## Biography
The Radiators, often referred to as The New Orleans Radiators, are a seminal American rock band formed in January 1978 in New Orleans, Louisiana. The original lineup—Ed Volker (keyboards, vocals), Dave Malone (guitar, vocals), Camile Baudoin (guitar), Reggie Scanlan (bass), and Frank Bua (drums)—came together after a marathon jam session in Volker’s garage, leading all five musicians to leave their previous bands and devote themselves to the new project. The group quickly became a fixture of the vibrant New Orleans music scene, blending swamp rock, R&B, funk, soul, and Cajun and Creole influences into a distinctive style they dubbed 'Fish Head Music.'

The Radiators built a devoted following through relentless touring and legendary live performances, becoming regular headliners at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival and earning a reputation for their eclectic setlists and improvisational prowess. Their dual-guitar sound drew comparisons to the Allman Brothers Band, and their songwriting—primarily driven by Volker—was both prolific and steeped in the traditions of New Orleans rhythm and blues. Over their 33-year career, the band released several albums, including 'Heat Generation' and 'Law of the Fish,' and achieved mainstream recognition with tracks like 'Doctor, Doctor.'

The band's legacy is deeply intertwined with the musical fabric of New Orleans, where they are celebrated for keeping the spirit of the city’s music alive during transitional decades. Their influence can be heard in the generations of local musicians who followed, and their genre-blending approach has left a lasting mark on the jam band and roots rock scenes.
