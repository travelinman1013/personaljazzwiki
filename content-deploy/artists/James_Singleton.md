## Biography
James Singleton is an acclaimed acoustic bassist, composer, and producer, born in Chicago in 1955. He began playing bass at an early age and briefly attended the University of North Texas before moving to New Orleans in 1976 to join legendary bluesman Clarence 'Gatemouth' Brown[2][6]. Immersed in the vibrant New Orleans scene, Singleton quickly established himself as one of the city's most sought-after bassists, performing with a wide array of jazz, blues, and experimental artists. His versatility and adventurous spirit led him to collaborate with icons such as Ellis Marsalis, James Booker, John Scofield, Chet Baker, and Natalie Cole, among many others[1][3][4].

Singleton is perhaps best known as a founding member of Astral Project, a modern jazz group he has played with since the late 1970s. The band is celebrated for its innovative approach, blending straight-ahead bop with the unique ambiance of New Orleans and embracing improvisation as 'composing in the groove'[1]. Singleton has also led several projects, including the James Singleton Orchestra and Trio, and participated in experimental ensembles featuring classical and electronic musicians[1][4]. His musical style is characterized by fearless improvisation, genre-blurring experimentation, and a deep commitment to keeping jazz radical and evolving[4].

Over four decades, Singleton's legacy has grown as a pillar of New Orleans music, both as a performer and as a mentor to younger musicians. He survived Hurricane Katrina, relocated briefly to Los Angeles, but ultimately returned to New Orleans, continuing to shape the city's musical landscape through his performances, recordings, and collaborations[1][4].
