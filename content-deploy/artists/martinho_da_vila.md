## Biography
Martinho da Vila, born Martinho José Ferreira on 12 February 1938 in Duas Barras, Rio de Janeiro state, is one of Brazil’s most important samba singers, composers, and writers.[1][3][6] He moved to Rio de Janeiro as a child, worked in various manual and technical jobs, and began frequenting local samba circles and samba schools, especially Aprendizes da Boca do Mato, where he started composing samba-enredo in 1958.[2][3] Closely linked to G.R.E.S. Unidos de Vila Isabel from 1965 onward, he adopted his stage name in homage to the school and quickly became known in the Rio carnival scene for his witty, socially aware lyrics and relaxed, conversational vocal delivery.[2][3]

His national breakthrough came at the III Festival da Record in 1967 with the song “Menina Moça,” followed by major success at the 1968 edition with “Casa de Bamba,” which opened the door to his self‑titled debut LP in 1969.[1][2][3] Throughout the 1970s and 1980s he released a string of influential albums, including “Canta, Canta Minha Gente” (1974), “Sentimentos” (1981), and “Festa da Raça” (1988), while also writing classic samba-enredos such as “Kizomba: A Festa da Raça,” which gave Vila Isabel the Rio Special Group championship in 1988.[1][2][3] Although widely identified with samba and pagode, Martinho’s work ranges across MPB and many Brazilian rhythms—ciranda, frevo, samba de roda, capoeira, bossa nova, calango and African-influenced sambas—often emphasizing Black Brazilian culture and Lusophone links, especially with Angola.[1][3]

Over a career spanning more than five decades, Martinho has released over 40 solo albums and hundreds of recorded songs, many covered by artists from different genres, making him one of Brazil’s best‑selling samba artists; his 1995 album “Tá Delícia, Tá Gostoso” was one of the first samba records to surpass one million copies sold.[1] He has received major honors such as the Shell Award for Brazilian Popular Music (1991), multiple Prêmio Sharp awards, the Latin Grammy for Best Samba/Pagode Album for “De Bem com a Vida” (2016), and a Latin Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award (2021), as well as civic decorations and an honorary doctorate from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro.[1][3] Beyond music, he is also a novelist, columnist, and cultural entrepreneur—creating a company group and publishing house—and he has bridged samba with classical music through projects like “Samba Classics” and the symphonic “Concerto Negro,” reinforcing his legacy as a central figure in Brazilian popular culture and Black cultural representation.[1][3]
