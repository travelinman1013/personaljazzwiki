## Biography
Inez Foxx (born Inez Rebecca Fox, September 9, 1937 – August 25, 2022) was an influential American rhythm and blues and soul singer, best known as one half of the sibling duo Inez and Charlie Foxx. Raised in Greensboro, North Carolina, Inez began singing with her older brother Charlie in their youth, initially performing gospel before transitioning to secular music. In 1960, Inez moved to New York City and recorded under her married name, Inez Johnston, but found little success until reuniting musically with Charlie.

Their breakthrough came in 1963 with the release of "Mockingbird," a reimagining of the lullaby "Hush, Little Baby." The song became a major hit, reaching the top 10 on both the US pop and R&B charts and selling over a million copies. The Foxx siblings became known for their energetic live performances and their role in the Northern soul movement, particularly with tracks like "Tightrope." While the duo struggled to replicate the massive success of "Mockingbird," they continued recording and touring through the late 1960s, with Inez also pursuing solo work into the 1970s.

Inez Foxx's musical style blended soulful vocals with pop sensibilities, and her work—both with her brother and as a solo artist—left a lasting mark on R&B. She was also notable for her songwriting, including collaborations with her then-husband Luther Dixon. Inez's legacy endures through the enduring popularity of "Mockingbird" and her influence on subsequent generations of soul and pop artists.
