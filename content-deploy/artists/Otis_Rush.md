## Biography
Otis Rush was born near Philadelphia, Mississippi, in 1934 (some sources cite 1935), the son of sharecroppers Julia Campbell Boyd and Otis C. Rush. Growing up in the segregated South during the Great Depression, Rush experienced poverty and hardship, often working in the cotton fields to help support his family. Music provided solace, and he sang in gospel choirs and taught himself harmonica and guitar, developing an unorthodox left-handed technique by playing the guitar upside-down. His early exposure to blues came from records at home and jukeboxes in town, and his first inspiration to pursue music professionally was sparked by witnessing Muddy Waters perform in Chicago[1][3][6].

Determined to escape farm life, Rush moved to Chicago at age 14, where he worked various jobs and immersed himself in the city's vibrant blues scene. By the mid-1950s, he had become a leading figure in the emerging West Side Chicago blues style, characterized by his slow-burning guitar sound, long bent notes, and powerful tenor voice. His first recording, "I Can't Quit You Baby" (1956), produced by Willie Dixon for Cobra Records, became a national R&B hit and established Rush's reputation for emotionally intense performances. Over the next decades, Rush continued to innovate, recording landmark singles and albums, and performing internationally, influencing both blues and rock musicians[1][2][3][5].

Rush's legacy is defined by his passionate singing, expressive guitar playing, and his role in shaping the West Side Chicago blues sound alongside contemporaries like Magic Sam and Buddy Guy. He was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1984, received a Grammy Award in 1998, and was ranked among Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Guitarists. His influence extended to artists such as Eric Clapton, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Michael Bloomfield, and Peter Green, ensuring his enduring impact on the blues and popular music[1][3][4].
