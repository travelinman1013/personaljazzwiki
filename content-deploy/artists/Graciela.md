## Biography
Graciela Beltrán, born December 29, 1974, in Los Angeles, California, is a celebrated Mexican-American singer renowned for her pivotal role in regional Mexican music. The youngest of six children in a family originally from Tamazula, Durango, Mexico, she grew up in Inglewood and Anaheim, California, where her musical journey began at the age of six, performing at local restaurants and parties. Despite facing personal tragedies in her youth, including the loss of close family members, Beltrán’s early exposure to music and her determination propelled her into the spotlight.

Her professional career took off in Los Angeles, where she recorded her first albums under the name Gracielita Beltrán, focusing on norteño, banda, and mariachi styles. By her early teens, she had caught the attention of EMI executives, leading to a recording contract and a string of successful albums, including the gold- and platinum-certified 'Baraja de Oro.' Her 1995 album 'Tesoro' established her as an international star, and she became a fixture on major Latin American television programs. Beltrán's collaboration with Selena on the album 'Las Reinas Del Pueblo' further cemented her legacy, with the album selling over 5 million copies worldwide. She has since released over 20 albums, many with Fonovisa and EMI Latin, and has been nominated for multiple Lo Nuestro Awards.

Beltrán’s musical style blends ranchera, banda, mariachi, and grupera, marked by a powerful voice and emotional delivery. She is credited with helping to shape the modern regional Mexican genre and breaking gender barriers in a traditionally male-dominated field. Known as 'La Reina del Pueblo' (The Queen of the People), her influence extends to both her contemporaries and a new generation of Latin artists.
