## Biography
Topsy Chapman (1947–2022) was a renowned jazz and gospel vocalist from Kentwood, Louisiana, whose prodigious musical talent was evident from the age of three. Raised in a family deeply rooted in gospel music—her father, Norwood, was a preacher and vocal music instructor—Chapman was performing in churches and earning money as a child. At 17, she moved to New Orleans, where she led her family gospel group, The Chapmans, and quickly became a fixture in the local music scene, performing at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival and local clubs.

Chapman's career reached new heights when she was recruited by playwright Vernel Bagneris for the original cast of the off-Broadway musical 'One Mo' Time,' a production that celebrated 1920s New Orleans black vaudeville. The show became an international sensation, with runs in New York, London, and across Europe, and its cast album earned a Grammy nomination. Chapman was celebrated for her powerful, gospel-tinged voice and her skillful vocal arrangements, both in the show and with her groups The Chapman Singers and later Topsy Chapman and Solid Harmony, which included her daughters Yolanda Robinson and Jolynda Phillips. She toured extensively worldwide, recorded with numerous jazz luminaries, and appeared in film and on radio, leaving a lasting legacy in New Orleans music and beyond.
