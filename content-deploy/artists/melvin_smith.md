## Biography
Melvin Smith is a versatile American saxophonist and composer, born and raised in Jacksonville, Florida. He began his musical journey at the age of twelve with the clarinet, but soon gravitated toward the tenor saxophone. By his teenage years, Smith was already performing at local venues, and his early exposure to a wide range of musical styles in Florida helped shape his eclectic approach. A pivotal moment came when his junior high jazz band performed at the Montreux Jazz Festival, solidifying his passion for jazz.

Smith's formal education began with a scholarship to the Berklee College of Music in Boston, where he studied under renowned musicians such as Andy McGhee, Billy Pierce, George Garzone, and Walter Beasley. He earned his Bachelor’s degree in Professional Music, followed by a Master’s in Jazz Studies from Queens College in New York, where he further honed his craft with jazz legends like Jimmy Heath and Sir Roland Hanna. Smith has since developed a unique musical style that fuses gospel, jazz, world beat, folk, and rock influences. He has released several solo projects, including 'Portrait' (2007), 'I Surrender All' (2008), 'Evidence' (2010), 'Time Will Tell' (2014), 'New Jack Theme' (2020), and 'Blessed' (2022), the latter featuring gospel classics.

Throughout his career, Smith has performed with and opened for notable artists such as Ce Ce Winans, Donnie McClurkin, Norman Connors, Michael Henderson, Charlie Persip, and Ben Vereen. His work as both a solo artist and collaborator has made him a respected figure in contemporary gospel jazz, known for his expressive saxophone playing and innovative compositions.
