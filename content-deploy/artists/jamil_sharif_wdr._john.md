His extensive education and heritage have positioned him as a versatile and respected figure in the New Orleans music scene.

As President of Umdah Music, Sharif has produced critically acclaimed albums, including 'Portraits of New Orleans,' which features Dr. John, and has collaborated with a wide range of musical luminaries. His repertoire encompasses jazz, blues, gospel, funk, pop, Latin, classical, and more, reflecting the rich musical traditions of New Orleans.
