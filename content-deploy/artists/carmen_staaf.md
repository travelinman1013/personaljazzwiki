## Biography
Carmen Staaf is an acclaimed pianist and composer recognized for her versatility and depth in jazz and improvised music. Born and raised in New York City, Staaf developed her musical foundation through twelve years of classical piano study before immersing herself in jazz and world music traditions. She earned dual degrees in Anthropology from Tufts University and Jazz Performance from the New England Conservatory, and quickly became one of the youngest faculty members ever hired by Berklee College of Music, joining their piano department in 2005[1][3][9].

Staaf's career has flourished through collaborations with many of the most influential figures in contemporary jazz. She has performed at major venues and festivals worldwide, including the Village Vanguard, Blue Note, SFJazz, Newport, Monterey, Montreux, and North Sea Jazz Festivals. Notably, she has played in a two-piano setting with Herbie Hancock and Wayne Shorter at the Playboy Jazz Festival, appeared with Wynton Marsalis and the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra, and performed solo alongside Kenny Barron and Fred Hersch at the Kennedy Center[1][3][5][6]. Staaf is currently the pianist and Musical Director for NEA Jazz Master Dee Dee Bridgewater, further cementing her reputation as a leading voice in jazz[1][3][5][6].

Her musical style is rooted in straight-ahead jazz but is enriched by influences from Afrocuban, Indian classical, West African, klezmer, and other world traditions. Staaf is also a dedicated educator, holding faculty positions at Berklee, the New School, Stanford Jazz Institute, Swarnabhoomi Academy of Music (India), Jacob’s Pillow, Litchfield Jazz Camp, and the New York Jazz Academy. She has won prestigious awards, including the 2009 Mary Lou Williams Jazz Pianist competition, and her compositions and arrangements have been performed by notable ensembles and artists, contributing to her legacy as both a performer and teacher[1][2][4][8].
