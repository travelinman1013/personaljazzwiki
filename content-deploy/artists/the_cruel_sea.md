## Biography
The Cruel Sea is an Australian indie rock band formed in late 1987 in Sydney, New South Wales. Initially an instrumental outfit drawing from surf music influences like The Ventures and The Shadows, the band evolved by incorporating country, soul, blues, funk, Latino, and reggae elements, creating a distinctive 'gumbo' sound led by Danny Rumour's unique guitar stylings.[1][2] Their debut album, Down Below, was released in 1989, featuring the instrumental track 'Reckless Eyeballin',' which became the theme for the Australian TV series Blue Heelers.[1][4]

The band's popularity surged in the 1990s after Tex Perkins (from Beasts of Bourbon) joined as vocalist in 1989, contributing to albums like The Honeymoon Is Over (1993), which went triple platinum and won five ARIA Music Awards in 1994, Three Legged Dog (1995), and Over Easy (1998).[1][2][6] Known for hits such as 'Better Get a Lawyer,' 'Takin' All Day,' and 'The Honeymoon Is Over,' they achieved commercial success with world tours and eight ARIA Awards total.[1] The group paused activities after keyboardist/guitarist James Cruickshank's death in 2015 from cancer treatment complications, leading to a hiatus.[2]

In recent years, The Cruel Sea reunited, welcoming Matt Walker (a former opening act) to replace Cruickshank, driven by anniversary reissues like the vinyl edition of The Honeymoon Is Over.[2][7] They released their first new album in 23 years, Straight Into The Sun, in March 2025, following tours supporting acts like Cold Chisel and performances at festivals.[1][7]

## Fun Facts
- Instrumental track 'Reckless Eyeballin'' from debut album Down Below became the theme song for long-running Australian TV police drama Blue Heelers.[1]
- Guitarist Danny Rumour lived so off-the-grid during the hiatus that bandmates had to track him down like 'Bigfoot' for the reunion.[7]
- The Honeymoon Is Over (1993) was reissued on vinyl for its 30th anniversary, sparking the band's full reunion after 10 years inactive.[1][2][7]
- Tex Perkins wore Hawaiian shirts during the 1993 ARIA Awards era, marking his 'Hawaiian shirt era.'[7]
