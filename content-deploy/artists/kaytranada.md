## Biography
Kaytranada, born Louis Kevin Celestin on August 25, 1992, in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, moved to Montreal, Canada, at a young age, where his musical journey began. Dropping out of high school at 15 to focus on music, he initially released tracks under the name Kaytradamus before adopting the moniker Kaytranada in 2012. His early work, consisting of remixes and original productions, quickly gained traction online, leading to a deal with XL Recordings in 2014. 

Kaytranada's debut album, '99.9%' (2016), showcased his signature blend of electronic, hip-hop, funk, soul, and R&B, earning him the Polaris Music Prize and a Juno Award. His follow-up, 'BUBBA' (2019), further cemented his reputation, winning the Grammy Award for Best Dance/Electronic Album and featuring collaborations with artists like Pharrell Williams, Kali Uchis, and Masego. Known for his instantly recognizable production style—marked by swinging rhythms and genre-blurring grooves—Kaytranada has become a sought-after producer, working with a wide range of artists and influencing the sound of modern dance and hip-hop music. 

Beyond his solo work, Kaytranada is one half of the hip-hop duo The Celestics with his brother Lou Phelps and has produced for icons such as Madonna, Alicia Keys, Snoop Dogg, and Mary J. Blige. His innovative approach and global touring, including supporting The Weeknd in 2023 and performing at major festivals like Coachella, have solidified his legacy as a transformative figure in contemporary music.
