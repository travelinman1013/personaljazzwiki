## Biography
Kiefer Shackelford, known professionally as Kiefer, was born in San Diego, California in 1992. He started playing piano as a toddler and was immersed in jazz from a young age by his father, who would drive him around town blasting jazz legends like John Coltrane. His mother taught him to read music, and during his teenage years, he began exploring beatmaking on Garageband while also seriously considering music as a career. He enrolled in UCLA's Jazz Studies Program, where he studied jazz piano under the direction of renowned jazz guitarist Kenny Burrell, receiving formal training in jazz while simultaneously discovering the Los Angeles beat scene.

While at UCLA, Kiefer's musical education expanded beyond traditional jazz when he attended Low End Theory, the influential Wednesday night beats show at The Airliner in Los Angeles's Lincoln Heights neighborhood. There, he witnessed artists like Mndsgn perform and became inspired to merge jazz with alternative hip-hop sounds. After graduating, he released his debut album "Kickinit Alone" in 2017 through Leaving Records, a Donuts-esque beat collage that showcased his ability to craft three-to-five-minute improvisations on piano and extract the most captivating moments. He soon signed with Stones Throw Records and released "Happysad" in 2018, followed by three EPs: "Bridges," "Superbloom," and "Between Days" (the latter made in collaboration with artist Mason London).

Kiefer's sound is an innovative fusion of Black American Music modalities including jazz, R&B, and hip-hop, combining hard-hitting beats with complex jazz voicings and sentimental melodies. His 2021 album "When There's Love Around" marked his first release featuring a full band, bringing new expressiveness to his music. In 2020, he won a Grammy for Best R&B Album for his production work on Anderson Paak's "Ventura." Beyond performing, Kiefer is dedicated to music education, regularly sharing his musical insights via Twitch, collaborating with followers on his channel, and designing teaching courses for platforms like Soundfly and Adidas. His ethos centers on feeling encouraged, empowered, and full of gratitude, with his music always pointing toward optimism and beauty.
