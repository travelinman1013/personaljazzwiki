## Biography
The Asylum Choir was an American rock duo formed in the late 1960s by keyboardist Leon Russell and guitarist Marc Benno, both of whom were prominent session musicians in California at the time[1][6]. The group was essentially a studio project, with Russell and Benno handling most of the instrumentation themselves, often using multi-track recording techniques to layer their performances[1]. Their debut album, Look Inside the Asylum Choir, was released in 1968, followed by a second album, Asylum Choir II, which was recorded in 1969 but not released until 1971 due to contractual disputes[1][2]. Despite the duo's brief existence, their work is noted for its creative arrangements and the distinctive blend of Russell’s piano-driven rock and Benno’s bluesy guitar work[1]. The Asylum Choir’s legacy is largely tied to the subsequent solo careers of its members, particularly Russell, who became a major figure in 1970s rock and pop[1]. Their music, though not widely recognized at the time, has since been appreciated by fans of psychedelic and roots rock for its experimental edge and musicianship.

## Fun Facts
- Leon Russell played most of the instruments on their albums, often recording parts separately and layering them via multi-track recording—a technique that was innovative for the time[1].
- The second Asylum Choir album was delayed for two years due to legal issues, by which time the duo had already disbanded; its eventual release benefited from Russell’s rising solo fame[1][2].
- Marc Benno went on to play guitar on The Doors’ album L.A. Woman, further cementing his reputation as a versatile session musician[1].
- The 1990 CD reissue of Asylum Choir II included most of the tracks from their first album as bonus material, making it a comprehensive collection of their work[2].
