## Biography
“Romy & Sampha” is not a permanent band or duo but a recurring collaboration between two established British artists: Romy Madley Croft (known as Romy, of The xx) and Sampha Lahai Sisay (known as Sampha). Both emerged from London’s innovative indie and electronic scenes in the late 2000s and 2010s, Romy as guitarist, vocalist and songwriter for the Mercury Prize‑winning band The xx, and Sampha as a distinctive singer, writer and producer associated with the Young label. Romy’s background in intimate, minimalist indie pop and club‑driven dance music and Sampha’s roots in soulful, piano‑led electronic R&B intersect in their joint work, which has been described as stylish, soulful UK pop with strong emotional undercurrents.[1][3][4][5]

Their collaborations have gradually formed a small but influential body of work. The pair first attracted attention performing and recording together on covers and live sets, including a duet cover of André 3000 that highlighted the blend of Romy’s ethereal tone with Sampha’s grainy, expressive vocal.[3] In 2023, Romy released her solo debut album “Mid Air,” grounded in dance‑pop and club culture, while Sampha prepared his second album “Lahai,” an expansive, intuitive record that furthered his reputation as a boundary‑pushing soul artist.[2][4][6] Around this period, they co‑wrote and recorded “Cumulus / Memory” for “Lahai” and later released the duet “I’m On Your Team,” a slow‑motion piano‑soul ballad about commitment, teamwork and long‑term love, which critics praised as a refined showcase for two of contemporary UK pop’s most recognizable voices.[3][4][5][7] While still a loose, project‑by‑project partnership rather than a formal group, Romy & Sampha’s work together is already noted for its emotional candour, subtle production and the way it fuses indie, soul and club sensibilities into a modern “indie soul” aesthetic.[1][3][4][5]

Individually, both artists have made significant contributions to modern popular music—Romy through her work with The xx and her dance‑oriented solo projects, Sampha via his Mercury Prize‑winning debut “Process,” the acclaimed follow‑up “Lahai,” and high‑profile collaborations with artists such as Drake, Solange and Kendrick Lamar.[1][2][6] Their intermittent partnership adds another dimension to their legacies: when they appear together, they tend to strip arrangements back to piano, subtle electronics and interwoven vocals, emphasizing lyrical honesty and emotional nuance. This has led commentators to frame Romy & Sampha not as a separate band with an independent history, but as a recurring collaborative identity under which two already influential artists explore shared themes of intimacy, memory and support.[3][4][5]

## Fun Facts
- Romy & Sampha first drew notice together by performing a cover of André 3000, a choice that underscored the duo’s shared admiration for emotionally rich, genre‑bending R&B and hip‑hop.[3]
- The track “Cumulus / Memory,” which features Romy on vocals and co‑writing, was both the first song Sampha wrote for his album “Lahai” and the last one he finished, meaning Romy’s contribution bookends the record’s creative timeline.[4]
- Critics have described “I’m On Your Team” as a “soulful slo‑mo piano ballad” where production is deliberately kept minimal so that Romy and Sampha’s voices can intertwine without being overwhelmed by arrangements.[3]
- Romy’s solo album “Mid Air,” which frames part of the context for her work with Sampha, was built around club and dance‑pop influences and produced by Fred again.., showing how club culture feeds into the softer, more intimate sound she shares with Sampha.[2]

## Musical Connections

### Mentors/Influences
- [[kwes|Kwes]] - London producer who guided Sampha early in his career, connecting him to key musicians and to his future label Young (then Young Turks) (Early demos, introductions that led to remixes like The xx’s “Basic Space”) [From around 2007 onward[1]]

### Key Collaborators
- [[romy_romy_madley_croft|Romy (Romy Madley Croft)]] - Co‑writer, duet partner and featured vocalist in a recurring collaborative partnership often referred to as Romy & Sampha (“I’m On Your Team”; “Cumulus / Memory”; joint live performances and an André 3000 cover) [Early 2020s–present[3][4][5]]
- [[the_xx|The xx]] - Indie band in which Romy is singer, guitarist and songwriter; her work there forms the foundation of the Romy & Sampha artistic identity (Three studio albums with The xx, collectively selling over 4 million copies) [Late 2000s–present[5]]
- [[young_label_artists_e.g._sbtrkt_jessie_ware_lil_silva_bullion|Young (label) artists (e.g., SBTRKT, Jessie Ware, Lil Silva, Bullion)]] - Sampha’s early collaborators from the Young label scene, shaping the sound he later brought into work with Romy (Remix of The xx’s “Basic Space”; various features and productions) [Late 2000s–2010s[1]]

### Artists Influenced
- [[emerging_uk_indiesoul_and_electronic_artists|Emerging UK indie‑soul and electronic artists]] - Romy and Sampha’s highly regarded solo and collaborative work is frequently cited as part of a broader wave of intimate, soulful UK pop that newer artists draw upon; this is an inference based on critical framing rather than explicit named proteges. (Sampha’s “Process” and “Lahai,” Romy’s “Mid Air,” and their duet “I’m On Your Team” as reference points) [Late 2010s–2020s (inferred from critical coverage)[1][2][3][4][6][7]]
