## Biography
Royal Southern Brotherhood is an American blues and blues rock supergroup that emerged in the early 2010s, bringing together five world-class musicians united by their shared passion for Southern music traditions. The band features Devon Allman (guitar, vocals) and Cyril Neville (vocals, percussion) as its primary creative forces, alongside Mike Zito (guitar, vocals), Charlie Wooton (bass), and Yonrico Scott (drums). Despite the inevitable 'supergroup' label stemming from the members' prestigious family histories and individual accomplishments, Royal Southern Brotherhood operates as a cohesive creative unit rather than a collection of egos. The band's approach emphasizes collaborative songwriting and tight interplay, with the dual guitar work of Devon and Mike weaving intricate stories atop the rhythmic foundation provided by Wooton and Scott.

The band's musical identity draws from an eclectic palette of influences spanning funk, soul, classic blues, and hard rock. Their self-titled debut album arrived in 2012, followed by the critically acclaimed 'HeartSoulBlood' in 2014, both recorded at the legendary Dockside Studios in Louisiana under the production guidance of Jim Gaines. The band has maintained an active touring schedule, performing across twenty-plus countries and releasing the live album 'Songs From The Road' in 2013. Rather than chasing commercial trends, Royal Southern Brotherhood has consistently prioritized artistic integrity, creating music designed to soundtrack people's lives while respecting blues and rock traditions while simultaneously pushing those genres into new creative territory.

The band's legacy centers on demonstrating that supergroups can transcend their individual members' reputations to create something genuinely unified and forward-thinking. By refusing to rely solely on genealogy or past accomplishments, Royal Southern Brotherhood has established itself as a bold creative force in contemporary blues rock, proving that the genre remains vital and evolving in the hands of dedicated musicians committed to both honoring and reimagining Southern musical traditions.

## Fun Facts

- The band completed the recording of their debut album in just seven days at Dockside Studios in February, capturing the creative magic that emerged when all five members convened together.
- Despite being labeled a 'supergroup' due to the legendary family histories of Devon Allman (Allman Brothers lineage) and Cyril Neville (Neville Brothers lineage), the band deliberately operates as a unified creative entity rather than five individual egos competing for supremacy.
- Royal Southern Brotherhood signed a deal with Ruf Records to make three albums, which included the 2013 live DVD/CD 'Songs From The Road,' demonstrating their commitment to capturing their dynamic live performances alongside studio work.
