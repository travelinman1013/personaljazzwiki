## Biography
Elder Roma Wilson (December 22, 1910 – October 25, 2018) was an American gospel harmonica player, singer, and Holiness preacher whose life bridged the worlds of rural Mississippi sharecropping, African American Pentecostal worship, and the international folk revival.[5][9] Born on his parents’ cotton farm near Hickory Flat in Benton County, Mississippi (some sources say Tupelo), he was one of ten children and began working in the fields at an early age.[2][8][9] As a teenager he taught himself to play harmonica, developing a powerful, chugging style suited to open-air services and noisy street corners, and was ordained as a minister by about eighteen, preaching and playing in Holiness and Church of God in Christ congregations and on the streets of towns across north Mississippi.[2][3] During the 1930s and 1940s he often performed with guitarist and fellow evangelist Leon Pinson, the pair becoming a celebrated local gospel duo though they remained largely unknown outside the region.[2]

In 1940 Wilson moved north to Detroit, part of the Great Migration, where he balanced factory and foundry work with his vocation as an itinerant street-corner and storefront-church preacher, playing harmonica and singing sanctified songs in African American neighborhoods.[3][9] Unbeknownst to him, some of his performances were recorded in the 1940s by field collectors and later issued on LP in the 1960s, quietly earning him a reputation among blues and folk enthusiasts as a master of gospel harmonica.[3][7] He did not learn of this international recognition until around age eighty, when an encounter in New Orleans with an East German fan revealed that his early sides had become cult favorites overseas.[7] This late discovery led to invitations to folk festivals and concerts, and in his eighties and nineties he finally enjoyed a modest recording and touring career, documented by releases such as the album “This Train is a Clean Train,” while continuing to preach and testify in performance.[3][7]

Wilson’s musical style blended the drive and syncopation of country blues harmonica with the call-and-response phrasing, testimonial energy, and shouted exhortations of Holiness preaching, creating a distinctive sound that functioned as both music and ministry.[3][5][9] He typically played in first position (straight harp), using dense chordal rhythms, train imitations, and vocal-like bends to underscore gospel standards such as “This Train,” “Amazing Grace,” and “I’m So Glad.”[3][7] Although he never achieved mainstream commercial fame, he became highly respected among folklorists, blues and gospel scholars, and harmonica players as one of the greatest exponents of African American sacred harmonica tradition.[3][5] In 1994 he received a National Heritage Fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts, the United States’ highest honor in folk and traditional arts, cementing his legacy as a culture bearer who preserved a vital strand of Southern Black religious and musical expression across more than seven decades of performance.[3][9]

## Fun Facts
- Wilson did not discover that his 1940s street performances had been recorded and released internationally until he was about 80 years old, when an East German fan recognized him and told him he was famous overseas.[7]
- He was still performing on harmonica past the age of 100, and accounts describe him playing energetically in his early 100s, embodying the image of the “harmonica preacher” well into extreme old age.[3][4]
- Although often associated with blues collectors and the Mississippi Blues Trail, Wilson himself identified primarily as a gospel musician and preacher, insisting that his harmonica was a tool for saving souls rather than entertaining.[3][5]
- In 1994 he received a National Heritage Fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts, a rare national honor that he earned only after decades of mostly anonymous street and church performances.[3][9]

## Musical Connections

### Mentors/Influences
- [[holiness_and_church_of_god_in_christ_preachers_unnamed|Holiness and Church of God in Christ preachers (unnamed)]] - Wilson was shaped by the Holiness and COGIC worship tradition, modeling his preaching and harmonica style on the ecstatic, call-and-response services and street evangelism of earlier ministers in those churches, although specific individual mentors are not named in the available sources. (General gospel repertory such as “This Train,” “Amazing Grace,” and other Holiness standards performed in church and on the street) [c. mid-1920s–1930s[2][3][9]]

### Key Collaborators
- [[leon_pinson|Leon Pinson]] - Gospel guitarist, singer, and fellow evangelist who worked closely with Wilson as a street-corner and church-performing duo in north Mississippi, combining Wilson’s harmonica and preaching with Pinson’s guitar and vocals. (Live evangelical performances around Holly Springs, Ripley, and other north Mississippi towns; their partnership is commemorated on the Mississippi Blues Trail marker “Roma Wilson & Leon Pinson.”) [Primarily 1930s–1940s, with later reunion performances at events such as the 1991 Mississippi Delta Blues Festival[2][3]]

### Artists Influenced
- [[gospel_and_blues_harmonica_players_in_the_folk_and_blues_revival_various_unnamed|Gospel and blues harmonica players in the folk and blues revival (various, unnamed)]] - Wilson’s 1940s field recordings and later releases became touchstones for players studying African American sacred harmonica; scholars and enthusiasts credit him as a major reference for learning sanctified harmonica style, though specific individual proteges are not identified in primary sources. (Influence traced through reissue LPs of his 1940s recordings and later albums such as “This Train is a Clean Train,” widely studied among traditional harmonica communities.[3][7]) [From the 1960s blues/folk revival onward, especially after his recordings were reissued and he began appearing at festivals in the 1980s–1990s[3][7]]
