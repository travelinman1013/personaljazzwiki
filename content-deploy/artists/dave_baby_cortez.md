## Biography
Dave "Baby" Cortez, born David Cortez Clowney on August 13, 1938, in Detroit, Michigan, was a pioneering American pop and R&B organist and pianist. Raised in a musical household—his father was a pianist who encouraged his early interest—Cortez began with the piano, playing for nearly a decade before switching to the organ, the instrument that would define his career. As a teenager, he joined local doo-wop groups such as The Five Pearls and The Valentines, gaining early experience as both a singer and pianist.

Cortez's breakthrough came in 1959 with "The Happy Organ," the first pop/rock hit to feature the electronic organ as the lead instrument. The track, recorded almost by chance when Cortez experimented with a Hammond organ in the studio, became the first instrumental No. 1 on Billboard's Hot 100 chart. He followed with further hits like "Rinky Dink" and "The Whispering Organ," cementing his reputation as Michigan's most successful instrumental artist of his era. Cortez recorded for 18 different labels between 1954 and 1974, and after a long hiatus, returned in 2011 with a jazz-inspired album. He passed away on May 31, 2022, in New York City, but his innovative use of the organ and infectious melodies left a lasting legacy on popular music.

## Fun Facts

- Cortez's 1962 hit "Rinky Dink" became the theme for the UK television program Professional Wrestling.
- After decades of privacy, Cortez's passing in 2022 was not widely known until 2025, and he is buried in an unmarked grave on Hart Island, New York.
