## Biography
Pearl Woods, born Lily Pearl Woodard on September 24, 1933, in St. Matthews, South Carolina, was an influential American singer, songwriter, and producer whose work bridged the genres of northern soul and early rock and roll. She moved to New York in 1951, where her career began to flourish as she immersed herself in the vibrant music scene. Woods was known for her powerful, emotive voice and her ability to craft songs that resonated with both R&B and soul audiences. 

Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, Woods released a series of singles, including the notable "Be My Baby" and "My Love Is Your Love" in 1956, which featured prominent backup vocals and showcased her talent for blending heartfelt lyrics with infectious rhythms. She frequently collaborated with her husband and songwriting partner, Freddy Johnson, and together they contributed to the development of the northern soul sound that would later gain cult status among collectors and DJs.

Her song "Something's Got a Hold on Me" has been widely sampled in global hits such as Avicii's "Levels" and Flo Rida's "Good Feeling," introducing her work to new generations and cementing her influence in modern music.
