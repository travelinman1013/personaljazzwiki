## Biography
Brain Damage & Emiko Ota is a collaborative project uniting French dub pioneer Martin Nathan, known as Brain Damage, with Osaka‑born Japanese multidisciplinary artist, drummer, percussionist, and singer Emiko Ota.[1][2][3][4][6] Nathan founded Brain Damage in Saint‑Étienne in 1999 as one of France’s earliest live dub formations, gradually evolving from sound‑system‑oriented roots and UK‑style dub into increasingly experimental, concept‑driven works he now describes as “post‑dub.”[2][3][4][6] Over more than two decades he has explored themes ranging from colonial history to transnational cultural exchange, collaborating with Jamaican, Colombian and other international artists while continually stretching the formal language of dub.[2] Ota, by contrast, emerged in the 1980s Osaka underground rock scene (notably with the experimental punk band OXZ) before building a wide‑ranging career in Paris and beyond, traversing traditional Japanese min’yō and gagaku, psychedelic surf rock, children’s songs, anime‑song cover projects, and work with artists from both mainstream and underground cultures.[1][2]

Their collaboration crystallized on the 2025 release *Oide Oide*, credited to Brain Damage, Emiko Ota, and UK dub legend Mad Professor, and issued by the French label Jarring Effects.[1][3][4][6] Conceived by Nathan as a “post‑dub” project, the record is structured around five Japanese yōkai—Katsura Otoko, Tenome, Isogashi, Azuki Arai, and Baku—selected by Ota to match distinct musical atmospheres, each then mirrored by a corresponding dub version.[1][2][3][4] Ota’s voice and narrative presence take the lead role, shifting from whispers to theatrical declamation as she embodies these supernatural creatures, while Brain Damage’s spacious, bass‑heavy production and Mad Professor’s mixing‑desk wizardry anchor the project in dub tradition even as it veers into experimental sound design and folkloric storytelling.[1][3][4][5][6] Reviewers have characterized the result as otherworldly “post‑dub” that fuses esoteric Japanese myth with European dub innovation, underscoring the pair’s legacy as boundary‑pushers who use the Brain Damage & Emiko Ota collaboration to bridge scenes, eras, and cultures in a singular, immersive work.[1][2][3][4][5][6]

Beyond *Oide Oide*, Ota’s connection to the Brain Damage universe pre‑dates the EP, having appeared on the 2019 release *Combat Dub 4 – Revisited* on the track “Under the Ground,” which further demonstrates her adaptability within dub contexts and Nathan’s ongoing interest in cross‑cultural dialogue.[7] In the broader landscape of contemporary dub and experimental music, Brain Damage & Emiko Ota stands as a meeting point between the long arc of French dub innovation and the equally long, if less widely documented, history of Japanese experimental rock and traditional music practice, offering a hybrid style where echo‑laden basslines, electronic textures, and meticulous sound design coexist with yōkai narratives, Japanese vocal techniques, and theatrical performance.[1][2][3][4][6] While still a relatively recent collaboration, commentary around *Oide Oide* emphasizes its role as both a “rebirth” for Brain Damage’s sound and a showcase for Ota’s reputation as a “chameleon musician,” suggesting a continuing influence on how dub can interact with folklore, performance art, and transnational collaboration.[2][3]

## Fun Facts
- Emiko Ota is often described by collaborators as a “chameleon musician” because she comfortably moves between Osaka punk/experimental rock, traditional Japanese folk and court music, anime‑song covers, children’s songs, surf‑psychedelia, and avant‑garde performance, all of which inform her work with Brain Damage.[1][2]
- *Oide Oide* is structured around five specific yōkai—Katsura Otoko, Tenome, Isogashi, Azuki Arai, and Baku—each chosen by Ota to match an instrumental atmosphere provided by Brain Damage, effectively turning the record into a mini compendium of Japanese folklore in dub form.[1][2][3]
- Critics have labeled *Oide Oide* a “post‑dub” record because, while it is built on classic dub elements like heavy bass, echo, and versioning, it also works as a theatrical, narrative piece where Ota’s character‑based vocals and storytelling are as central as the rhythm tracks.[1][2][3][4]
- Before taking a leading role on *Oide Oide*, Emiko Ota had already appeared in the Brain Damage universe on the 2019 release *Combat Dub 4 – Revisited* via the track “Under the Ground,” hinting at the deeper collaboration that would fully emerge several years later.[7]
