## Biography
The Wild Magnolias are a legendary Mardi Gras Indian group and funk band originating from New Orleans, Louisiana. Their roots trace back to the 1950s, when they participated in the city's vibrant 'Indian masking' traditions, but their modern incarnation began in 1964 when Theodore 'Bo' Dollis became Big Chief. Dollis, who had previously masked with other tribes, transformed the Wild Magnolias from a traditional street group into a musical force, blending the rhythms and chants of Mardi Gras Indian music with funk, R&B, and New Orleans jazz influences.

The group gained wider attention in 1970 with the release of their single 'Handa Wanda,' recorded with local R&B musicians including pianist Willie Tee and guitarist Snooks Eaglin. Their fusion of street percussion and funk instrumentation created a new genre of New Orleans music, leading to two acclaimed albums in the 1970s and performances at venues like Carnegie Hall. Despite setbacks, including limited U.S. album releases, the Wild Magnolias became fixtures at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival and toured internationally. The band's sound evolved over time, incorporating brass bands and collaborating with artists such as Dr. John and the ReBirth Brass Band. After Bo Dollis' passing in 2015, his son, Bo Dollis Jr., assumed leadership, ensuring the group's legacy endures as both cultural ambassadors and innovators in New Orleans music.
