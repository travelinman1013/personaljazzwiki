## Biography
Charmaine Neville (born March 31, 1956) is an American jazz, funk, and rhythm-and-blues singer from New Orleans, Louisiana, and a prominent member of the city’s storied Neville musical family.[1][4][7] The daughter of saxophonist Charles Neville of The Neville Brothers, she grew up in a deeply musical Catholic household in New Orleans where music, parades, and Mardi Gras traditions were part of daily life.[1][3][7] Surrounded by her father, uncles, and other local musicians, she began singing as a child and was performing by the time she was very young, gradually developing a strong stage presence, a powerful voice, and a fierce sense of artistic independence as the first woman in her family to “go [her] own way” musically.[1][3]

Neville’s professional career began backing up The Neville Brothers and later performing with The Survivors, a band whose alumni include Harry Connick Jr. and Bobby McFerrin, before she formed her own ensemble, the Charmaine Neville Band.[1][2] Co-led with longtime keyboardist Amasa Miller, the band became a fixture at New Orleans venues such as Snug Harbor and a regular attraction at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, known for a “Crescent City gumbo” of blues, funk, R&B, jazz standards, and ballads.[1][2][5][7] She has released several albums, including *It’s About Time* (1992), *All the Way Live at Snug Harbor* (1992), *Up Up Up* (1996), *Live at Bourbon Street Music Club/Live in Brazil* (1996), *Queen of the Mardi Gras* (1998), and *Jazz Fest Live 2007*, as well as the later CD *Before the Storm*.[1][2] Neville is also known for her resilience and activism; after surviving Hurricane Katrina in 2005, she publicly recounted her harrowing experience and became a symbol of New Orleans’ persistence and community spirit.[1] Beyond recordings and performances, she has hosted radio segments, appeared on television (including a guest spot on *Touched by an Angel* and a nationally televised Motown special), and is widely regarded within New Orleans as a demanding, perfectionist bandleader and a beloved “sweetheart” of the local music community.[2][3]

Stylistically, Neville blends New Orleans funk, jump jazz, blues shouts, R&B energy, and jazz-inflected ballads, often emphasizing storytelling and audience connection in her live shows.[1][2][5] While proud of her heritage, she has repeatedly stressed that she is “not a Neville Brother” but a distinct artist who refuses to simply emulate her famous relatives, insisting on being taken seriously on her own terms.[3][5] Her legacy rests on her contributions to sustaining and evolving New Orleans music, mentoring younger players informally on bandstands and tours, and representing the strength of women in a historically male-dominated local scene.[3][7] Through decades of club dates, festival sets, collaborations, and recordings, Charmaine Neville has become an enduring figure in the cultural life of New Orleans and a respected bearer and shaper of its musical traditions.[1][2][7]

## Fun Facts
- Neville was the first woman in her famous musical family to strike out entirely on her own stylistically, insisting that she was “not a Neville Brother” and refusing to simply copy their sound.[3]
- She is known in New Orleans circles as the so‑called “sweetheart” of the music scene, a label she half-jokingly rejects because she considers herself a perfectionist and “a monster” about getting the music right.[3]
- After Hurricane Katrina, Neville’s vivid public account of surviving the storm and fleeing the city by bus became widely shared, turning her into an informal spokesperson for the resilience of New Orleanians.[1]
- Neville has said she intends to keep performing into extreme old age, joking that she will be “a little old lady on a walker” who dies on stage still singing.[2]
