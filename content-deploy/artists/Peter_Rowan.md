## Biography
Peter Rowan, born July 4, 1942 in Wayland, Massachusetts, is a Grammy Award-winning singer-songwriter and a foundational figure in American roots music. Raised in a musical family, Rowan was introduced to guitar by his uncle and immersed himself in Boston’s vibrant folk and country scene as a teenager, frequenting legendary venues like the Hillbilly Ranch. He formed his first band, the Cupids, in high school, initially performing rockabilly before gravitating toward folk and bluegrass.

Rowan’s professional career began in 1963 when he joined Bill Monroe’s Blue Grass Boys as a singer, rhythm guitarist, and songwriter, co-writing bluegrass standards such as “Walls of Time.” After leaving Monroe’s band, Rowan became a key player in genre-blending ensembles including Earth Opera, Seatrain, Muleskinner, and the Rowans (with his brothers Chris and Lorin). In the early 1970s, he co-founded Old & In the Way with David Grisman, Jerry Garcia, Vassar Clements, and John Kahn, penning the classic “Panama Red.” Rowan’s solo work and collaborations have spanned bluegrass, newgrass, Americana, and beyond, earning him induction into the International Bluegrass Music Hall of Fame in 2022.

Renowned for his soulful vocals, innovative songwriting, and genre-crossing collaborations, Rowan’s legacy is marked by a restless creativity and a deep reverence for tradition. His influence endures through a prolific recording career, constant touring, and a lasting impact on generations of bluegrass and Americana musicians.
