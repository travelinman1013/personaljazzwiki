## Biography
Brad Walker is a prominent saxophonist and composer based in New Orleans, recognized for his expressive and story-driven approach to jazz. Originally from North Carolina, Walker moved to New Orleans in 2009 after completing his Bachelor of Music in classical saxophone performance and a Master of Music in jazz studies at Louisiana State University. Immersing himself in the vibrant Crescent City scene, he quickly became one of its most sought-after performers, praised for his energetic and tasteful solos on national platforms such as Saturday Night Live and the Grammys, especially with country artist Sturgill Simpson.

Walker's career is marked by versatility and collaboration. He has released five full-length albums under his own name, including the critically acclaimed 'Quintet' (2014). In 2022, he joined forces with the acclaimed jazz trio Extended—keyboardist Oscar Rossignoli, bassist Matt Booth, and drummer Brad Webb—to form Brad Walker & Extended. Their album 'Side By Side' showcases a blend of original compositions and imaginative reworkings of classical pieces, highlighting Walker's lyrical tenor and soprano saxophone voice. His music is characterized by a balance of narrative depth and improvisational freedom, often exploring the intersections of jazz, Latin, and classical influences.

Walker’s contributions to the New Orleans jazz community have been recognized with multiple nominations for the OffBeat Magazine 'Best of the Beat' Awards and the Big Easy Awards.
