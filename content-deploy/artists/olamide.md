## Biography
Olamide Adedeji, popularly known as Olamide or Olamide Baddo, was born on March 15, 1989, in Bariga, Lagos State, Nigeria. Raised in a modest family, he developed an early interest in music, initially aspiring to be a footballer before discovering his talent for rap at age 11. He attended primary and secondary school in Lagos and later studied Mass Communication at Tai Solarin University of Education.

Olamide's professional music career began in 2010 with the release of his debut single 'Eni Duro,' which quickly gained traction and led to a performance at the Hip-Hop World Awards. His first studio album, 'Rapsodi' (2011), was released under Coded Tunes, and he soon established his own label, YBNL Nation, releasing the influential album 'YBNL' in 2012. Olamide is celebrated for his dynamic blend of hip hop, afrobeats, and indigenous Yoruba lyricism, which has helped popularize the modern Nigerian street sound. Over the years, he has released numerous successful albums, won multiple awards, and become a central figure in Nigeria's music industry.

Beyond his own artistry, Olamide has played a pivotal role in shaping the careers of emerging talents through YBNL Nation, notably launching the careers of Adekunle Gold and Fireboy DML. His legacy is defined by his consistent hit-making ability, cultural influence, and commitment to uplifting new voices in Afrobeats and hip hop.
