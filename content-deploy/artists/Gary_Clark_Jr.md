## Biography
Gary Clark Jr., born on February 15, 1984, in Austin, Texas, emerged from the city’s storied blues scene to become one of the most acclaimed modern blues musicians of his generation. Raised in a musically rich environment, Clark began playing guitar at age twelve and quickly became a fixture in Austin’s vibrant club circuit during his teens. His early promise was recognized by Clifford Antone, owner of the legendary Antone’s nightclub, who introduced him to key figures in the Texas blues community, including Jimmie Vaughan. This mentorship helped Clark refine his craft and establish his reputation as a prodigious guitarist and performer.

Clark’s career accelerated with the release of his major-label debut, 'The Bright Lights EP' in 2011, followed by the genre-blending albums 'Blak and Blu' (2012), 'The Story of Sonny Boy Slim' (2015), and 'This Land' (2019). His music fuses traditional blues with rock, soul, and elements of hip hop, earning him multiple Grammy Awards and critical acclaim for both his studio recordings and electrifying live performances. Clark’s guitar work, emotive vocals, and songwriting have positioned him as a torchbearer for contemporary blues, while his willingness to experiment has expanded the genre’s boundaries. His most recent album, 'JPEG Raw,' was released in 2024, further cementing his legacy as a modern blues innovator.
