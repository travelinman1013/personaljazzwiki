## Biography
Earl King, born Earl Silas Johnson IV on February 7, 1934, in New Orleans, Louisiana, emerged as one of the most influential figures in the city’s vibrant R&B and blues scene. Raised by his mother after his father—a pianist—passed away in his infancy, King’s early musical exposure came from singing gospel in church. By age 15, he had picked up the guitar and began performing in local talent contests, quickly making a name for himself at legendary venues like the Dew Drop Inn. A pivotal moment came when he met his idol, Guitar Slim, whose style left a lasting mark on King’s approach to guitar and songwriting. When Guitar Slim was injured in 1954, King was asked to fill in for him on tour, an experience that cemented his reputation as a performer and led to regular gigs in New Orleans’ top clubs.

King’s recording career began in the early 1950s under the name Earl Johnson, but he soon adopted the stage name Earl King. He signed with Ace Records in 1955, scoring a hit with "Those Lonely, Lonely Nights" and establishing himself as a prolific songwriter. Over the next five decades, King wrote and recorded hundreds of songs, many of which became standards of New Orleans R&B, including "Come On (Let the Good Times Roll)," "Big Chief," and "Trick Bag." His music blended the syncopated rhythms and storytelling traditions of New Orleans with blues, R&B, and later, funk influences. King’s songs were covered by artists such as Jimi Hendrix, Stevie Ray Vaughan, and The Meters, ensuring his influence extended far beyond his hometown.

Despite health challenges later in life, King remained a vital force in New Orleans music until his death in 2003. His lyrical wit, inventive guitar work, and deep connection to the city’s musical heritage earned him a reputation as a "poet laureate" of New Orleans R&B. Today, his compositions are still performed at Mardi Gras and celebrated by musicians and fans alike for their enduring creativity and spirit.
