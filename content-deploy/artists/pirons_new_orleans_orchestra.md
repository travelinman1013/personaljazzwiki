## Biography
Piron's New Orleans Orchestra was founded and led by Armand John 'A.J.' Piron, a Creole violinist born in New Orleans in 1888. Raised in a musically gifted family, Piron began playing violin professionally as a teenager and quickly established himself as a leading figure in the city's vibrant music scene. By 1912, he was leading the Olympia Orchestra, and in 1915, he co-founded New Orleans’ first African-American music publishing house with pianist Clarence Williams, further cementing his influence on early jazz.

In 1918, Piron formed his own ensemble, Piron's New Orleans Orchestra, which became renowned for its sophisticated, melodic, and 'genteel' Creole jazz style. The group featured top local musicians and was celebrated for its polished performances, often playing at prestigious venues such as the New Orleans Country Club and Spanish Fort. In 1923, the orchestra traveled to New York City, securing a residency at the Roseland Ballroom and recording for major labels like Okeh, Victor, and Columbia. Their success in New York helped spread the New Orleans jazz sound nationally, though the band eventually returned home, where Piron continued to lead the orchestra into the 1930s, adapting its style to changing musical tastes until his death in 1943.

Piron's New Orleans Orchestra is remembered as one of the best-paid and most influential African-American bands of its era, blending Creole musical traditions with early jazz and leaving a lasting legacy on American music. Their recordings and performances influenced both contemporaries and future jazz musicians, and Piron's composition 'I Wish That I Could Shimmy Like My Sister Kate' became a nationwide hit.
