## Biography
Rosie Ledet, born Mary Roszela Bellard on October 25, 1971, in Church Point, Louisiana, is a pioneering American Creole zydeco accordionist, singer, and songwriter. Raised in rural Louisiana, Ledet initially favored rock music and showed little interest in zydeco despite its prevalence in her community. Her passion for zydeco was ignited at age sixteen after attending a dance at Richard's Club in Lawtell, where Boozoo Chavis's performance inspired her to learn the genre. It was at this event that she met her future husband, Morris Ledet, who would become her musical partner and bandmate.[1][2][3][4][5][7]

Ledet taught herself to play the accordion by observing Morris and practicing on his instrument. As her talent grew, Morris transitioned to playing bass guitar in her band, allowing Rosie to take the spotlight. With the support of producer Mike Lachney and Maison de Soul label owner Floyd Soileau, she released her debut album, "Sweet Brown Sugar," in 1994, marking the start of her professional career. Ledet quickly gained recognition for her energetic accordion style, sultry vocals, and clever, suggestive lyrics, performing in both Creole French and English. She has recorded more than a dozen albums and remains a popular attraction at festivals such as the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival.[1][2][3][4][5][6][7]

Rosie Ledet is celebrated for breaking barriers in the male-dominated zydeco genre, offering a unique female perspective through her songwriting and performances. Her "sped-up blues" approach and ability to write most of her own material have broadened the genre's appeal and inspired other women to pursue careers in zydeco. Ledet continues to tour and record with her band, the Zydeco Playboys, and is regarded as a beacon of female empowerment and innovation within Louisiana's vibrant music scene.[2][5][6]
