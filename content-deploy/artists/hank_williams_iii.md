## Biography
Shelton Hank Williams III, known professionally as Hank Williams III or Hank 3, was born on December 12, 1972, in Nashville, Tennessee, into one of country music’s most famous families as the son of Hank Williams Jr. and the grandson of Hank Williams Sr.[1][4] Raised primarily by his mother in a working-class environment rather than in industry luxury, he gravitated first to hard rock, punk, and metal, playing drums in local hardcore and punk bands around Nashville and the Southeast instead of immediately embracing the family’s country legacy.[1][3] His striking vocal resemblance to his grandfather and his bloodline made him instantly marketable in Nashville, but he remained ambivalent about mainstream country and the expectations attached to the Williams name.[1]

In the mid‑1990s, financial pressures, particularly steep child support obligations, pushed Williams toward a professional country career, leading to a contract with Curb Records and his participation in the 1996 album “Three Hanks: Men with Broken Hearts,” which digitally united the voices of Hank Sr., Hank Jr., and Hank III.[1][4] His solo debut, “Risin’ Outlaw” (1999), earned solid reviews and sales, but he later dismissed it as over-produced and unrepresentative of his vision.[1][2][4] He followed with “Lovesick, Broke & Driftin’” (2002), which he wrote, produced, recorded, and mixed largely on his own, asserting greater creative control and a darker, more personal sound.[1][4] His relationship with Curb became notoriously contentious: the label shelved his album “This Ain’t Country,” later issuing it without his consent as “Hillbilly Joker” (2011), and he publicly protested with “F*** Curb” merchandise.[1][4] After contractual battles, he released the double-disc “Straight to Hell” (2006), notable as one of the first major-label country releases to carry a parental advisory sticker and for its raw, unapologetically “outlaw” stance.[4]

Williams’ musical style fuses **outlaw country**, honky tonk, and traditional instrumentation with cowpunk, psychobilly, and extreme metal, reflecting his twin identities in roots music and underground rock.[1][3][4] His lyrics frequently deal with drug use, hedonism, hard living, and criticism of the Nashville commercial system, positioning him as a modern inheritor of the outsider ethos associated with his grandfather.[4] Live, he is known for marathon “Jekyll and Hyde” shows that begin with a classic-leaning country set (often with fiddle and pedal steel), then shift into a hellbilly/cowpunk segment, and finally culminate in a high-intensity metal set with his band Assjack.[4] From 2011 onward, operating via his own Hank3 Records imprint with Megaforce distribution, he released a flurry of stylistically diverse projects—including the country double album “Ghost to a Ghost/Gutter Town,” the experimental metal record “3 Bar Ranch Cattle Callin’,” the doom-rock project “Attention Deficit Domination,” and later the country album “Brothers of the 4×4” and the punk album “A Fiendish Threat”—cementing his reputation as one of modern country’s most uncompromising and genre-defiant figures.[3][4]

## Fun Facts
- Hank Williams III initially earned his living playing drums in punk and metal bands around Nashville and the Southeast, only turning seriously to country music in the mid‑1990s when court-ordered child support obligations forced him to seek more stable income.[1][3]
- His 2006 album “Straight to Hell” became one of the first major-label country records to bear a parental advisory sticker, and it was released in both censored and uncensored forms after battles with Walmart over its content.[4]
- For years he fought with Curb Records over creative control; the label refused to release his album “This Ain’t Country” and later issued it without his approval under the title “Hillbilly Joker” after his contract ended.[1][4]
- Hank III’s live shows are famously structured in three distinct sets: a traditional country/honky tonk segment, followed by a louder “hellbilly” cowpunk/psychobilly set, and finally an all‑out metal performance with his band Assjack, often all in a single night.[4]

## Musical Connections

### Mentors/Influences
- [[hank_williams_sr|Hank Williams Sr.]] - Grandfather and overarching artistic influence; his vocal style and outlaw image heavily shaped Hank III’s approach, helped by a close vocal resemblance that framed expectations and informed his traditional honky tonk side. (Early exposure via family legacy and participation on the compilation “Three Hanks: Men with Broken Hearts,” which digitally combined all three generations’ voices.) [Lifelong influence; prominently highlighted since the mid‑1990s and the 1996 “Three Hanks” project.[1][4][6]]
- [[hank_williams_jr|Hank Williams Jr.]] - Father and model of a rebellious, rock-influenced country artist; their joint appearance on “Three Hanks: Men with Broken Hearts” publicly linked Hank III to the family tradition while he developed his own more extreme hybrid style. (“Three Hanks: Men with Broken Hearts” (1996), which earned Hank Jr. and Hank III a Vocal Duo of the Year nomination from the Academy of Country Music.) [Mid‑1990s onward in Hank III’s commercial country career.[1][4]]
- [[punk_and_hardcore_bands_of_the_southeast_underground|Punk and hardcore bands of the Southeast underground]] - While not specific named mentors, the regional punk and hardcore scenes in which Hank III drummed shaped his aggressive rhythmic sense and his later psychobilly and metal work, blending DIY ethics with his country roots. (Pre-fame live work in various unnamed punk and metal bands in Nashville and the broader Southeast club circuit.) [Late 1980s–early/mid‑1990s formative years.[1][3]]

### Key Collaborators
- [[the_damn_band|The Damn Band]] - Primary touring and recording country/hellbilly band backing Hank III onstage and in the studio, especially for his honky tonk and outlaw country material. (Extensive touring worldwide; featured in live presentations of albums such as “Risin’ Outlaw,” “Lovesick, Broke & Driftin’,” and “Straight to Hell.”) [Late 1990s–2010s.[4][5]]
- [[assjack|Assjack]] - Hank III’s own metal band and alter-ego project, providing the third, heaviest segment of his live shows and documenting his integration of hardcore, metalcore, and death metal into his repertoire. (Live sets following his country and hellbilly segments; studio work under the Assjack name accompanying his broader discography.) [Early 2000s–2010s.[1][4][5]]
- [[superjoint_ritual|Superjoint Ritual]] - New Orleans-based metal band led by Pantera frontman Phil Anselmo; Hank III played bass, linking him directly to the extreme metal community. (Live performances and recordings as bassist in Superjoint Ritual, strengthening his credibility in the metal underground.) [Early 2000s, concurrent with his Curb-era disputes.[1]]
- [[tom_waits|Tom Waits]] - Guest collaborator bringing avant-folk and experimental rock credibility to Hank III’s independent releases. (Appeared on the 2-disc country/ambient/folk project “Ghost to a Ghost/Gutter Town.”) [Circa 2011 independent release period.[4]]
- [[les_claypool|Les Claypool]] - Primus bassist known for experimental rock and funk-metal; his presence underscores Hank III’s cross-genre appeal. (Guest appearance on projects released simultaneously in 2011, including “Ghost to a Ghost/Gutter Town,” “3 Bar Ranch Cattle Callin’,” and/or “Attention Deficit Domination.”) [2011 collaboration era.[4]]
- [[alan_king_hellstomper|Alan King (Hellstomper)]] - Underground country/rock musician contributing to Hank III’s independent recordings. (Guest on the 2011 run of releases, particularly the country-oriented “Ghost to a Ghost/Gutter Town.”) [2011.[4]]
- [[ray_lawrence_jr|Ray Lawrence Jr.]] - Traditional-leaning country singer whose collaboration reinforced Hank III’s connection to roots country outside the mainstream. (Guest appearances on “Ghost to a Ghost/Gutter Town.”) [2011.[4]]
- [[troy_medlin_sourvein|Troy Medlin (Sourvein)]] - Doom/sludge musician contributing to Hank III’s heavier, doom-influenced material. (Guest on “Attention Deficit Domination,” Hank III’s doom-rock project.) [2011.[4]]
- [[dave_sherman_earthride|Dave Sherman (Earthride)]] - Doom metal artist who appeared on Hank III’s heavy projects, reinforcing his bona fides in the doom and stoner scenes. (Guest involvement on “Attention Deficit Domination.”) [2011.[4]]
- [[david_mcelfresh|David McElfresh]] - Fiddle player central to the country portion of Hank III’s live shows, helping maintain a traditional honky tonk sound. (Regular member of his touring setup, especially on the opening country sets of his three-part concerts.) [2000s–2010s.[4]]
- [[dan_johnson|Dan Johnson]] - Steel guitar player whose work in Hank III’s band anchors the classic country sonics of his live arrangements. (Live performances in the country segments of Hank III’s shows.) [2000s–2010s.[4]]

### Artists Influenced
- [[modern_hellbilly_cowpunk_and_psychobilly_country_artists_various|Modern hellbilly, cowpunk, and psychobilly country artists (various)]] - Hank III’s fusion of traditional honky tonk with punk and metal, his anti-Nashville stance, and his DIY independent releases have made him a touchstone for younger underground country and roots artists who blend heavy music and classic country. Specific direct protégés are not extensively documented, but coverage of the genre frequently cites him as a key figure in keeping outlaw country’s rebellious spirit alive in the 21st century. (Albums such as “Straight to Hell,” “Ghost to a Ghost/Gutter Town,” and his triple-release year in 2011 are often referenced as templates for mixing extreme genres with country while remaining outside mainstream Nashville.) [Mid‑2000s onward, particularly after the release of “Straight to Hell” (2006) and the independent records starting in 2011.[3][4][6]]
