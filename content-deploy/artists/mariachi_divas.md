## Quick Info
- **Genres**: mariachi, ranchera
- **Spotify Popularity**: 31/100
- **Followers**: 5,991
- **Origin**: Los Angeles, California, United States (group origin; founder Cindy Shea was born and raised in Los Angeles).[2][7]

## Biography
Mariachi Divas de Cindy Shea is an all-female mariachi ensemble founded in 1999 by trumpet player and musical director **Cindy Shea** in Southern California.[2][3][4][5] Born and raised in Los Angeles, Shea grew up surrounded by mariachi sounds before formally embracing the genre and envisioning a professional, women-led ensemble in what had long been a male-dominated field.[1][7] Under her leadership, Mariachi Divas quickly emerged on the regional circuit for their virtuosic playing, polished stagecraft, and fresh approach to traditional repertoire, soon becoming a staple at festivals, cultural celebrations, and media appearances across California and beyond.[1][2]

Over the next two decades, the group developed a distinctive musical identity that fuses **traditional mariachi and ranchera** with elements of jazz and pop, often featuring sophisticated arrangements and elegant, smooth vocal harmonies.[1][2][3][5] Their discography has grown to around twenty full-length albums produced or co-produced by Shea, released primarily through East Side Records, showcasing both classic songs and original compositions.[2][3][5] A significant turning point came in 2003, when Mariachi Divas became the official all-female mariachi of **Walt Disney Parks and Resorts**, performing year-round at Disneyland, Disney California Adventure, and Downtown Disney in Anaheim, and later serving as the official mariachi ensemble for Disney–Pixar’s *Coco*-inspired Plaza de la Familia / Día de los Muertos celebrations.[2] Their profile grew further through work in film, television, commercials, and live-to-film events, including *Coco: A Live-to-Film Concert Experience* at the Hollywood Bowl.[5]

Mariachi Divas’ impact is underscored by multiple major industry honors: they are **two-time GRAMMY Award winners** with at least eight GRAMMY nominations and three Latin GRAMMY nominations, making them one of the most decorated mariachi ensembles of their generation.[1][2][3][5] Their original song “Así es una mujer” earned both a Global Music Award and a Hollywood Music in Media Award in the Latin (Traditional) category, further cementing their artistic stature.[5] Beyond accolades, their legacy lies in their role as a pioneering, visible platform for women in mariachi, bringing together musicians from diverse cultural backgrounds and expanding audience expectations of what a mariachi group can sound and look like.[1][2] By combining respect for tradition with stylistic experimentation and high production values, Mariachi Divas has helped redefine modern mariachi while inspiring a new wave of female and mixed-gender ensembles throughout the United States and abroad.[1][3][7]
