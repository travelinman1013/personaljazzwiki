## Biography
Sharel Cassity (pronounced “Sha-Relle”) is an American saxophonist, flutist, composer, and educator known for her vibrant voice on the New York and Chicago jazz scenes.[2][4][6] Born in Iowa City, Iowa, she grew up in a musical family—her father is a pianist and keyboardist—and began piano almost as soon as she could reach the keys, initially imagining a career as a concert pianist.[1][7] After begging for a saxophone from around age eight, she received one at nine and by fourteen had committed herself to jazz, inspired in part by watching her father perform with jazz trios.[1][7] She studied at the University of Central Oklahoma (1996–1999), then transferred to The New School for Jazz and Contemporary Music, earning her BFA in 2005, and later completed a master’s degree in music at The Juilliard School under a full scholarship in 2007.[1][2][8]  

Establishing herself in New York from 2000 to 2016, Cassity became a member of the Dizzy Gillespie All-Star Big Band in 2008 and went on to work with ensembles such as the Jimmy Heath Big Band, Queens Jazz Orchestra, Nicholas Payton’s Big Band, the Roy Hargrove Big Band, Cyrus Chestnut’s groups, and the DIVA Jazz Orchestra, touring internationally to 27 countries.[2][3][8] As a leader she has released multiple albums—among them “Just for You” (2008), “Relentless” (2009), “Manhattan Romance” (2014), “Evolve” (2018), and “Fearless” (2019)—through labels including her own imprints ReIsha Music and Relsha Works; her recordings have drawn critical praise and coverage from publications such as DownBeat, JazzTimes, Jazziz, the Chicago Tribune, the New York Times, and Saxophone Journal.[1][2][3][6] Her style is rooted in modern and post‑bop traditions, combining strong bebop vocabulary with contemporary harmonic and rhythmic concepts, and she has performed with notable figures including Herbie Hancock, Wynton Marsalis, Roy Hargrove, Dee Dee Bridgewater, Jimmy Heath, Christian McBride, Aretha Franklin, Jennifer Hudson, Natalie Merchant, Vanessa Williams, and others in both jazz and popular settings.[1][2][3][5]  

Now based in the Chicago area, Cassity balances performance with an active educational and community‑focused career.[2][3][6] She is on the jazz and classical faculty at DePaul University, Columbia College Chicago, and Elgin Community College, teaching jazz pedagogy, saxophone, flute, and piano, and she founded the Jazz Up! / Jazz Up Institute programs to provide diverse high‑school jazz students regular opportunities to improvise and prepare for collegiate or professional life.[1][2][3][6] After a serious, initially mysterious illness later diagnosed as Lyme disease around 2019, she continued to perform and record—adapting her equipment to keep playing—completing her album “Fearless” even while facing uncertain health prospects, an experience that deepened the sense of gratitude and resilience reflected in her recent work.[1] Her contributions as an improviser, bandleader, and mentor have been recognized with honors such as the ASCAP Young Jazz Composer Award, inclusion in the Oklahoma Jazz Hall of Fame, and a 2023 DownBeat Magazine “Rising Star Alto Saxophone” citation, underscoring both her artistic impact and her growing legacy as a role model for younger musicians.[2][3][5][6]
