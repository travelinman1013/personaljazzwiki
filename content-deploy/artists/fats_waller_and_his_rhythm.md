## Biography
Thomas Wright "Fats" Waller (May 21, 1904 – December 15, 1943) was a pioneering American jazz pianist, organist, composer, and singer whose innovations in Harlem stride piano helped shape the course of modern jazz[3][4]. Born in New York City to a Baptist minister father and a musically gifted mother, Waller began playing piano at age six and soon mastered other instruments, including the organ. After his mother's death when he was 14, he moved in with pianist Russell Brooks, who introduced him to stride legend James P. Johnson, a formative influence on his style[2][5]. By age 15, Waller was performing professionally in Harlem theaters and cabarets, quickly gaining a reputation for his technical brilliance and exuberant personality.

Waller's career flourished through the 1920s and 1930s, both as a soloist and with his celebrated small group, Fats Waller and His Rhythm. He was a prolific composer, credited with over 400 songs, including jazz standards like "Ain't Misbehavin'" and "Honeysuckle Rose," both inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame[3][5]. His collaborations with lyricist Andy Razaf produced several Broadway shows and enduring hits. Waller's performances were marked by a unique blend of virtuosic piano, comedic vocals, and showmanship, making him a popular figure on radio, in film, and on international tours. He was also the first prominent jazz organist, adapting his stride techniques to the pipe and Hammond organs[5].

Despite his public success, Waller's life was marked by personal challenges, including financial instability and health issues. He died of pneumonia at age 39 while traveling in Kansas City. Waller's legacy endures through his influential compositions, innovative piano techniques, and the joyful spirit he brought to jazz. His work inspired generations of musicians and remains central to the jazz repertoire[3][5].
