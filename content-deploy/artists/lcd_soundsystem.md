# LCD Soundsystem

## Quick Info
- **Genres**: alternative dance, new rave
- **Spotify Popularity**: 62/100
- **Followers**: 1,254,681
- **Origin**: New York

## Biography
LCD Soundsystem is a New York City–based dance‑punk and alternative dance project formed in Brooklyn in 2002 by musician, producer, and engineer **James Murphy**, co‑founder of the influential DFA Records label.[1][2][3] Murphy had moved to New York in the late 1980s to attend NYU, immersing himself in the city’s DIY music and club scenes while working as a sound engineer for bands like Six Finger Satellite and running his own ‘Death From Above’ studio in Brooklyn, experiences that shaped his hybrid approach to live sound, post‑punk guitars, and club‑oriented electronics.[3] LCD Soundsystem debuted in 2002 with the single “Losing My Edge,” a wry, self‑aware monologue over muscular, minimalist beats that quickly became a cult hit and framed Murphy as a late‑blooming, deeply knowledgeable outsider poking fun at hipster culture.[1][3][5]

The self‑titled debut album *LCD Soundsystem* arrived in 2005, fusing dance‑floor rhythms, punk‑inflected guitars, indie rock songwriting, and sharp, often humorous lyrics, and was followed by the widely acclaimed *Sound of Silver* (2007) and *This Is Happening* (2010), which cemented the band’s reputation as a bridge between indie rock and club culture.[1][2][3][4] In 2011 the group staged a lavish farewell concert at Madison Square Garden and announced a breakup, after which Murphy focused on production, DJing, and film scoring, including work with other prominent artists.[2][4] LCD Soundsystem unexpectedly returned in 2015 with the single “Christmas Will Break Your Heart” and fully reunited for the 2017 album *American Dream*, their first U.S. number‑one record and home to the Grammy‑winning single “tonite.”[1][2][4] After periods of on‑again, off‑again activity, the band continued to tour and record, releasing new material such as the 2024 single “x‑ray eyes” and announcing further work, underscoring their lasting influence on alternative dance and the ongoing dialogue between indie and electronic music.[1][2][4]

Musically, LCD Soundsystem is characterized by a blend of **post‑punk, disco, house, krautrock‑style repetition, and indie rock**, with live drums and guitars sitting alongside sequencers, synths, and detailed studio production.[1][3][4] Murphy’s songs often mix dance‑floor propulsion with introspective or ironic lyrics about aging, subculture, technology, and cultural nostalgia, drawing on his encyclopedic knowledge of underground music while remaining accessible and emotionally direct.[1][3] Critics and historians frequently credit LCD Soundsystem and DFA with helping to re‑establish a two‑way cultural exchange between rock crowds and dance music audiences in the 2000s, influencing the sound and attitude of later indie‑dance, alternative dance, and new rave artists and solidifying the band’s reputation as one of the key acts of their era.[3][4]

## Fun Facts
- The name **LCD Soundsystem** is associated with an early holiday‑season show where Murphy and Pat Mahoney covered songs by the New York band Liquid Liquid; one account expands the abbreviation as “Liquid Christmas Display,” a tongue‑in‑cheek reference to that period.[1]
- Murphy did not release LCD Soundsystem’s breakthrough single “Losing My Edge” until his early thirties, making him an atypically late‑emerging frontman compared with many of his indie‑rock peers.[3]
- Before LCD Soundsystem, Murphy coined the phrase **“Death From Above”** to describe the powerful, detailed PA sound he developed while engineering shows, later using it as the name of both his Brooklyn studio approach and his DFA label.[3]
- The 2017 album *American Dream* gave LCD Soundsystem their first U.S. number‑one chart position, and its track “tonite” won a Grammy Award, a notable feat for a project that began as an underground dance‑punk experiment.[2][4]

## Musical Connections

### Mentors/Influences
- [[six_finger_satellite|Six Finger Satellite]] - Murphy worked as their live sound engineer through the 1990s, learning high‑impact PA techniques and developing the ‘Death From Above’ sound aesthetic that fed directly into LCD Soundsystem and DFA. (Live engineering and touring work with Six Finger Satellite in the 1990s) [early–late 1990s]
- [[liquid_liquid|Liquid Liquid]] - Early LCD Soundsystem shows featured Murphy and drummer Pat Mahoney covering Liquid Liquid songs, and the group’s percussive, minimalist NYC post‑punk funk strongly informed LCD’s rhythmic and sonic palette. (Early live covers of Liquid Liquid material; rhythmic influence on tracks like “Losing My Edge” and other early singles) [early 2000s (influence originating from early‑1980s recordings)]
- [[rites_of_spring|Rites of Spring]] - Murphy has cited bands like Rites of Spring—associated with the intense Revolution Summer scene—as formative examples of music that provoked physical, emotional reaction, influencing LCD’s emphasis on cathartic, physically engaging performances. (General aesthetic and emotional intensity reflected across LCD Soundsystem’s catalog) [influence dating from Murphy’s youth, articulated in interviews in the 2000s–2010s[2]]

### Key Collaborators
- [[pat_mahoney|Pat Mahoney]] - Founding and longtime drummer for LCD Soundsystem, central to the band’s live feel and rhythmic identity on stage and in the studio. (Early singles such as “Losing My Edge,” debut album *LCD Soundsystem*, tours throughout the 2000s and after the 2015 reunion) [2002–2011, 2015–present[1]]
- [[tim_goldsworthy|Tim Goldsworthy]] - Co‑founder of DFA Records with James Murphy; collaborated closely on production, DJ events, and the label’s aesthetic that framed LCD Soundsystem’s early releases. (DFA Records releases including early LCD Soundsystem singles and label‑related production work) [circa 2000–late 2000s[3][4]]
- [[dfa_records_artists_e.g._the_rapture|DFA Records artists (e.g., The Rapture)]] - Murphy, via DFA, co‑produced and helped shape records such as The Rapture’s “House of Jealous Lovers,” part of the same dance‑punk ecosystem that LCD inhabited and cross‑pollinated with. (Production and mixing on DFA‑released singles and albums, including The Rapture’s breakthrough tracks) [early–mid 2000s[4]]

### Artists Influenced
- [[the_broader_dancepunk_and_indiedance_scene_of_the_2000s|The broader dance‑punk and indie‑dance scene of the 2000s]] - Critics credit LCD Soundsystem and DFA with almost single‑handedly restoring a cultural exchange between indie rock audiences and dance music, shaping the sound and ethos of later alternative dance and ‘new rave’ acts. (Impact traceable through the reception of *Sound of Silver*, *This Is Happening*, and DFA releases across the 2000s,[3][4]) [mid‑2000s onward]
- [[subsequent_alternative_dance__electronicleaning_indie_artists|Subsequent alternative dance / electronic‑leaning indie artists]] - LCD’s fusion of post‑punk guitars, disco/house rhythms, and self‑aware lyricism became a reference point for younger bands and producers seeking to bridge rock and club culture. (Influence evident in later indie‑dance albums and DJ culture that cite LCD and DFA as key touchstones) [late 2000s–2010s[3][4]]
