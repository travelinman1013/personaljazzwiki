## Biography
Arsène DeLay is a New Orleans-based singer, songwriter, guitarist, and bandleader, celebrated for her powerful voice and deep connection to the city’s musical heritage[1][3][5]. Born into the Boutté family, renowned for their contributions to jazz and gospel, DeLay was immersed in music from an early age, performing on stage as a child and absorbing the traditions of her community in Tremé, the oldest Black neighborhood in America[4][6][7]. Her artistry was shaped by a rich family lineage and the vibrant cultural landscape of New Orleans, where she developed a style described as 'Soulful Roots Rock,' blending soul, rock, jazz, and gospel influences[3][5].

DeLay’s career spans solo work and collaborations with prominent local bands such as Funk Monkey, The Coven, A2D2, and the Bayou Saints, as well as projects like Blue Basso with bassist Charlie Wooton[1][2]. She has performed at festivals, on television, and in musical theater productions, including 'Nine Lives: A Musical Adaptation Live,' 'Reawakening,' and 'Weather Girl'[1]. Her experiences living and working in Los Angeles and touring internationally have contributed to her resilience and versatility as an artist, while her acting background instilled discipline and a commitment to daily creative practice[3].

Beyond music, DeLay is recognized for her activism and community engagement, notably as program manager for the New Orleans Musicians' Clinic’s Makin’ Groceries initiative, supporting local artists and residents during the pandemic[4]. Her legacy is rooted in both her artistic achievements and her dedication to uplifting her community, continuing the Boutté family tradition of advocacy and cultural preservation[4][7].
