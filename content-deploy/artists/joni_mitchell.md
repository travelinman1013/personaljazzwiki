## Biography
Joni Mitchell, born Roberta Joan Anderson on November 7, 1943, in Fort Macleod, Alberta, Canada, is one of the most influential singer-songwriters of the 20th century. Raised in Saskatchewan, she initially pursued visual art before turning to music, performing in local Canadian folk clubs in the early 1960s. After a brief marriage to folk singer Chuck Mitchell, she moved to the United States, where her unique songwriting, poetic lyrics, and innovative guitar tunings quickly garnered attention in the Greenwich Village folk scene.

Mitchell released her debut album, 'Song to a Seagull,' in 1968, produced by David Crosby. Her early work, including 'Clouds' (1969) and 'Ladies of the Canyon' (1970), established her as a leading voice in folk music, with songs like 'Both Sides, Now' and 'Big Yellow Taxi' achieving widespread acclaim. The 1971 album 'Blue' is considered a landmark in confessional songwriting, praised for its emotional depth and musical sophistication. Throughout the 1970s, Mitchell expanded her sound, blending folk with jazz, pop, and rock influences, collaborating with jazz luminaries such as Jaco Pastorius and Charles Mingus. Her later career saw explorations into electronic and pop music, and she continued to produce, design her own album covers, and advocate for artistic independence.

Mitchell's legacy is profound: she is credited with reshaping the singer-songwriter genre, influencing generations of musicians with her introspective lyrics, open guitar tunings, and genre-defying artistry. She has received numerous accolades, including multiple Grammy Awards and the Kennedy Center Honor, and her work remains a touchstone for artists across genres.
