## Biography
Steve Howell is a fingerpicking guitarist and singer born in Marshall, Texas, who has dedicated over six decades to preserving and reinterpreting early American blues, folk, and jazz traditions.[1][7] His musical awakening occurred in 1965 at age thirteen when he first heard Mississippi John Hurt's fingerpicking country blues style, an experience that fundamentally redirected his musical path away from conventional strumming toward the complex fingerstyle techniques that would define his career.[1][2] This revelation opened a gateway to exploring the rich lineage of acoustic blues masters including Blind Willie McTell, Leadbelly, Robert Johnson, Son House, and Rev. Gary Davis, while simultaneously developing a deep appreciation for how rural blues traditions merged with urban horn-oriented jazz to create the traditional New Orleans sound of the early twentieth century.[1]

## Fun Facts
- Howell served in the US Navy in the early 1970s and was stationed in South Wales, an experience that exposed him to different musical traditions outside his Texas roots.[9]
- He has recorded 13 studio albums as of 2025, with his most recent being 'Yeah Man' released in February 2025, demonstrating remarkable longevity and consistent output over his six-decade career.[1][3]
- Howell's creative philosophy emphasizes delivering songs 'honestly and musically' while allowing the tunes themselves to reveal their timeless value, reflecting his deep reverence for traditional material rather than ego-driven reinterpretation.[1]
- He recorded four tracks for the 'Yeah Man' album in Santa Fe, New Mexico, representing a departure from his usual recording routine and adding geographic diversity to his production process.[1]
