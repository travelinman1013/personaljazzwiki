## Biography
Gwendolyn Elizabeth Brooks (June 7, 1917 – December 3, 2000) was an acclaimed American poet, author, and teacher, best known as the first African American to win the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry in 1950 for her collection 'Annie Allen.' Born in Topeka, Kansas, Brooks moved to Chicago as an infant, where she spent her formative years and much of her life. Her early experiences with racial prejudice and the vibrant life of Chicago’s South Side deeply influenced her writing, which she began publishing as a teenager. By age sixteen, Brooks had published over 75 poems, and her first collection, 'A Street in Bronzeville' (1945), brought her national attention.

Brooks’s poetic style evolved throughout her career, blending traditional forms like sonnets and ballads with free verse and the rhythms of jazz and blues. Her work often explored the lives, struggles, and celebrations of ordinary people in her community, with a particular focus on Black urban life. In the 1960s, after attending the Second Black Writers’ Conference at Fisk University, Brooks’s poetry became more politically engaged, reflecting themes of race, class, and social justice. She published more than 20 books, including the influential 'The Bean Eaters' (1960), which contains the iconic poem 'We Real Cool.'

Beyond her writing, Brooks was a dedicated teacher and mentor, holding positions at several universities and working with young writers in Chicago. She served as Poet Laureate of Illinois from 1968 until her death and was the U.S. Poet Laureate for 1985–86. Brooks’s legacy endures as one of the most influential American poets of the 20th century, celebrated for her technical mastery, social insight, and commitment to nurturing future generations of writers.
