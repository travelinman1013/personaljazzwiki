## Biography
Emily Fennell, known professionally as Miss Emily, is a Canadian blues and soul singer-songwriter based in Kingston, Ontario. Born in Prince Edward County, Ontario, she began her musical journey as a pre-teen, winning accolades at county fairs throughout Southern Ontario. Inspired by soul legends Ray Charles and Aretha Franklin, with K.D. Lang as her benchmark, Miss Emily honed her craft performing in juke joints, nightclubs, and bars across Ontario's backroads and highways. At just 23 years old, she became a full-time musician while raising her daughter Piper as a single mother, a decision supported by the Kingston community that would become central to her identity and career.

Miss Emily's professional breakthrough came through her residency at The Merchant in Kingston, where she performed every Friday night, gradually transitioning from cover songs to predominantly original material. Her powerful, soul-drenched vocals and electrifying live performances earned her national recognition, culminating in a 2022 JUNO Award nomination for Blues Album of the Year for her album 'Miss Emily LIVE at the Isabel,' a 15-track compilation of live performances recorded at Kingston's Isabel Bader Centre for the Performing Arts, where she holds the record for most sold-out performances. Her career has been marked by fearless songwriting that addresses personal struggles including domestic violence, single motherhood, and resilience, themes that resonate deeply with audiences and critics who have compared her to Aretha Franklin and Amy Winehouse.

Throughout her two-decade career, Miss Emily has released five albums and earned multiple accolades including three Female Vocalist of the Year awards at the Canadian Blues Awards (Maple Blues Awards 2019, 2021, 2023), New Artist of the Year, and a Sapphire Canadian Blues Music Video Award. Her artistic philosophy centers on community, vulnerability, and the belief that great risks yield greater rewards. She credits her success not solely to talent but to positive attitude, smart business decisions, personal connections, and an unwavering work ethic forged in Southern Ontario's music venues. Her recent work blends soul, blues, and roots music, featuring collaborations with accomplished musicians and showcasing her commitment to creating music that heals and uplifts rather than diminishes.
