## Biography
Pieta Brown, born in 1973 in Iowa City, Iowa, is an acclaimed American singer-songwriter, producer, and multi-instrumentalist known for her evocative blend of folk, Americana, and indie influences. Raised in a rural Iowa home without running water or heat, Brown was immersed in traditional and rural folk music from an early age, largely through her father, renowned folk artist Greg Brown. After her parents separated, she moved frequently between Iowa and Alabama, experiences that shaped her poetic sensibility and musical voice. She began writing poetry and composing on piano as a child, later teaching herself guitar in her early twenties and quickly gravitating toward live performance and recording[1][5][6].

Brown's career began in earnest with her self-titled debut in 2002, co-produced with Bo Ramsey, which garnered critical praise for its haunting, blues-rooted sound. Over the next two decades, she released a series of acclaimed albums including 'In The Cool' (2005), 'Remember The Sun' (2007), 'Mercury' (2011), and 'Paradise Outlaw' (2014), the latter recorded at Justin Vernon's April Base Studio and hailed as a career highlight. Her innovative 2017 album 'Postcards' featured remote collaborations with artists like Mark Knopfler and Calexico, reflecting her commitment to creative connection. Brown's music is noted for its lyrical depth, atmospheric arrangements, and her ability to bridge Americana traditions with modern indie sensibilities[1][3][5].

Throughout her career, Pieta Brown has toured internationally and collaborated with a diverse array of artists, earning recognition as one of Americana's most distinctive voices. Her work is celebrated for its poetic lyricism, emotional honesty, and the subtle power of her performances, establishing her as a respected figure in contemporary roots music[3][4].
