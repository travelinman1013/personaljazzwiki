## Biography
Ray Charles and Willie Nelson were two legendary American musicians whose paths crossed in powerful collaborations, most notably the 1984 duet 'Seven Spanish Angels,' blending country, soul, and blues elements. Ray Charles, born in Albany, Georgia in 1930, pioneered the fusion of gospel, blues, R&B, and country, notably with his 1962 album Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music, while Willie Nelson, born in Abbott, Texas in 1933, became a cornerstone of outlaw country with his songwriting and genre-defying style. Their partnership highlighted mutual respect, with Nelson often citing Charles as a profound influence, leading to live performances and recordings that crossed musical boundaries.[1][2][3]
