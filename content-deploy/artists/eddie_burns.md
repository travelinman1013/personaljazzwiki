## Biography
Eddie "Guitar" Burns was born on February 8, 1928, in Belzoni, Mississippi, and was raised primarily by his grandparents around Clarksdale. His father was a sharecropper and a traveling medicine show singer, exposing Burns to music from an early age. He left Mississippi permanently around 1946, working for the Illinois Central Railroad before settling in Detroit in 1948. There, he began his musical journey with gospel groups and quickly became a fixture in the Detroit blues scene, performing at clubs like the Harlem Inn and the Tavern Lounge. Burns was mentored by John Lee Hooker and played harmonica and guitar, eventually recording his own singles and becoming known for his lean, countrified blues style. Over the decades, Burns adapted to changing musical trends, recording for labels such as Checker, Chess, and Harvey Records, and later gaining wider recognition through European tours and appearances at major festivals like the Ann Arbor Blues and Jazz Festival. His career spanned seven decades, and he remained active well into the 21st century, releasing albums such as 'Snake Eyes' in 2002, which featured his brother Jimmy Burns on guitar. Burns is widely regarded as one of the most important Detroit bluesmen, second only to John Lee Hooker in stature.
