## Biography
Thee Sacred Souls are a retro soul band formed in San Diego, California, in 2019 by bassist Salvador Samano, drummer/guitarist Alex Garcia, and vocalist Josh Lane. The trio first connected through the Southern California music scene, with Samano and Garcia meeting at a local show and bonding over a shared love of classic soul, Chicano soul, and the Westside Sound. Lane, who had studied classical voice and performed in Sacramento before relocating to San Diego, joined after connecting with Garcia via social media. Their early collaborations took place in garages and home studios, where they recorded rough demos that captured the essence of 1960s and 1970s soul, R&B, and doo-wop, but with a modern sensibility.

The band's breakthrough came when their demos caught the attention of Gabriel Roth (aka Bosco Mann), co-founder of Daptone Records, who saw them perform at just their second live show and quickly signed them to Penrose Records, Daptone's Southern California imprint. Their debut single, “Can I Call You Rose?”, released in March 2022, became a viral hit, amassing millions of streams and establishing their reputation for heartfelt, vintage-inspired songwriting. Their self-titled debut album followed, earning critical acclaim and a devoted global following. Thee Sacred Souls have since toured extensively across North America and Europe, sharing stages with acts like St. Paul and The Broken Bones and performing at major festivals such as Newport Folk Festival and Lollapalooza. Their sophomore album, 'Got a Story to Tell,' released in October 2024, reflects a maturing sound, incorporating elements of Jamaican rocksteady and girl group harmonies while maintaining their signature soulful warmth.

Musically, Thee Sacred Souls draw deeply from the well of classic soul, referencing artists like Brenton Wood, The Delfonics, Thee Midniters, and Marvin Gaye, as well as the broader traditions of Motown, doo-wop, and Brill Building pop. Their music resonates with a sense of nostalgia yet feels fresh and contemporary, earning them praise as heirs to a timeless tradition. In just a few years, they have become a leading voice in the modern soul revival, celebrated for their craftsmanship, emotional honesty, and ability to connect with audiences across generations.
