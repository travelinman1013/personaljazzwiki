## Biography
Jesse Davis Brock, born on July 18, 1972, in Decatur, Illinois, began his bluegrass career at age nine with his family band, the CW Brock Family, immersing himself in the genre from an early age. Over a career spanning more than 40 years, he developed into a master mandolin player and vocalist, performing with prominent acts including the Lynn Morris Band, Chris Jones & the Nightdrivers, Audie Blaylock and Redline, The Gibson Brothers and Fast Track, and Michael Cleveland & Flamekeeper. His traditional bluegrass style features pure, upbeat mandolin picking on both originals and standards, earning him individual IBMA Mandolin Player of the Year awards in 2009, 2015, and 2024.[2][1][3]

Brock released his debut solo album *Kickin’ Grass* in 2002 on Pinecastle Records, featuring top musicians like Jason Moore, Ron Stewart, and Rob Ickes, which was nominated for an IBMA award. His second solo album, *Streamliner*, came out in July 2021 on Sound Biscuit, preceded by singles like 'Kiss On A Cold, Cold Stone' and 'Black Rock City.' Since 2022, he has been a key member of Authentic Unlimited, contributing to their debut on Billy Blue Records, Grand Ole Opry appearance in 2023, and multiple 2023-2024 IBMA awards including Vocal Group of the Year and Song of the Year for 'Fall in Tennessee.'[2][1]

Residing in Franklin, Tennessee, with his wife Kristine, Brock previously made his home in Maine when not touring. His legacy includes nine IBMA group awards with bands he played in, and his solos have been transcribed in a book by Nick DiSebastian for aspiring mandolinists, solidifying his influence in bluegrass mandolin playing.[2][3]
