## Biography
Dana and Alden is an indie jazz duo formed by brothers Dana and Alden McWayne, originally from Eugene, Oregon. Raised in a musically rich environment, the siblings were introduced to jazz by their father, who exposed them to legends like Pharoah Sanders and John Coltrane and encouraged their exploration of the local library’s music collection. Their earliest musical experiences came from participating in Sunday jazz jams run by local legend Kenny Reed, who mentored them and eventually invited them to join his band, Stone Cold Jazz, playing gigs around town several nights a week[3][8].

Dana, the elder, is a saxophonist and organic farm inspector based in Durham, NC, while Alden, the younger, is a drummer and a graduate of Berklee College of Music[2][4][7]. Their sound is rooted in jazz but draws from an eclectic mix of genres—including indie, pop, rap, funk, and psychedelia—reflecting their omnivorous musical upbringing. Their discography includes the EP 'Brothers' (2021), 'Quiet Music For Young People' (2023), 'Coyote, You’re My Star' (2024), and their major-label debut 'Speedo' (2024) for Concord Jazz, recorded in Lisbon with producer Charif Megarbane[1]. The duo’s rise has been fueled by grassroots support and viral TikTok videos, where their playful covers and comedic personas have resonated with Gen-Z audiences[3][9].

Now based in Brooklyn, Dana and Alden continue to expand their sound and influence, performing with a rotating cast of talented musicians and opening for acts like Benny Sings and The Yussef Dayes Experience. Their work is characterized by genre fluidity, emotional depth, and a commitment to reimagining jazz for younger generations, blending formal training and lived experience into a vibrant, ever-evolving musical legacy[1][3].
