## Biography
Eddie Palmieri, born December 15, 1936, in Spanish Harlem, New York City, is a foundational figure in Latin jazz and salsa. The son of Puerto Rican immigrants, Palmieri was raised in a musically rich environment and began piano lessons at age eight, inspired by his older brother, the acclaimed pianist Charlie Palmieri. By his early teens, Eddie was already performing professionally, joining his uncle’s orchestra at thirteen and later playing with several prominent Latin bands in New York during the 1950s.

In 1961, Palmieri founded La Perfecta, a groundbreaking ensemble that revolutionized Latin music by featuring trombones instead of the traditional trumpets, creating a bold, brassy sound that became his signature. His innovative approach blended Afro-Caribbean rhythms with jazz improvisation and Puerto Rican folk influences, helping to define and popularize salsa and Latin jazz. Landmark recordings such as "Azúcar Pa' Ti" and "Vamonos Pa'l Monte" became genre classics, and his 1975 album "The Sun of Latin Music" earned him the first-ever Grammy Award for Best Latin Recording. Over a career spanning more than six decades, Palmieri garnered ten Grammy Awards and was celebrated for his relentless creativity and technical mastery.

Palmieri’s legacy extends far beyond his recordings and performances. He is credited with elevating salsa to a global art form, mentoring younger musicians, and advocating for the recognition of Latin jazz within the broader music industry. His influence is felt across generations, and his pioneering spirit continues to inspire artists worldwide.
