## Biography
Sudan Archives, born Brittney Denise Parks in Cincinnati, Ohio, is an American violinist, singer, songwriter, and producer acclaimed for her innovative blend of alternative R&B, indie soul, and experimental electronic music[2][1]. Self-taught on the violin from a young age, Parks was inspired by the unique styles of Northeast African fiddlers, which led her to fuse traditional folk sounds with contemporary beats and electronic production[1][2]. Her early musical experiences included forming a pop duo with her twin sister under the encouragement of her stepfather, who worked at LaFace Records, but she ultimately pursued a solo path to nurture her creativity[2].

At age nineteen, Parks moved to Los Angeles to study ethnomusicology at Pasadena City College, immersing herself in the city's vibrant experimental music scene and club nights like Low End Theory[2][4]. Signed to Stones Throw Records in 2017, she quickly garnered attention with her debut EPs, "Sudan Archives" and "Sink," followed by critically acclaimed albums such as "Athena" (2019), "Natural Brown Prom Queen" (2022), and "The BPM" (2025)[2][1]. Her music is characterized by its post-genre fluidity, combining violin improvisations, soulful vocals, and influences ranging from African rhythms to hip-hop, funk, and electronic music[3][4].

Sudan Archives has been recognized as a boundary-defying innovator in modern R&B, earning two Libera Awards in 2023 for Best Breakthrough Artist/Release and Best R&B Record[2]. Her legacy lies in her dedication to showcasing the "Blackness of the violin," challenging Western classical norms, and inspiring a new generation of artists to embrace genre-bending creativity and self-expression[2][4].
