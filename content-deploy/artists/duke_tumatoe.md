## Biography
William “Bill” Severen Fiorio, known as Duke Tumatoe, was born in Chicago in June 1947 to a first-generation Italian family. Growing up on the city's South Side, the birthplace of urban electric blues, he was immersed in the genre from a young age, frequently visiting the Maxwell Street Market to hear legends like Muddy Waters, whom he first saw at age 13. A self-taught musician, he began playing drums at 14 and guitar soon after, learning by observing Chicago blues masters. His style blends intense blues guitar—described as 'B.B. King played through Jimi Hendrix (with a touch of Andy Gill)'—with humorous, twist-filled lyrics that turn life's hardships into light-hearted stories.[1][2][3]

In 1965, Tumatoe enrolled at the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana, where he briefly led the psychedelic rock group Lothar and The Hand People, notable for their innovative use of the theremin in tracks like 'Space Hymn.' By 1967, he co-founded REO Speedwagon as a soul-influenced band, but left in 1969 when it shifted to straight rock, preferring blues. That year, he formed Duke Tumatoe and The All-Star Frogs, featuring keyboardist James Mitchell Hill (compared to Booker T. Jones), touring for 13 years and releasing three or four albums. In 1983, after moving to Indianapolis, he disbanded the Frogs and launched Duke Tumatoe and The Power Trio, which has released 12-13 albums and maintained a grueling schedule of over 200 shows annually for decades.[1][2][3]

Tumatoe has shared stages with icons like Muddy Waters, Bo Diddley, B.B. King, Willie Dixon, Buddy Guy, John Fogerty, and George Thorogood. His 1988 live album *I Like My Job*, produced by Fogerty, highlights his enduring career. Known for 15 albums as bandleader and a humorous take on blues, he continues performing over 100 dates yearly, cementing his legacy as a Midwest blues entertainer.[1][2]
