## Biography
Lars Ivar Edegran, born in Stockholm, Sweden, in 1944, grew up in a musical family immersed in American blues and jazz from an early age. He began playing in New Orleans-style jazz groups as a teenager, forming a band with fellow Swede Örjan 'Orange' Kellin at age 17 and releasing three EPs together. After studying at the Juilliard School of Music in New York for two years, he moved to the U.S. on a green card to work at Delmark Records in Chicago, where he encountered blues legends like Buddy Guy, before hitchhiking to New Orleans in 1965, arriving the day after Hurricane Betsy.[1][2][3][5]

On his first day in New Orleans, Edegran visited Preservation Hall, was invited to play by founder Allan Jaffe, and quickly became a regular, joining the black musicians' union and performing with veterans at the venue and Luthjen’s Dance Hall. A multi-instrumentalist proficient on piano, guitar, banjo, mandolin, clarinet, and saxophone, he founded the New Orleans Ragtime Orchestra with Orange Kellin, arranging music including tuba parts for bassist Allan Jaffe, and later led iterations like the Palm Court Jazz Band at the Palm Court Jazz Cafe in the French Quarter. His career highlights include theatrical arrangements for the revue 'One Mo’ Time,' the Academy Award-nominated soundtrack for the 1978 film 'Pretty Baby,' extensive touring with Preservation Hall Jazz Band (including the White House and Newport Jazz Festival), and producing GHB Records, a key label for New Orleans jazz reissues.[1][2][3][4]

Edegran's style is rooted in Dixieland, ragtime, and traditional New Orleans jazz, blending European enthusiasm with authentic local sounds. He has performed regularly for decades, received a 2010 Preservation Resource Center award for his contributions to jazz heritage, and continues as a cultural ambassador, honored by Preservation Hall's Legacy Awards in recent years.[2][3]
