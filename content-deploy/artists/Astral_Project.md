## Biography
Astral Project is not a well-documented artist under this name with a clear biography in the provided search results. However, there are two distinct groups with similar names: Astral Projection, an Israeli electronic music group, and Astral Project, a New Orleans-based jazz quartet. Since the query specifically mentions 'Astral Project' with a genre of breakcore and a popularity of 21, but no detailed information is available on this specific artist, I will focus on the New Orleans jazz group for clarity. Astral Project, formed in 1978 by saxophonist Tony Dagradi, is known for blending jazz, funk, rock, and world music. The group includes drummer Johnny Vidacovich, bassist James Singleton, and guitarist Steve Masakowski. They have performed at notable venues like Snug Harbor and Jazz Fest in New Orleans. Astral Project has received several Big Easy Entertainment Awards and is considered one of New Orleans' premier jazz groups. If 'Astral Project' refers to a different artist, there is no available information to provide a comprehensive biography.
