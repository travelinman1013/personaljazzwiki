## Biography
Huey "Piano" Smith & the Clowns were a seminal New Orleans R&B and early rock and roll group built around pianist, songwriter, and bandleader Huey "Piano" Smith, born January 26, 1934, in the Central City neighborhood of New Orleans, Louisiana.[2][1] Smith grew up immersed in the city’s rich piano tradition, writing his first tune, "Robertson Street Boogie," at age eight and playing in clubs by his mid-teens.[2] Deeply influenced by Professor Longhair’s rolling, syncopated style, he developed a distinctive shuffling right-hand piano break that became a hallmark of New Orleans R&B and influenced many Southern players.[2] As a teenager he worked as a session pianist, backing leading local figures like Guitar Slim (Eddie Jones), Earl King, Lloyd Price, Smiley Lewis, and Little Richard on key 1950s recordings, which helped shape his feel for danceable, good‑humored R&B.[2][1]

In 1957 Smith formed his own group, **Huey "Piano" Smith and His Clowns**, with vocalist Bobby Marchan and signed a long‑term deal with Ace Records under producer Johnny Vincent.[2][1] The Clowns specialized in high‑energy party records built around Smith’s rolling piano, comic call‑and‑response vocals, and a loose, street‑corner ensemble sound. Their breakthrough came with "Rockin' Pneumonia and the Boogie Woogie Flu" (1957), a Top Five R&B hit that became an enduring rock and roll standard, followed by the 1958 double‑sided smash "Don't You Just Know It" / "High Blood Pressure," which reached the pop Top 10 and R&B Top Five.[1][3] Although Smith wrote and recorded "Sea Cruise" in 1959, Ace Records replaced his vocal with that of white teen singer Frankie Ford for the commercial single, giving Ford the national hit while Smith’s band provided the backing track.[1][3] Over the next few years the Clowns’ lineup shifted—Marchan eventually departed after solo success and was replaced by singers such as Gerri Hall and Curley Moore—while Smith tried further novelty hits and briefly recorded for labels including Imperial and Instant.[1][2]

Smith continued to perform through the 1960s under several names—Huey "Piano" Smith and His Clowns, the Hueys, the Pitter Pats, and Shindig Smith and the Soul Shakers—but never recaptured his late‑1950s chart heights.[2][1] By the 1970s he largely withdrew from the music business, focusing on his faith as a Jehovah’s Witness, though he made select comebacks, including a 1971 remake of "Rockin' Pneumonia" and appearances with a re‑formed Clowns lineup at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival and Tipitina’s in 1979 and 1981.[2][3] Despite inconsistent commercial recognition and disputes over credit and royalties, Smith & the Clowns left a lasting legacy: their joyous, piano‑driven New Orleans R&B sound and comic "Clowns" concept influenced generations of rock and R&B artists, and "Rockin' Pneumonia and the Boogie Woogie Flu" and "Don't You Just Know It" remain staples of the early rock canon, repeatedly covered and celebrated as foundational party records.[3][5]

## Fun Facts
- Huey Smith wrote his first song, "Robertson Street Boogie," at just eight years old, naming it after the New Orleans street where he lived and performing it as part of a duo called Slick and Doc.[2]
- The vocals on the classic hit "Sea Cruise" are not by Huey Smith—although he wrote the song and his band cut the original track, Ace Records had white teen singer Frankie Ford overdub his vocal onto Smith’s backing, and Ford received the hit.[1][3]
- One of the Clowns’ early vocalists, Bobby Marchan, was a well‑known female impersonator and drag performer, giving the group’s live show a flamboyant, vaudeville‑like edge that matched their name.[1][5]
- Future cult comedy star Rudy Ray Moore (later famous as Dolemite) once worked as the Clowns’ driver during their touring years, linking the band indirectly to 1970s blaxploitation film culture.[5]
