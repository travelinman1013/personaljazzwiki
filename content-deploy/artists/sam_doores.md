## Biography
Sam Doores is an American singer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist best known for his work at the crossroads of Americana, alt‑country, folk, and New Orleans rhythm-and-blues. Born in the San Francisco Bay Area and coming of age as a teenage troubadour busking around the United States, he eventually made a life‑changing trip to New Orleans in the mid‑2000s, drawn by the city’s deep musical traditions and post‑Katrina energy. In New Orleans he secured a regular gig at an Irish pub, immersed himself in local street‑level music culture, and began developing a songwriting voice that blended classic country, folk storytelling, and the syncopated feel of the city’s brass bands and Mardi Gras Indian traditions.

Doores first came to wider attention through his close association with Alynda Segarra and Hurray for the Riff Raff, contributing guitar, vocals, and songwriting to a string of records that linked old‑time Americana with socially conscious themes. He also co‑founded his own band in New Orleans’ Lower Ninth Ward, initially known as Sam Doores + Riley Downing & The Tumbleweeds and later as The Deslondes, whose 2012 album “Holy Cross Blues” and subsequent releases earned praise for reviving honky‑tonk, country‑soul, and swamp‑pop sounds with a modern edge. As a collaborator, sideman, and bandleader he toured extensively in North America and Europe, helped run a small home‑grown label devoted to friends’ recordings, and built a reputation for fostering collective, community‑based music making.

In 2020 Doores released his self‑titled solo debut, recorded over several years between New Orleans, Nashville, and Berlin, where he worked closely with producer Anders Christopherson and a rotating cast of international players. The album weaves in influences ranging from Tin Pan Alley songcraft and Mississippi hill‑country blues to Cambodian rock, French Quarter jazz, and psychedelic folk‑rock, reflecting both his years in New Orleans and his experiences abroad. While still a relatively young artist, his body of work with Hurray for the Riff Raff, The Deslondes, and his solo material has made him an influential figure in contemporary Americana circles, noted for bridging traditional roots music with experimental production and for nurturing collaborative scenes that extend beyond his own records.

## Fun Facts
- He first connected with New Orleans by hitchhiking toward the city as a teenager, detouring to Austin when Hurricane Katrina hit, then being persuaded by displaced New Orleans musicians to visit Jazz Fest, which convinced him to relocate.
- His early New Orleans break came when an Irish pub owner spotted him busking on Bourbon Street and offered him a steady gig, giving him a regular stage and income in the city.
- The street where he lived in the Holy Cross neighborhood inspired both the name of The Deslondes and a years‑long house scene where friends gathered to play, cook, and record, eventually spawning a small DIY label.
- Portions of his solo debut were tracked in Berlin with a producer who initially reached out by email, leading to recurring sessions where a house band included a Spanish keyboardist coincidentally named Carlos Santana.
