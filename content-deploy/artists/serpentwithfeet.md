## Biography
serpentwithfeet, born Josiah Wise in Baltimore, Maryland, is an American singer-songwriter known for his innovative blend of alternative R&B, gospel, classical, and avant-garde pop. Raised in a deeply religious household with both parents as clergy, Wise’s earliest musical experiences were rooted in the church, where he began singing in the choir and dancing during services from the age of five. His mother encouraged his formal vocal training, enrolling him in the Maryland State Boys Choir at age eleven, despite his initial reluctance. This early exposure to classical music, combined with his gospel background, shaped his unique vocal style and musical sensibility.[1][3][4]

Wise attended Baltimore City College, a magnet school with a renowned choir, where he further honed his craft and traveled internationally for competitions. He later studied classical music at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia, but found the classical world limiting for Black voices. After moving to New York, he immersed himself in the city’s vibrant music scene, working various jobs while developing his artistic identity. In 2016, he released his debut EP 'blisters,' produced by The Haxan Cloak, which drew critical acclaim for its haunting fusion of genres. His first full-length album, 'soil' (2018), and its follow-up, 'Deacon' (2021), further established him as a singular voice exploring themes of Black queer love, spirituality, and vulnerability through lush, genre-defying soundscapes.[1][2][3][4]

serpentwithfeet’s legacy lies in his ability to craft deeply personal, emotionally resonant music that challenges traditional boundaries of R&B and pop. His work is celebrated for its theatricality, intricate vocal arrangements, and unapologetic embrace of queer identity, making him a trailblazer in contemporary alternative music.[2][4]
