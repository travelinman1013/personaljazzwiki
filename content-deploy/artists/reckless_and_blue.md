## Biography
Reckless And Blue is a Denver, Colorado–based **blues and blues‑rock band** formed by guitarist, vocalist, and songwriter **George Williams** after he returned to the Denver area in 2017 following three decades of travel, study, and performing.[1][3] Williams had honed his craft as a classical guitar student, band member, and singer‑songwriter, and set out to build a group of seasoned musicians dedicated to presenting both classic and contemporary blues with energy and authenticity.[1][3] The lineup coalesced into a five‑piece ensemble featuring Williams on vocals and guitar, **Shaunda Fry** on vocals, **Steve Gaskin** on drums, **Dutch Smith** on bass, and **Allen Anderson** on keyboards, quickly becoming a fixture on the Front Range live‑music circuit from Fort Collins to Colorado Springs.[1][5]

Musically, Reckless And Blue draw on more than a century of blues tradition, with acknowledged influences ranging from **Howlin’ Wolf** to **Samantha Fish** and beyond.[1] Their sound has been described as **classic blues with a modern twist**, blending traditional grooves with roots‑rock, jazz, and R&B colors while emphasizing danceable rhythms and soulful vocals.[1][5] The band released its debut album, *Can’t Give Me the Blues*, in December 2021, earning independent‑radio airplay and laying the groundwork for broader exposure.[1][2][3] They followed this with the full‑length album *Seven Deadly Gins* (independent), produced after several years of steady gigging and studio work; the record arrived in late 2025 and showcases ten original songs that highlight the group’s songwriting and tight ensemble interplay.[2][3][7]

Since their formation, Reckless And Blue have steadily built a regional reputation, including runner‑up placements in both the **2023 Mile High Blues Society Road to Memphis Blues Challenge** and the **2024 Colorado Blues Society Road to Memphis Blues Challenge**, before ultimately winning the Colorado Blues Society Blues Challenge and earning a berth at the International Blues Challenge in Memphis.[1][2] Their growing profile has extended overseas through airplay and a regular “Reckless Blues” radio show on **Radio Wigwam**, broadcast from Cardiff, Wales, which helped pave the way for a planned **U.K. tour** in 2026 in support of *Seven Deadly Gins*.[2] While still an emerging act on the global scene, the band has begun to carve out a legacy as an energetic, road‑tested Denver blues outfit that bridges traditional and modern blues for festival and club audiences alike.[1][2][3][7]
