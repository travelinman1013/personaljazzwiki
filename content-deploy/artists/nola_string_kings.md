## Biography
The NOLA String Kings are a contemporary jazz string trio based in New Orleans, Louisiana, known for their inventive arrangements and dedication to the city’s rich musical traditions. The group consists of John Rankin (guitar), Matt Rhody (violin, mandolin), and Don Vappie (guitar, banjo), all of whom are established musicians with deep roots in the New Orleans scene[3][4]. Their music draws from the legacy of early New Orleans string bands, blending jazz, Creole, Latin, and folk influences into a sound that is both historically informed and refreshingly modern[3]. The trio’s approach emphasizes collective improvisation, with multiple melodic lines weaving together in the spirit of classic New Orleans jazz[3]. Their album 'Dream Palace' showcases original compositions alongside reinterpretations of standards, highlighting their technical prowess and playful, communal spirit[3]. While the NOLA String Kings are a relatively recent ensemble, their members’ individual careers span decades, and the group itself has become a respected part of the city’s live music landscape, performing at venues and festivals that celebrate New Orleans’ musical heritage[4].
