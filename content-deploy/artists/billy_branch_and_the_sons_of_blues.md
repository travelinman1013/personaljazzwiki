## Biography
Billy Branch & The Sons of Blues is the long‑running Chicago band led by Grammy‑nominated harmonica player, singer, and educator **Billy Branch**, one of the central figures in the post‑1970s Chicago blues scene.[1][5] Born in Chicago and raised in Los Angeles, Branch returned to Chicago at 17 to attend the University of Illinois, where he earned a degree in political science and only discovered the blues around age 18.[1][5] Immersing himself in the city’s clubs, he rapidly became known as a fiery young harmonica player and, after apprenticing with major elders, emerged as a bridge between the classic postwar generation and newer players.

In the mid‑1970s Branch began working with legendary bassist, songwriter, and producer Willie Dixon, touring as Dixon’s harmonica player and absorbing both the musical language and the broader cultural significance of the blues.[1] By 1977 he founded his own band, **The Sons of Blues**, conceived as a group of younger musicians carrying forward the Chicago tradition while giving it a contemporary voice; over the ensuing decades he recorded roughly 15 albums under that banner and appeared as a featured sideman on hundreds more.[1][2] The Sons of Blues became a flexible but stable unit rooted in Chicago, with a modern, groove‑conscious sound that fused classic Chicago shuffles and slow blues with soul, funk, and socially aware lyrics.[1][3] Branch also launched a long‑running "Blues in the Schools" program beginning in 1979, emphasizing both performance and education, and over time he earned induction into the Blues Hall of Fame along with numerous awards recognizing his role as a 21st‑century standard‑bearer for Chicago blues.[1]

Musically, Branch & The Sons of Blues are noted for Branch’s thick, expressive harmonica tone, his soulful, conversational vocals, and arrangements that place traditional blues language in a polished, contemporary setting with horns, electric guitar, and piano.[1][3] The group’s 2025 album **“The Blues Is My Biography”** exemplifies this approach, mixing shuffles, ballads, and socially conscious songs like "Begging for Change" with collaborations featuring Bobby Rush and Shemekia Copeland.[1][3] Across their body of work the band has balanced club‑tested Chicago blues grit with a modern, radio‑friendly sheen, helping to bring the genre to new audiences while explicitly honoring the elders whose music shaped the sound of Chicago.

## Fun Facts
- Billy Branch did not seriously hear or play blues music until he was about 18 years old, despite being born in Chicago; he initially planned to become a lawyer and studied political science at the University of Illinois before the blues changed his career path.[1][5]
- When Willie Dixon hired Branch to tour with him, Branch had to step into the role previously held by top‑tier harmonica player Carey Bell, forcing him to rapidly raise his level; Dixon later commented that after touring, Branch’s playing had improved so much he was almost unrecognizable musically.[1]
- Branch’s commitment to education is so deep that he has been running Blues in the Schools programs continuously since 1979, bringing live blues and its history into classrooms for more than four decades.[1]
- The 2025 album “The Blues Is My Biography” was released on Rosa’s Lounge Records, a label formed by the owners of the famed Chicago club Rosa’s Lounge, where Branch played at the venue’s grand opening more than 40 years earlier.[1]
