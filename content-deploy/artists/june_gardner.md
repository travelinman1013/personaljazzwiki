## Biography
Albert "June" Gardner, also known as "Gentleman June," was born on December 31, 1930, in New Orleans, Louisiana. He launched his professional music career immediately after high school, first touring with R&B vocalist Lil Green. Gardner quickly became a fixture in the vibrant New Orleans music scene, performing at the legendary Dew Drop Inn with Edgar Blanchard & the Gondoliers, and establishing himself as a versatile and reliable drummer in both jazz and rhythm & blues circles.

Gardner's career reached national prominence when he spent nine years performing and recording with Roy "Good Rockin' Tonight" Brown, and later as the drummer for soul legend Sam Cooke from 1960 until Cooke's death in 1964. He played on Cooke's iconic live albums, including "At the Copa" and "Live at the Harlem Square Club." Gardner's drumming can also be heard on Lee Dorsey's hit "Working in a Coal Mine" and he was a regular member of Dave Bartholomew's band. After returning to New Orleans, Gardner led his own sessions, notably releasing the single "99 Plus One"/"Mustard Greens," and anchored his own traditional jazz band, The Fellas, performing at venues like Bourbon Street and the New Orleans JazzFest.

Known for his groove versatility and ability to adapt to various styles, Gardner was respected by peers and audiences alike. His legacy endures as one of the Crescent City's great drummers, having contributed to the sound of numerous R&B and jazz recordings and influenced generations of musicians through his work both on stage and in the studio.
