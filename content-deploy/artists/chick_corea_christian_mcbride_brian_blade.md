# Chick Corea Christian McBride Brian Blade

## Biography
Chick Corea Trilogy refers to the acclaimed jazz trio featuring pianist Chick Corea, bassist Christian McBride, and drummer Brian Blade, which formed after their collaboration in Corea's Five Peace Band with John McLaughlin. The group debuted around 2010 at the Ottawa Jazz Festival and released their first live triple-CD album, Trilogy, in 2013, earning two Grammy Awards: Best Jazz Instrumental Album and Best Improvised Jazz Solo for Corea's 'Fingerprints.'[1][2][7] The trio's chemistry stemmed from Corea's vision of a cooperative acoustic ensemble emphasizing virtuosic interplay, modern post-bop, and fusion elements, with live recordings captured worldwide.[3][4]

Christian McBride, born in 1972 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, began on electric bass at age nine and acoustic bass at 11, influenced by his bassist father Lee Smith; he studied classical and jazz at Philadelphia High School for Creative and Performing Arts and briefly at Juilliard before turning professional with Bobby Watson’s Horizon, Roy Hargrove, Freddie Hubbard, Ray Brown’s Super Bass Trio, and Pat Metheny’s Special Quartet by age 20.[3][5] Brian Blade, born in 1970 in Shreveport, Louisiana, was raised in a Baptist church with gospel music, studied in New Orleans, and formed his Fellowship Band in 1997 while working with Wayne Shorter’s quartet and artists like Joni Mitchell and Bill Frisell.[3][5] Chick Corea (1941-2021), an NEA Jazz Master with 23 Grammys, pioneered fusion with Miles Davis on Bitches Brew, led Return to Forever, Circle, and Elektric Band, and explored Latin and acoustic jazz.[3]

The trio's musical style blended Corea's expansive piano innovations with McBride's powerhouse bass and Blade's masterful drumming, creating effusive live performances documented in Trilogy 2 (from world tours) and Triology 3 (final 2020 European tour).[4][9][10] Their legacy includes multiple Grammy wins, celebrated rapport, and final tours cut short by COVID and Corea's passing, remembered as a pinnacle of modern jazz trio interplay.[4]

## Fun Facts
- The trio was incubated from Chick Corea's Five Peace Band rhythm section and debuted at the 2010 Ottawa Jazz Festival before their Grammy-winning Trilogy release.[3][4]
- Chick Corea insisted the group was a 'cooperative of equals' despite McBride and Blade viewing him as a 'giant,' fostering deep camaraderie over 10+ years.[4]
- Their 2020 European tour, including a Budapest piano concerto commission for Corea, was halted by COVID just before his passing a year later.[4][9]
- Trilogy's live recordings spanned global performances, showcasing 'spectacularly virtuosic' interplay that McBride called a 'safe space.'[1][2][4]
