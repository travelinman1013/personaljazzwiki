# Back Door

## Biography
Back Door was a British jazz-rock trio formed in 1971 in Redcar, North Yorkshire, by bassist Colin Hodgkinson, saxophonist and keyboardist Ron Aspery, and drummer Tony Hicks.[1][2][3] Emerging from the vibrant jazz-rock scene, the band distinguished itself with an unconventional instrumentation of bass, drums, and saxophone, delivering energetic performances that blended jazz improvisation, rock drive, and blues elements.[1][3][6] Their raw, hungry sound captured attention in the early 1970s British progressive and fusion circuits, leading to a series of albums that showcased their instrumental prowess and live intensity.[3][6]

The group's career developed through relentless touring and recordings on labels like Warner Bros., with standout releases highlighting Hodgkinson's virtuosic bass work, Aspery's versatile reeds, and Hicks' solid drumming.[1][6] Though they remained somewhat under the radar compared to peers, Back Door's music exemplified the late-blooming jazz-rock spirit of the era, influencing niche fusion audiences with their minimalist yet powerful setup.[6] The band disbanded in the late 1970s, but their legacy endures among fans of instrumental jazz-rock for pioneering a stripped-down trio format that prioritized spontaneity and technical skill.[1][3]

## Fun Facts
- Back Door's highly unusual lineup of bass, drums, and saxophone set them apart in the jazz-rock scene, with no guitar or traditional frontline instruments.[1][6]
- The band originated in the coastal town of Redcar, North Yorkshire, a hub for emerging British fusion talent in the early 1970s.[2]
- They were described as 'the hungriest of them all' for their relentless energy and live performances.[3]
