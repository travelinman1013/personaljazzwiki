## Biography
Quincy Delight Jones Jr. (March 14, 1933 – November 3, 2024) was an American record producer, composer, arranger, conductor, trumpeter, and bandleader who became one of the most influential figures in modern music history. Born in Chicago, Jones rose to prominence in the 1950s as a jazz arranger and conductor, performing as a trumpeter with legendary bandleaders Lionel Hampton and Dizzy Gillespie. In 1956, he embarked on a State Department-sponsored tour of the Middle East and South America with Dizzy Gillespie's band, establishing himself as a serious musical talent. His early career trajectory accelerated when he moved to Paris in 1957, where he studied composition and theory with renowned classical composers Nadia Boulanger and Olivier Messiaen, broadening his musical foundation beyond jazz into classical and orchestral domains.[4][5]

Jones achieved breakthrough success in the early 1960s as a record producer and arranger, becoming the first African American vice president of Mercury Records in 1961—a historic barrier-breaking achievement in the entertainment industry.[4][5] He produced hit records for Lesley Gore, including "It's My Party" (1963), and arranged and conducted collaborations between Frank Sinatra and Count Basie that gained immense critical acclaim.[1][2] His transition into film scoring began in 1964 when director Sidney Lumet invited him to compose music for *The Pawnbroker*, launching a prolific career composing scores for over 35 films including *In Cold Blood*, *In the Heat of the Night*, and *The Italian Job*.[6] However, Jones's most transformative work came through his production of Michael Jackson's groundbreaking albums: *Off the Wall* (1979), *Thriller* (1982), and *Bad* (1987), with *Thriller* becoming the best-selling album of all time with over 46 million copies sold worldwide.[1][4]

Beyond music production, Jones became a multimedia entrepreneur and cultural ambassador, co-producing the historic 1985 charity single "We Are the World" and co-producing Steven Spielberg's *The Color Purple* (1985), which earned 11 Oscar nominations.[4][5] He founded Qwest Broadcasting in 1994, becoming chairman and CEO of one of the largest minority-owned broadcasting companies in the United States, which was sold for $270 million in 1999.[1] Throughout his seven-decade career, Jones received 28 Grammy Awards (making him the most nominated Grammy artist with 80 total nominations), an Emmy Award, a Tony Award, seven Academy Award nominations, and achieved rare EGOT status.[2][3][4] His legacy encompasses virtually every medium of entertainment—records, live performance, movies, and television—establishing him as an unparalleled creative force who continuously broke racial and artistic barriers throughout his career.
