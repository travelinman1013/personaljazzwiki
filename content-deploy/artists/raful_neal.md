## Biography
Raful Neal was born on June 6, 1936, in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and became a foundational figure in the Baton Rouge blues scene. He began playing harmonica as a teenager, inspired by the sounds of Chicago blues, and by his late teens, he was already leading his own band, the Clouds, which helped establish his reputation locally[2][3][4][5]. Neal's career spanned over five decades, during which he became known for his soulful vocals and expressive harmonica playing, blending traditional blues with the distinctive Louisiana R&B sound.

Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, Neal performed extensively in the South, recording singles and building a loyal following. He released several albums, most notably for the Alligator and Ichiban labels, and his music often reflected the struggles and joys of everyday life in Louisiana. Neal's influence extended beyond his own recordings; he was a mentor to many younger musicians, including his son Kenny Neal, who would go on to become a blues star in his own right[2][5].

Raful Neal's legacy is marked by his role in shaping the Baton Rouge blues tradition and his contributions to the broader American blues landscape. He remained active as a performer until his death on September 1, 2004, leaving behind a large musical family and a lasting impact on the genre[3][5].
