## Biography
Les Rois du Fox-Trot is a French jazz ensemble founded to revive and celebrate the exuberant spirit of the 'Années Folles' (the Roaring Twenties) and the early big band era, focusing on the lively, danceable style known as 'Jazz Hot.' The band was originally led by cornetist, arranger, and jazz historian Jean-Pierre Morel, who assembled a group of ten accomplished musicians to authentically reinterpret the music of jazz pioneers such as Duke Ellington, King Oliver, Louis Armstrong, and Fletcher Henderson. Their repertoire is characterized by lush arrangements, prominent soloists, and a sonic texture featuring lyrical saxophone sections and expressive brass effects, all designed to capture the jubilant and unrestrained energy of early jazz dance bands.[2][4]

Throughout their career, Les Rois du Fox-Trot have performed at jazz festivals, dance events, and concert halls, faithfully recreating the sound and atmosphere of 1920s and 1930s American jazz. The ensemble's lineup has included Jean-Pierre Morel and Shona Taylor on cornets, Patrick Bacqueville on trombone and vocals, Marc Bresdin, Nicolas Montier, and Michel Bescont on saxophones and clarinets, Bernard Thévin on piano, François Fournet on banjo, Gérard Gervois on tuba, and Laurence Bridard on drums. Their performances are noted for their vibrant energy, technical precision, and deep respect for the historical roots of jazz.[2][4][6][7]

Les Rois du Fox-Trot have contributed to the preservation and popularization of early jazz in France and Europe, introducing new audiences to the infectious rhythms and improvisational flair of the genre. Their work stands as a testament to the enduring appeal of jazz as both a musical and social phenomenon, bridging the gap between past and present through meticulous musicianship and passionate performance.
