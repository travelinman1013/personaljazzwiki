## Biography
Willie Dixon (July 1, 1915 – January 29, 1992) was born in Vicksburg, Mississippi, and emerged as one of the most influential figures in blues music and a crucial architect of the Chicago blues sound. His early life was marked by poverty and hardship, including time spent on prison farms as a young teenager, where he was first exposed to blues music. Dixon's musical foundation was deeply rooted in gospel traditions—he sang in church at age four and learned vocal harmony from local carpenter Theo Phelps, who led the Union Jubilee Singers gospel quintet. His mother wrote religious poetry, and these early influences shaped his artistic sensibility throughout his life. In 1939, he co-founded the Five Breezes, a vocal harmony group that blended blues, jazz, and gospel elements. During World War II, Dixon refused military induction as a conscientious objector and was imprisoned for ten months, temporarily halting his musical progress.

After the war, Dixon's career accelerated significantly. He formed the Big Three Trio (1946–1952), a popular cocktail trio known for singing blues in three-part harmony, where he honed his composition and production skills. In the early 1950s, he secured a full-time position at Chess Records as a house bassist, arranger, and record producer—a role that would define his legacy. As a prolific songwriter and studio mastermind, Dixon composed iconic songs such as "Hoochie Coochie Man," "My Babe," "Spoonful," "Little Red Rooster," and "Seventh Son," which became standards of Chicago blues. He worked extensively with blues legends including Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, Little Walter, Sonny Boy Williamson II, and Koko Taylor, playing string bass on numerous sessions and producing their most celebrated recordings. In the late 1950s, he briefly worked with Cobra Records, where he nurtured Otis Rush and other emerging talents.

Dixon's influence extended far beyond the blues world. He served as a crucial link between blues and rock and roll, working with Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley in the late 1950s and producing their early hits including "Roll Over Beethoven" and "Johnny B. Goode." In the 1960s, he toured Europe with the American Folk Blues Festival, directly influencing British rock bands including the Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, Cream, and the Jeff Beck Group. His songs were adapted and covered by numerous rock artists, with some versions selling millions of copies. Dixon defined his blues as an expression of "the true facts of life," using his music to convey real-life wisdom and social commentary. His achievements earned him induction into the Blues Hall of Fame (1980) and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (1994), as well as a Grammy Award. In 1977, he retrieved the copyrights to his songs, and in 1982, he founded the Blues Heaven Foundation to help musicians reclaim their copyrights, promote the blues tradition, and educate young people about the genre's history.
