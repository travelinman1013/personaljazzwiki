## Biography
Jimmy Dawkins (born October 24, 1936, in Tchula, Mississippi) was a leading figure in the Chicago blues scene, celebrated for his expressive guitar work and contributions to the 'West Side' sound. Growing up in Mississippi, Dawkins was influenced by both the traditional blues of his home state and the vibrant music of New Orleans, which he encountered during his childhood in Pascagoula. He taught himself guitar using an instrument belonging to his uncle and moved to Chicago in 1955, where he initially worked in a box factory while playing in local clubs at night.

Dawkins quickly gained a reputation as a skilled session musician, performing alongside other rising stars of the Chicago blues scene. His breakthrough came in 1969 with the release of his debut album 'Fast Fingers' on Delmark Records, a project facilitated by his friend and mentor Magic Sam. The album earned international acclaim, winning the Grand Prix du Disque from the Hot Club de France. Over the following decades, Dawkins toured extensively in Europe and Japan, recorded prolifically, and became known for his improvisational, spontaneous approach to the blues. In addition to his own music, he promoted other artists through his label Leric Records and contributed to the founding of the influential magazine 'Living Blues.'

Dawkins's style was marked by a modern, urban edge, blending the soulful traditions of Mississippi blues with the sophisticated rhythms of Chicago. Though sometimes overshadowed as a vocalist, his guitar playing was widely admired for its nuance and emotional depth. His legacy endures through his recordings, his mentorship of younger musicians, and his role in shaping the sound of modern blues.
