## Biography
Ann Savoy, born Ann Allen on January 20, 1952, in St. Louis, Missouri, and raised in Richmond, Virginia, grew up in a household steeped in music and poetry, which laid the foundation for her lifelong artistic pursuits[1][2]. She was gifted a plastic ukulele at age 10 and became fluent in French by 13, an early sign of her deep connection to language and culture[1]. Her musical journey took a decisive turn in 1975 when she met Cajun accordionist Marc Savoy, whom she would later marry, and moved to Louisiana in 1977[1][3]. There, she immersed herself in Cajun music, shifting from the country blues, Virginia folk, and British rock of her youth to mastering Cajun guitar and becoming a celebrated practitioner of the genre[1]. Savoy’s career is marked by her role as both a performer and a historian, recording over 20 albums, producing Grammy-nominated projects, and authoring authoritative books on Cajun and Zydeco music[1][2][3]. Her work with the Savoy-Doucet Cajun Band, the Magnolia Sisters, and the Savoy Family Band has taken her around the world, and she is recognized as a matriarch of Louisiana’s folk scene, celebrated for both preserving and innovating within the Cajun tradition[1][2].

## Fun Facts
- Ann Savoy’s first language was French, which she learned by age 13, and she later studied French literature in Europe, deeply influencing her artistic perspective[1][4].
- She is a four-time Grammy nominee, including for her work with Linda Ronstadt and the Magnolia Sisters[3].
- Savoy’s extensive interviews with Louisiana musicians form the basis of the Arhoolie Ann Savoy Cajun Interviews Collection, a major archival resource for Cajun and Zydeco music[1].
- She appeared as a musician in the films Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood and All The King’s Men, and was associate music director for the latter[2][3].
