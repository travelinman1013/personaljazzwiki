## Biography
Commander Cody, born George Frayne on July 19, 1944, in Ann Arbor, Michigan, was a pioneering figure in American country rock and roots music. Raised on Long Island, New York, Frayne studied art and design at the University of Michigan, where he met future bandmate John Tichy. Their shared musical interests led to the formation of several bands, culminating in Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen in 1967. The group fused rock and roll, rhythm and blues, jazz, country, western swing, and rockabilly, creating a vibrant, eclectic sound that set them apart from their contemporaries[2][3][5].

After earning his master's degree in sculpture and painting in 1968, Frayne devoted himself to music full-time. The band relocated to Berkeley, California, and became known for their marathon live shows and wild, uninhibited performances. Their biggest hit, "Hot Rod Lincoln," exemplified their energetic style and bar band ethos. Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen played a crucial role in the development of the Austin, Texas music scene and influenced the rise of country rock in the 1970s, inspiring acts like Asleep at the Wheel[2][3][5].

Beyond his musical career, Frayne was also a respected visual artist and educator, with his works exhibited in museums and galleries. His legacy endures through his innovative blending of genres, his impact on the bar band tradition, and his influence on subsequent generations of musicians seeking authenticity and live performance energy[2][3][5].
