## Biography
Julie London, born Julie (or Gayle) Peck on September 26, 1926, in Santa Rosa, California, was the only child of vaudeville performers Jack and Josephine Peck, who also hosted a radio show where she made her first public performance at age three. The family moved to Los Angeles in 1941 during her early teens, amid the Great Depression's uncertainties; she left school to work as a department store elevator operator while beginning to sing with local orchestras like the Matty Malnech Orchestra and performing underage in nightclubs until barred.[1][2][3] Spotted by talent scout Sue Carol (wife of Alan Ladd), she adopted the stage name Julie London, appeared in B-movies, and in 1947 married actor Jack Webb, sharing a love of jazz that led to early recordings, though her serious singing career launched later after their divorce.[1][2][3]

Encouraged by jazz composer Bobby Troup—whom she married in 1959 after meeting at a party—Troup arranged a 1955 nightclub showcase at the 881 Club despite her severe stage fright, impressing Liberty Records producer Simon Waronker and launching her recording career with the debut album *Julie Is Her Name*, featuring the massive hit 'Cry Me a River,' which sold over three million copies and topped charts.[1][2][3] Known for her sultry, smoky contralto voice and minimalist style—often backed by just guitar (e.g., Al Viola, Barney Kessel) and bass—she recorded over 30 albums of pop and jazz standards by composers like Cole Porter, Gershwins, and Irving Berlin between 1955 and 1969, favoring intimate small combos over big bands despite commercial pressures for orchestral arrangements.[2][3]

London transitioned to acting in the 1970s, starring as Nurse Dixie McCall in the TV series *Emergency!* (1972–1979) alongside husband Bobby Troup and produced by ex-husband Jack Webb, earning a Golden Globe nomination; she retired from professional singing after her final album *Yummy, Yummy, Yummy* (1969) due to vocal damage from smoking and drinking. She passed away on October 18, 2000, leaving a legacy as a torch singer whose whispery, vulnerable delivery defined mid-century vocal jazz.[2][3][4]

## Fun Facts
- Despite her sultry image and hit 'Cry Me a River,' London suffered crippling stage fright throughout her career and once said, 'I don’t think I’m a very good singer at all,' finding recording 'painful' if anything was imprecise.[2]
- Her 1960 album *Julie... At Home* was recorded in her living room for its natural acoustics, featuring a small combo of guitar, bass, vibraphone, and drums.[2]
- She was barred from nightclubs as a teen for being underage but still performed jazz locally while working as a department store elevator operator.[1][2]
- London sang 13 classics including 'Cry Me a River' on a 1964 Japanese TV special with Bobby Troup.[3]
