## Biography
Betty Wright, born Bessie Regina Norris on December 21, 1953, in Miami, Florida, was a prodigious talent whose career began in childhood as a member of her family's gospel group, the Echoes of Joy. By age 11, she transitioned to R&B and was signed to Deep City Records at just 12 years old, releasing her debut album 'My First Time Around' at 14. Her first hit, 'Girls Can't Do What the Guys Do,' arrived soon after, but it was 1971’s 'Clean Up Woman' that catapulted her to national fame, reaching the top of the R&B and pop charts and showcasing her distinctive, soulful voice and mastery of the whistle register.

Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Wright became a mainstay of classic soul, known for hits like 'Tonight Is the Night,' 'Where Is the Love' (which won her a Grammy in 1975), and 'No Pain (No Gain).' She was a pioneering businesswoman, founding her own label, Ms. B Records, and making history as the first black woman to release a gold album on her own imprint with 1988’s 'Mother Wit.' Wright’s influence extended beyond her own recordings: she was an in-demand background vocalist, producer, and vocal coach, working with artists across genres and generations.

Wright’s legacy is defined by her powerful, emotive singing, her innovative use of the whistle register, and her mentorship of younger artists. She remained active in music until her passing from cancer on May 10, 2020, leaving behind a profound impact on soul, R&B, and contemporary pop music.
