## Biography
Jerry Reed Hubbard (March 20, 1937 – September 1, 2008), known professionally as Jerry Reed, was an American country music singer, guitarist, songwriter, and actor born in Atlanta, Georgia. Reed's early life was marked by family hardship—his parents separated shortly after his birth, and he spent several years in foster care before reuniting with his mother. He began playing guitar at age seven, learning basic chords from his mother and developing his skills by listening to country guitarists like Merle Travis and Chet Atkins. By his teens, Reed was performing alongside country stars such as Ernest Tubb and Faron Young, and he signed his first record contract with Capitol Records at age seventeen.

Reed's career blossomed in Nashville, where he became known for his virtuosic, syncopated fingerstyle guitar technique and his witty, story-driven songwriting. He wrote hits for artists including Elvis Presley and Chet Atkins, while also recording his own chart-topping songs such as 'Guitar Man,' 'Amos Moses,' 'When You're Hot, You're Hot,' and 'East Bound and Down'—the latter serving as the theme for the film 'Smokey and the Bandit,' in which Reed co-starred. His musical style blended classic country, rockabilly, blues, and funk, earning him three Grammy Awards and a reputation as a genre innovator.

Beyond music, Reed enjoyed a successful acting career, appearing in more than a dozen films, most notably alongside Burt Reynolds in the 'Smokey and the Bandit' series. He was inducted into the Musicians Hall of Fame and the Country Music Hall of Fame, leaving a legacy as a pioneering guitarist, a beloved entertainer, and a key figure in the evolution of country music.
