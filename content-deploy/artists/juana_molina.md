## Biography
Juana Molina is an Argentine singer, songwriter, producer, and former comedian, celebrated for her distinctive blend of folk, electronica, and experimental pop. Born in Buenos Aires into a highly artistic family—her father is revered tango singer and composer Horacio Molina and her mother is actress Elva “Chunchuna” Villafañe—she grew up surrounded by music and film, learning guitar from her father at around five years old and absorbing her mother’s extensive record collection.[1][2][5] Following the 1976 military coup in Argentina, her family lived in exile in Paris for about six years, an experience that broadened her musical horizons with sounds from around the world.[1][2] Back in Argentina as a young adult, she initially sought financial independence and, using her talent for impressions, entered television, quickly rising through sketch shows to become one of the country’s most popular comedians with her early‑1990s series *Juana y sus hermanas*, syndicated throughout South America.[1][2][4][7]

Despite her enormous success on TV, Molina’s first love remained music. After taking a break from her show to have her daughter, she made the radical decision to cancel *Juana y sus hermanas* in the mid‑1990s and devote herself fully to songwriting and recording.[2][5][7] Her debut album *Rara* appeared in 1996 and was initially met with skepticism in Argentina, where many treated it as a celebrity vanity project.[1][2][5] Undeterred, she moved to Los Angeles, where she began experimenting deeply with electronics, looping, and home recording, work that culminated in her second album *Segundo* and subsequent releases such as *Tres cosas*, *Son*, *Un día*, *Wed 21*, and *Halo*, many of them issued by Domino Records and later by Crammed Discs.[1][2][3][5][6] Over time, critics and international audiences embraced her hypnotic, layered approach—often built from voice, guitar, and subtle electronics—earning her a reputation as a visionary figure at the intersection of indie, folk, and experimental music. By the 2010s she was widely recognized as a pioneering artist whose later work, including *Wed 21* and *Halo*, was hailed in the music press as some of her finest, cementing her legacy as one of Argentina’s most original contemporary musicians.[1][2][6][8]

## Fun Facts
- As a child, Juana Molina secretly recorded the song “Te regalo esta canción” with her father as a Mother’s Day gift; he unexpectedly released it as a single, and it became a hit in Argentina, selling around 45,000 copies.[2]
- At the height of her fame as Argentina’s most popular TV comedian, Molina stunned audiences and industry alike by voluntarily canceling her successful show *Juana y sus hermanas* in order to pursue music full‑time.[2][5][7]
- Her early music audiences in Argentina often came to her shows expecting comedy; some thought her new folk‑singer persona was just another character and waited for a punchline that never arrived.[5]
- Molina’s signature sound grew out of solitary experimentation in Los Angeles, where she began building songs from layered loops of guitar, voice, and electronics long before such techniques became common in indie and experimental pop circles.[1][2][6]
