## Biography
Booker T. Jones, born in Memphis, Tennessee in 1944, emerged as a child prodigy with a deep affinity for music, mastering multiple instruments from an early age. By age 12, he was already playing piano in church with gospel legend Mahalia Jackson, and by 16, he was recording at Stax Records, contributing saxophone to Rufus and Carla Thomas’s 'Cause I Love You.' His academic pursuits in music composition at Indiana University ran parallel to his burgeoning career, requiring frequent travel between school and Memphis for recording sessions.

Jones became internationally renowned as the frontman and organist for Booker T. & the MGs, the Stax house band whose 1962 hit 'Green Onions' became an enduring classic and a defining moment in soul and funk music. The group’s racially integrated lineup and versatile musicianship allowed them to back a roster of soul greats, including Otis Redding and Sam & Dave, while also producing their own influential albums. Jones’s songwriting and arranging talents extended to penning classics like 'Born Under a Bad Sign' for Albert King and 'I Love You More Than Words Can Say' for Otis Redding.

Throughout his career, Jones pushed the boundaries of soul, R&B, and funk, both as a performer and a producer. His legacy includes collaborations with artists across genres—from Neil Young and Bob Dylan to Willie Nelson—and a profound influence on the development of modern soul and pop music. Recognized with a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, Jones remains a pivotal architect of the Memphis soul sound and a lasting inspiration to generations of musicians.
