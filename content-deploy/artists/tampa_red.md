## Biography
Hudson Whittaker, born Hudson Woodbridge on January 8, 1903 (though some sources cite 1904) in Smithville, Georgia, became one of the most influential figures in Chicago blues history under the stage name Tampa Red.[1][2] After his parents died in childhood, he moved to Tampa, Florida, where he was raised by his grandmother and adopted the surname Whittaker. Inspired by his older brother Eddie's guitar playing and a street musician named Piccolo Pete who taught him blues licks, Tampa Red also drew inspiration from early blues recordings by female singers like Mamie Smith, Bessie Smith, and Ida Cox.[1][2][4] By 1925, he had perfected his distinctive single-string slide guitar technique and moved to Chicago to pursue music professionally, adopting the name "Tampa Red" in reference to his childhood home in Florida and his light complexion.[1][2]

Tampa Red's career spanned over 30 years and made him one of the most prolific recording artists in blues history.[1][3] Beginning with his 1928 recording debut of "It's Tight Like That" with pianist Thomas A. Dorsey (Georgia Tom), he recorded nearly 90 sides with Dorsey and became a session musician in high demand, working with artists including John Lee "Sonny Boy" Williamson, Memphis Minnie, and Big Maceo.[1] He formed the Chicago Five, a group of session musicians whose work created the "Bluebird sound," a precursor to jump blues and rock-and-roll.[1][2] His home became a center for Chicago's blues community, providing rehearsal space, bookings, and lodgings for musicians migrating from the Mississippi Delta.[1][2] Record companies released more 78rpm records by Tampa Red than by any other blues artist during his peak years, with his compositions including classics such as "It Hurts Me Too," "Crying Won't Help You," "Love Her with a Feeling," and "Let Me Play with Your Poodle."[3] By the 1940s, he had transitioned to electric guitar and achieved significant commercial success, with "Let Me Play with Your Poodle" reaching number 4 on Billboard's "Harlem Hit Parade" in 1942.[1] He was rediscovered during the blues revival of the late 1950s and made his final recordings in 1960.[1][2] Following his wife's death in 1953, Tampa Red struggled with alcoholism and spent his final years living quietly on Chicago's South Side, eventually in a nursing home, before his death on March 19, 1981, at age 77.[1][3]

## Fun Facts
- Tampa Red earned his stage name from two sources: his childhood home in Tampa, Florida, and his distinctive light-colored (reddish) complexion, with some sources noting he had bright red hair.[1][2][7]
- Record companies released more 78rpm records by Tampa Red than by any other blues artist during his peak recording years, making him one of the most prolific blues recording artists in history.[3]
- Tampa Red's home in Chicago became such an important center for the blues community that it served as a combination rehearsal space, booking office, and boarding house for musicians arriving from the Mississippi Delta as blues became commercially viable.[1][2]
- His 1942 recording "Let Me Play with Your Poodle" reached number 4 on Billboard's "Harlem Hit Parade," a forerunner of the modern R&B chart, demonstrating his crossover appeal beyond traditional blues audiences.[1]
