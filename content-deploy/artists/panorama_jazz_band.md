## Biography
The Panorama Jazz Band is a New Orleans-based ensemble founded in 1995 by clarinetist Ben Schenck, who relocated from Washington, D.C. to New Orleans after being inspired by the city's vibrant jazz scene in the mid-1980s. Schenck's vision was to create a group that could perform without amplification, blending the traditional sounds of New Orleans jazz with the rich melodies and rhythms of klezmer and other world music traditions. The band began as a small trio and gradually expanded, performing regularly at local venues such as Lucky's on St. Charles, which helped them build a dedicated following and attract a diverse array of musicians.[1][2][4]

Panorama Jazz Band is renowned for its eclectic repertoire, which spans New Orleans jazz, klezmer, Balkan, Caribbean, and Latin American styles. Their performances are marked by a danceable energy and a commitment to both authenticity and innovation, often moving seamlessly from a Martinique swing waltz to a Macedonian wedding dance or a Jewish folk tune. Over the years, the band has released several recordings, including 'Come Out Swingin’,' 'Panoramaland,' and 'The Next One,' the latter featuring collaborations with renowned musicians and arrangements that highlight their signature fusion of genres.[2][3]

The band’s legacy is deeply tied to the New Orleans community, serving as a staple at weddings, parades, and Mardi Gras celebrations. Despite setbacks such as the displacement caused by Hurricane Katrina, Panorama Jazz Band has remained resilient, continuing to evolve and inspire both audiences and fellow musicians with their adventurous spirit and dedication to musical exploration.[1][2][3]
