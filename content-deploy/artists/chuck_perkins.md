## Biography
Chuck Perkins is an acclaimed American spoken word poet, orator, narrator, and activist, born Charleston Perkins on August 25, 1965, in New Orleans, Louisiana. Raised in a culturally rich but challenging environment, Perkins was shaped by the rhythms and vernacular of New Orleans, which would later become central to his artistic identity. His early life was marked by both academic promise and the realities of growing up in a neighborhood deeply affected by social and economic struggles. After graduating high school in 1983, he served in the Marine Corps before pursuing higher education, eventually graduating from college in 1992.

Perkins' career as a poet and performer is distinguished by his dynamic fusion of jazz, blues, and the spoken word tradition, often addressing themes of race, class, and the lived experience of New Orleans. His performances are known for their passionate delivery and incisive social critique, earning him the moniker 'Poet Laureate of New Orleans.' He has performed internationally, sharing stages with luminaries such as Amiri Baraka and appearing at venues like London's South Bank Centre, as well as in Paris, Toulouse, Manchester, Liverpool, Cambridge, and Amsterdam. Perkins' work is deeply rooted in the cultural and historical tapestry of New Orleans, and he is recognized for infusing his poetry with the city's unique rhythms and spirit.

Perkins' legacy lies in his ability to bridge the worlds of poetry, music, and activism, using his art to amplify the voices and stories of his community. He continues to be a vital presence in both local and international literary scenes, and is currently working on his first book of poetry, 'Beautiful and Ugly Too.'
