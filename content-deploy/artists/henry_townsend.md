## Biography
Henry Townsend was born on October 27, 1909, in Shelby, Mississippi, but his family moved frequently, eventually settling in St. Louis, Missouri, where he became a cornerstone of the local blues scene. Inspired by guitarists like Lonnie Johnson and Clifford Gibson, Townsend began his career in the late 1920s, making his first recordings for Columbia in 1929. He continued to record throughout the decades, collaborating with notable blues artists such as Roosevelt Sykes, Walter Davis, and Robert Nighthawk. After World War II, Townsend transitioned into other careers but returned to music in the 1960s, recording albums and mentoring young musicians. His legacy includes being the only blues artist to have recorded in every decade from the 1920s to the 2000s. Townsend passed away on September 24, 2006, at the age of 96, leaving behind a rich musical legacy that earned him a posthumous Grammy Award in 2008 for his contribution to the album 'Last of the Great Mississippi Delta Bluesmen: Live in Dallas.' Townsend's musical style was characterized by his mastery of both guitar and piano, and his ability to improvise lyrics, which made him a versatile and influential figure in the blues genre. His contributions to the St. Louis blues scene were pivotal, and he is remembered as a patriarch of that community.
