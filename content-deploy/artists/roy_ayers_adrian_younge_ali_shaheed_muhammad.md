## Biography
Roy Ayers, Adrian Younge, and Ali Shaheed Muhammad are three influential musicians whose collaboration bridges generations of jazz, funk, and hip-hop. Roy Ayers, born in Los Angeles in 1940, is a legendary vibraphonist and composer, widely regarded as a pioneer of jazz-funk and a foundational figure in the development of acid jazz and neo-soul. His career began in the 1960s, and by the 1970s, with his band Ubiquity, Ayers was blending jazz with R&B, disco, and soul, crafting a sound that would be heavily sampled by later hip-hop and electronic artists. He toured globally, including a notable stint in Nigeria with Fela Kuti, and his music has influenced countless musicians across genres.[3][5]

Adrian Younge, a Los Angeles-based multi-instrumentalist, producer, and composer, is known for his analog recording techniques and cinematic, Blaxploitation-inspired soul and funk. Younge's work includes collaborations with Wu-Tang Clan, Souls of Mischief, and Jay-Z. Ali Shaheed Muhammad, born in Brooklyn in 1970, is best known as a founding member of the seminal hip-hop group A Tribe Called Quest, as well as the R&B supergroup Lucy Pearl. Muhammad's deep roots in hip-hop and jazz have made him a key figure in bridging classic jazz with contemporary sounds.[1][2][4]

Together, Younge and Muhammad formed The Midnight Hour and launched the 'Jazz Is Dead' project, a series of albums and live events designed to celebrate and revitalize jazz by collaborating with legendary musicians. Their 2020 album with Roy Ayers, 'Roy Ayers JID 002,' was recorded in Los Angeles and is celebrated for capturing the spirit of Ayers' classic 1970s work while infusing it with modern sensibilities. This collaboration stands as a testament to the enduring legacy of jazz-funk and the power of intergenerational musical dialogue.[2][3][5]
