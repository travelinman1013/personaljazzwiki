## Biography
Christy Moore, born Christopher Andrew Moore on May 7, 1945, in Newbridge, County Kildare, Ireland, is one of the most influential figures in Irish folk music. Raised in a musical family—his younger brother is the singer Luka Bloom—Moore initially worked as a bank clerk before a 1966 bank strike led him to England, where he immersed himself in the vibrant folk scene and connected with traditional musicians such as Seamus Ennis and Luke Kelly. His debut album, 'Paddy on the Road,' was released in 1969, marking the start of a prolific solo career.

Moore is best known for founding the seminal bands Planxty and Moving Hearts, which played pivotal roles in modernizing and popularizing Irish traditional music. Planxty, formed in 1972 with Liam O'Flynn, Andy Irvine, and Dónal Lunny, blended traditional Irish sounds with contemporary influences, while Moving Hearts, co-founded in 1980, incorporated elements of rock and jazz. Moore's songwriting is celebrated for its social commentary, humor, and deep sense of Irish identity, addressing both everyday life and significant social issues. Over his decades-long career, he has released numerous acclaimed albums and remained a passionate live performer, earning recognition as Ireland's greatest living musician in 2007.

Moore's legacy extends beyond his own recordings; he has inspired generations of musicians and is credited with bringing Irish folk music to new audiences worldwide. His performances are noted for their emotional intensity and storytelling, making him a beloved figure in Irish culture and a respected voice for social change.
