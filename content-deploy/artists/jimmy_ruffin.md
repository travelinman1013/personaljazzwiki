## Biography
Jimmy Ruffin was born on May 7, 1939, in Collinsville, Mississippi, and grew up singing gospel music with his family, including his younger brother David Ruffin, who would later become the lead singer of The Temptations[2][3][4]. After moving to Detroit, Jimmy began working with Berry Gordy's Motown operation in 1961, initially as a session singer and backup vocalist, before releasing his debut single 'Don't Feel Sorry for Me' on Motown's Miracle Records[1][3]. His career was briefly interrupted when he was drafted into the Army, but upon returning in 1964, he rejoined Motown, which had by then become a powerhouse in soul music[1][2].

Ruffin's breakthrough came with the 1966 hit 'What Becomes of the Brokenhearted,' a poignant ballad that resonated with audiences and climbed to #7 on the US pop chart and #8 in the UK[1][3]. His emotive, heartfelt vocal style and classic soul arrangements made him a favorite among fans of Motown and Northern Soul. He released several successful singles and albums throughout the late 1960s and 1970s, including collaborations with his brother David as the Ruffin Brothers, notably on the album 'I Am My Brother’s Keeper' and their cover of 'Stand By Me'[2].

Although his popularity waned in the US, Ruffin found enduring success in the UK, where he became a Northern Soul icon and lived for two decades[3]. He staged a comeback in 1980 with 'Hold On to My Love,' produced by Robin Gibb of the Bee Gees[2]. Jimmy Ruffin's legacy lies in his ability to convey deep emotion through his music, influencing generations of soul singers and remaining a beloved figure in classic soul and Motown history. He passed away on November 17, 2014[2][3].
