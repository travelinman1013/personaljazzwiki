## Biography
Leon Bismark 'Bix' Beiderbecke was born on March 10, 1903, in Davenport, Iowa, into a middle-class German-American family. From an early age, he displayed remarkable musical talent, beginning to play songs by ear on his family's piano when he was just four years old and being considered a child prodigy. While he had some early piano lessons, Beiderbecke preferred improvising and 'improving' classical melodies rather than learning to read music properly. His musical direction changed dramatically at age 15 when he heard the Original Dixieland Jazz Band's recording of 'Tiger Rag,' which inspired him to pursue jazz music despite his parents' disapproval of his musical ambitions.

Beiderbecke's professional career began in earnest when he joined the Wolverine Orchestra in 1923, making his recording debut with the group on February 18, 1924. His rapid development can be traced through the band's recordings over the next eight months, with his solos becoming longer and more personal on classics like 'Riverboat Shuffle,' 'Royal Garden Blues,' and 'Big Boy.' He became arguably the first significant white jazz soloist in a music whose pacesetters had been exclusively African-American. After brief stints with Jean Goldkette's Orchestra (where his inability to read music initially cost him the job), he found his most significant collaborations with saxophonist Frankie 'Tram' Trumbauer, eventually joining the prestigious Paul Whiteman Orchestra in 1928.

Beiderbecke's musical style was characterized by an unusual purity of tone and inventive lyrical approach, with one contemporary describing his sound as like 'shooting bullets at a bell.' His seminal recordings 'Singin' the Blues' and 'I'm Coming, Virginia' (both 1927) demonstrated his gift for extended improvisation and helped invent the jazz ballad style. His piano composition 'In a Mist' (1927) mixed classical impressionist influences with jazz syncopation, reflecting his unique harmonic sophistication. Despite his immense talent and influence on the development of cool jazz, Beiderbecke's life was cut tragically short by alcoholism, dying on August 6, 1931, at just 28 years old, making him jazz's first cult hero.

## Fun Facts
- Beiderbecke taught himself to play cornet largely by ear, leading him to adopt non-standard fingering that some critics connected to his original sound
- He was expelled from military school outside Chicago in 1921 for skipping classes to play music, after which he became a full-time musician
- His nickname 'Bix' was a family tradition that had also been applied to his father and grandfather
- All five of his piano compositions were published by Robbins Music during his lifetime, with 'In a Mist' being the only one he recorded
