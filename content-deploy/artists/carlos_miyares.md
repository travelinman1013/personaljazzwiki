## Biography
Carlos Manuel Miyares Hernández, born April 25, 1980, in Santiago de Cuba, is a celebrated Cuban saxophonist, composer, arranger, and producer recognized for his expressive sound and technical brilliance. Immersed in Cuba’s rich musical heritage from a young age, he began his formal studies in piano at the José María Heredia Vocational School of Art before switching to saxophone, completing his early training under Master Raúl Cordies and later graduating from the Esteban Salas Conservatory with Master Julio Cesar Gonzales[2][1].

Throughout his career, Miyares has performed at major international jazz festivals and collaborated on over 50 recordings, working with renowned artists across genres.
