## Biography
Jack DeJohnette's New Directions was a pioneering jazz supergroup formed in 1978 by drummer and pianist Jack DeJohnette, one of the most influential figures in modern jazz. Born in Chicago in 1942, DeJohnette had already established himself as a versatile musician, working with legends such as Charles Lloyd, Miles Davis, and Keith Jarrett before assembling New Directions. The group was conceived as a synthesis of DeJohnette's diverse musical experiences, bringing together musicians from different backgrounds to explore the boundaries of jazz fusion and free jazz.

The original lineup of New Directions featured trumpeter Lester Bowie (of the Art Ensemble of Chicago), bassist Eddie Gomez (noted for his work with Bill Evans and Chick Corea), and guitarist John Abercrombie (an ECM mainstay with roots in jazz-rock fusion). This ensemble was notable for its eclecticism and improvisational spirit, blending ambient textures, avant-garde experimentation, and lyrical interplay. Their self-titled debut album, recorded in Oslo and released by ECM in 1978, was critically acclaimed and won France’s Prix du Jazz Contemporain de L’Academie Charles Cros. New Directions captured DeJohnette’s vision of jazz as a constantly evolving art form, where strong individual voices could merge into a unified, exploratory soundscape.

Though the group was relatively short-lived, New Directions left a lasting legacy in jazz, exemplifying the creative possibilities of cross-genre collaboration and collective improvisation. The band’s music is often described as dreamlike and atmospheric, with a unique chemistry that reflected the 'unlikely cast' DeJohnette assembled. Their work continues to be celebrated for its adventurous spirit and its role in shaping the direction of late 20th-century jazz.
