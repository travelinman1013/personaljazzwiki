## Biography
Jill Heather Scott, born April 4, 1972, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, is a renowned American singer, songwriter, poet, model, and actress. Raised as an only child in North Philadelphia by her mother and grandmother, Scott was immersed in a loving and musically rich environment, with her grandmother's daily singing inspiring her early interest in music[1][3]. She attended the Philadelphia High School for Girls and later Temple University, initially pursuing a career in education before shifting to the arts after becoming disillusioned with teaching[1][2][3].

Scott began her artistic journey as a performance poet, gaining recognition in Philadelphia's spoken word scene. Her breakthrough came when Amir "Questlove" Thompson of The Roots discovered her, leading to her co-writing the Grammy-winning track "You Got Me" and collaborations with artists such as Eric Benet, Common, and Will Smith[3][4]. Her debut album, "Who Is Jill Scott?: Words and Sounds Vol. 1" (2000), achieved platinum status and established her as a leading voice in neo soul, blending jazz, R&B, hip-hop, and spoken word. Subsequent albums, including "Beautifully Human: Words and Sounds Vol. 2" (2004) and "The Real Thing: Words and Sounds Vol. 3" (2007), further cemented her reputation for soulful, poetic storytelling[1][3].

Beyond music, Scott has enjoyed a successful acting career, appearing in Tyler Perry's "Why Did I Get Married?" (2007), the BBC/HBO series "The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency" (2008-09), and films such as "Get on Up" (2014). Her artistry, versatility, and commitment to authentic expression have made her an influential figure in contemporary R&B and neo soul, inspiring a new generation of musicians and earning multiple Grammy Awards[1][3][5].
