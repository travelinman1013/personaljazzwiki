## Biography
“Wild Magnolias & Bonerama” refers to a collaborative project that brings together two landmark New Orleans ensembles: the Mardi Gras Indian funk tribe **The Wild Magnolias** and the brass‑funk‑rock band **Bonerama**. The Wild Magnolias grew out of the Mardi Gras Indian “masking” tradition that dates back at least to the 1950s in New Orleans, eventually coming under the leadership of Big Chief Theodore “Bo” Dollis in 1964.[1] In the early 1970s they began recording groundbreaking sides like “Handa Wanda,” blending Indian chants, percussion, and street‑party call‑and‑response with a heavy funk rhythm section, and went on to cut influential 1970s albums for Barclay and Polydor that helped carry the sound of Mardi Gras Indians onto the world stage.[1] Bo Dollis’s son, Gerard “Bo Jr.” Dollis, later assumed the title of Big Chief and has led the Wild Magnolias in the 21st century, touring globally and continuing to update their signature mix of Indian masking, funk, and New Orleans street music.[1][6][7]

Bonerama, founded in 1998 by trombonists Mark Mullins and Craig Klein in New Orleans, approaches the city’s brass‑band tradition from a different angle, pushing trombones to the front line and mixing brass band roots with rock, funk, jazz, blues, gospel, and soul.[2][3][4] The group’s line‑ups have typically featured three trombones plus guitar, sousaphone, and drums, and they have released multiple albums while becoming known for high‑energy live shows and inventive arrangements that helped redefine what a brass band can sound like.[2][3][4][5] When the Wild Magnolias appear with Bonerama, the collaboration essentially fuses Mardi Gras Indian funk chanting and percussion with Bonerama’s amplified brass‑rock engine, creating a larger‑than‑life New Orleans revue that sits comfortably within Cajun/zydeco/brass‑band‑adjacent festival lineups even though it is firmly rooted in Mardi Gras Indian and brass‑funk traditions.[1][2][4] Although the pairing is primarily a live and festival billing rather than a formal, separately documented band with its own discography, it exemplifies the cross‑pollination and collaborative spirit of modern New Orleans music, extending the legacies of both the Wild Magnolias and Bonerama to new audiences.

In stylistic terms, the Wild Magnolias bring call‑and‑response chants, Indian masking rituals, parade percussion, and 1970s‑style New Orleans funk, while Bonerama contribute dense trombone harmonies, rock‑oriented backbeats, and an improvisational jazz sensibility.[1][2][3][4] Together, they underline how Mardi Gras Indian culture, brass bands, and funk‑rock have become interlocking strands of the same New Orleans tapestry, and their joint performances help transmit this cultural mix to festival and concert stages around the world.[1][2][4][6] Their impact lies less in chart success than in the way they embody and popularize living New Orleans traditions, inspiring younger musicians to blend cultural heritage with inventive, genre‑defying brass‑funk sounds.[1][2][4][6]

## Fun Facts
- The Wild Magnolias grew out of an actual Mardi Gras Indian tribe and only later became known internationally as a recording funk band, carrying the “Big Chief” leadership structure of a neighborhood tribe into the commercial music world.[1]
- Their early single "Handa Wanda" did not initially receive much radio airplay but became a local hit via jukeboxes and word of mouth, helping launch their recording career.[1]
- Bonerama was founded by trombonists who simultaneously played in Harry Connick Jr.’s big band, which meant its early members were already seasoned touring and recording musicians before the group took off on its own.[3]
- Bonerama often features three trombones as the front line, a configuration that is unusual even in New Orleans, giving their collaborations with vocal groups like the Wild Magnolias an especially dense and powerful brass sound.[2][3][4]
