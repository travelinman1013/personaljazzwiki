## Biography
Dr. Lonnie Smith (July 3, 1942 – September 28, 2021) was an American jazz Hammond B-3 organist celebrated for his soulful, funky approach to jazz and his mastery of the organ. Born in Lackawanna, New York, and raised in Buffalo, Smith was immersed in music from a young age, thanks to his mother’s involvement in gospel singing and his family’s vocal group and radio program. He began his musical journey singing in vocal ensembles and playing trumpet in school, but his destiny changed in the late 1950s when Art Kubera, a local music store owner, gifted him his first Hammond organ, setting him on the path to becoming a jazz legend[1][2][3][4][8].

Smith’s career took off in Buffalo’s Pine Grill Jazz Club, where he caught the attention of jazz luminaries like Jack McDuff, Lou Donaldson, and George Benson. Benson recruited Smith for his quartet, leading to several recordings and a move to New York City, where Smith quickly established himself as an innovator. He made his first recording as a leader, 'Finger-Lickin’ Good,' in 1966, and soon joined Lou Donaldson’s band, appearing on classic Blue Note albums such as 'Alligator Boogaloo.' Blue Note signed Smith as a solo artist, resulting in a series of influential soul jazz albums including 'Think!,' 'Turning Point,' 'Move Your Hand,' and 'Drives.' Over his five-decade career, Smith recorded more than 70 albums, collaborating with a wide array of jazz, blues, and R&B greats, and was recognized as one of the premier purveyors of funk and soul jazz[1][2][3][4][8].

Smith’s musical style was marked by a seamless blend of jazz, funk, soul, blues, and even elements of hip-hop and acid jazz. His unpredictable taste led him to record covers of artists from the Beatles to Jimi Hendrix, and his compositions often featured dramatic, cinematic qualities. Smith’s legacy endures as a pioneer of the jazz organ, a mentor and inspiration to generations of musicians, and a nine-time winner of the Jazz Journalists Association’s 'Best Organist' award[3][5].
