## Biography
Joe Liggins, born Theodro Elliott on July 9, 1916, in Seminole, Oklahoma, was a pioneering American pianist, vocalist, and bandleader whose work bridged the worlds of R&B, jazz, and blues. After moving with his family to San Diego in 1932, he adopted his stepfather's surname and pursued formal music studies at San Diego State College, performing in local bands and writing arrangements for established groups. By 1939, Liggins had relocated to Los Angeles, where he played with Sammy Franklin's California Rhythm Rascals and other ensembles, honing his skills in the vibrant nightclub scene.

In 1944, Liggins formed his own group, Joe Liggins and His Honeydrippers, after Franklin declined to record his composition "The Honeydripper." The band quickly found success, with their signature track topping the R&B charts for 18 weeks in 1945 and selling over two million copies—a record that remains tied for the longest stay at number one on the R&B chart. Liggins' music, characterized by a blend of boogie-woogie, swing, and jazz blues, played a crucial role in the evolution of postwar rhythm and blues and the early development of rock and roll. The Honeydrippers continued to chart hits through the late 1940s and 1950s, and Liggins remained active as a performer until his death in 1987, cementing his legacy as a foundational figure in American popular music.
