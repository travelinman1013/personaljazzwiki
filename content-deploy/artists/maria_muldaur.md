## Biography
Maria Muldaur, born Maria Grazia Rosa Domenica D'Amato on September 12, 1942, in New York City, emerged from the vibrant Greenwich Village folk scene of the early 1960s. She began her career with the Even Dozen Jug Band, alongside future luminaries like David Grisman and John Sebastian, before gaining prominence as the featured vocalist and occasional fiddle player in the Jim Kweskin Jug Band. After marrying fellow band member Geoff Muldaur, the duo released two albums together, further cementing her reputation in the American roots and folk revival movement.

Muldaur's solo career took off with her 1973 self-titled debut, featuring the sultry hit "Midnight at the Oasis," which reached No. 6 on the Billboard Hot 100 and garnered several Grammy nominations. While initially associated with pop and soft rock, Muldaur's musical explorations have spanned blues, gospel, jazz, R&B, and Americana. Over five decades, she has released more than 40 albums, consistently championing traditional American roots music and especially the blues, earning multiple Grammy nominations and a Lifetime Achievement Americana Trailblazer Award. Her expressive, warm vocal style and dedication to reviving classic blues—particularly the work of early female blues artists—have made her a beloved and influential figure in American music.
