## Biography
Terius Gray, better known as Juvenile, was born on March 25, 1975, in New Orleans, Louisiana, and grew up between his family's homes in the 10th Ward and the 3rd Ward Magnolia Housing Projects. A child prodigy, he began rapping at age seven after being inspired by Melle Mel's verse on Grandmaster Flash's 'The Message,' started writing professionally in his early teens, and formed the UTP crew with Uptown rappers. At 15, he recorded the first bounce track 'Bounce For The Juvenile' in 1989 for DJ Jimi's album, which led to a solo deal with Warlock Records and his debut album Being Myself in 1995 while living in housing projects.[1][2][3][5]

Juvenile's career exploded after signing with Cash Money Records in 1996, releasing Solja Rags and joining the Hot Boys group alongside Lil Wayne, B.G., and Turk. His 1998 album 400 Degreez became the top-selling album by a Black solo rapper at the time, featuring hits like 'Ha'—the first Southern rap song to achieve national airplay—and 'Back That Azz Up.' He pioneered New Orleans bounce, a high-energy style blending gangster rap and party music that influenced crunk and Southern hip-hop, with further success on Atlantic Records including the #1 hit 'Slow Motion' in 2004. Over three decades, he released 12 albums, sold over 10 million worldwide, and founded the UTP label.[1][2][5][7]

Hurricane Katrina in 2005 devastated New Orleans, destroying Juvenile's home, but he contributed to relief efforts and filmed in the Lower Ninth Ward for his music. His legacy endures as a foundational figure in Southern hip-hop, spreading New Orleans culture globally through enduring anthems and recent singles like 'Party' with Mannie Fresh.[1][2][5]
