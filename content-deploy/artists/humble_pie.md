## Biography
Humble Pie was a British blues rock band formed in 1969 in Moreton, Essex, England, by Steve Marriott (formerly of Small Faces), Peter Frampton (from The Herd), Greg Ridley (from Spooky Tooth), and Jerry Shirley (from The Apostolic Intervention). Drawing media attention as a supergroup due to the members' prior successes, they rehearsed at Marriott's cottage and signed to Immediate Records, releasing the hit single 'Natural Born Boogie' (UK #5) and albums 'As Safe As Yesterday Is' (progressive rock) and 'Town and Country' (acoustic-focused). After Immediate's collapse, they joined A&M Records in 1970, shifting to a heavier boogie rock sound with albums like 'Humble Pie' and 'Rock On,' culminating in the landmark live album 'Performance: Rockin' the Fillmore' (1971), featuring the FM radio staple 'I Don't Need No Doctor.'[1][2][3][4]

## Fun Facts
- Peter Frampton initially wanted to join Small Faces, but Steve Marriott instead asked to join Frampton's new band after leaving his group.[3]
- The band's name 'Humble Pie' was chosen to downplay supergroup hype and build slowly, countering their prior teen idol images.[1][3]
- Their 1971 live album 'Performance: Rockin' the Fillmore' was recorded before Frampton left, capturing peak energy despite his imminent departure.[1]
- Steve Marriott and Peter Frampton nearly reunited in 1991 for a new album and tour, but Marriott died in a house fire before it happened.[1]
