## Biography
Little Freddie King, born Fread Eugene Martin on July 19, 1940, in McComb, Mississippi, grew up surrounded by music in the cotton fields of his hometown. His father, Jessie James Martin, was a skilled blues guitarist, and his cousin was the legendary Lightnin’ Hopkins, both of whom deeply influenced his early musical education. After his father’s untimely death when Freddie was just seven, he began working to support his family, but music remained his passion. At age 14, driven by ambition and the lure of New Orleans, he hopped a freight train to the city, where he would eventually become a fixture in its vibrant blues scene[3][1].

King’s career developed in the tough juke joints and clubs of New Orleans, notably the infamous Busy Bee on Perdido Street during the 1960s, where he honed his raw, electrifying style amid a sometimes dangerous environment. Over decades, he became a mainstay of the city’s music culture, performing at every New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival since its inception in 1970 (missing only one year), and recording a prolific catalog beginning in 1971. His music, described as 'gut bucket blues,' blends rural Mississippi electric blues with the urban energy of New Orleans, characterized by minimalist chords, gritty vocals, and a deeply authentic sound. Despite the city’s jazz dominance, King’s blues guitar and storytelling have made him a beloved patriarch of New Orleans blues, earning him induction into the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame and a Blues Trail Marker in his Mississippi hometown[1][4][2][5].

King’s legacy is built not only on his distinctive sound and flamboyant stage presence—often featuring high kicks and a signature Gibson Flying V—but also on his resilience and authenticity. Surviving numerous hardships, including shootings, stabbings, electrocutions, and hurricanes, he remains an active performer and recording artist well into his 80s. His influence extends through his collaborations and mentorship, and his music continues to inspire new generations of blues musicians[5][2].

## Fun Facts
- Little Freddie King crafted his first guitar from a cigar box, haywire, horse hair, hickory branches, and a pine board as a child in Mississippi[3][5].
- He is one of the very few artists to have performed at every New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival since its founding in 1970[1][2].
- King survived numerous life-threatening incidents, including shootings, stabbings, electrocutions, and hurricanes, and has been sober for nearly 50 years[5].
- He is known for his flamboyant stage outfits and energetic performances, often featuring high kicks and his trademark Gibson Flying V guitar[2][5].
