## Biography
Charlie Parker (1920-1955), nicknamed 'Bird,' was born in Kansas City, Kansas, to Charles and Addie Parker, and raised there until age seven when his family moved. He became a pioneering alto saxophonist, bandleader, and composer, central to bebop's development alongside Dizzy Gillespie. Parker's early career included playing with Jay McShann's band in 1940, where he met Gillespie, and later Earl Hines' orchestra, fostering bebop innovations through complex harmonies, rapid tempos, and virtuosic improvisation[1][2]. Dizzy Gillespie (1917-1993), born John Birks Gillespie, grew up immersed in jazz, playing in bands led by Roy Eldridge, Cab Calloway, and others before meeting Parker around 1940, confirming his experimental ideas[3][5]. Together, they jammed at Minton's Playhouse, revolutionizing jazz with bebop[1][3].

Their partnership peaked in 1945 after the AFM recording ban lifted, producing seminal tracks like 'Ko-Ko,' 'Billie's Bounce,' 'Groovin' High,' 'Salt Peanuts,' and 'Hot House' with collaborators including Miles Davis and Max Roach. Parker and Gillespie formed integrated small groups without guitar, freeing solos from rhythmic constraints, and recorded the landmark 'Bird and Diz' album in 1950 with Thelonious Monk. Gillespie led big bands popularizing bebop and Afro-Cuban jazz, while Parker mentored emerging talents amid personal struggles with heroin[2][3][5]. They reunited for events like the 1953 Massey Hall concert until Parker's death[3].

Their legacy transformed jazz from swing to bebop, influencing generations with advanced harmonics, rhythms, and ornamentation. Parker's improvisational breakthroughs, like reimagining 'Cherokee,' and Gillespie's trumpet virtuosity and Latin fusions set new standards, as Quincy Jones noted their rule-breaking impact on American music[1][2].

## Fun Facts
- Parker earned his 'Bird' nickname after requesting a 'yardbird' (chicken) at a meal, which Gillespie and others shortened[2].
- Gillespie was fired from Cab Calloway's band for a prank involving a spitball with a lit match inside[5].
- Their 1945 Town Hall concert was rediscovered in 2004 and released in 2005[2].
- Parker's 1945 Savoy session with Gillespie and Davis is called the 'greatest jazz session ever'[2].
