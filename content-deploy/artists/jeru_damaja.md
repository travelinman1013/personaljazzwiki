## Biography
Jeru the Damaja, born Kendrick Jeru Davis in the East New York section of Brooklyn, New York, began writing rhymes at the age of ten, drawing inspiration from the gritty street life surrounding him. He adopted the persona 'the Damaja' for his mic-damaging flow, blending conscious lyricism with hardcore Brooklyn edge. In high school, he connected with Guru and DJ Premier of Gang Starr in the late 1980s, debuting his 'hardcore conscious' style on their 1992 track 'I'm the Man' from *Daily Operation*.[1][2][3]

His breakthrough came in 1993-1994 with the DJ Premier-produced single 'Come Clean' and debut album *The Sun Rises in the East* on Payday Records, hailed as one of the greatest hip-hop albums ever for its raw critique of rap's commercialization. He followed with *Wrath of the Math* (1996), featuring hits like 'Ya Playin' Yaself' and 'Me or the Papes,' positioning himself as a hip-hop savior akin to KRS-One. Later independent releases like *Heroz 4 Hire* (2000) on his KnowSavage Records, *Still Risin'* (2007), and planned EP *The Hammer* showcased his evolution, fusing life experiences with rugged production.[1][2][3]

Known for relentless global touring across the US, Europe, South America, Asia, and Africa, Jeru has expanded into collaborations, video game soundtracks (*Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 4*, *GTA IV*), skateboarding with DC Shoes, and photography exhibitions. His outspoken style, criticizing figures like Puffy and the Fugees, cemented his legacy as a principled East Coast boom bap voice.[1][3][4][5]
