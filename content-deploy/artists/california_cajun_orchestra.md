## Biography
The California Cajun Orchestra (CCO) formed in the early 1980s in the San Francisco Bay Area as an offshoot of the eclectic acoustic Blue Flame Stringband, evolving into one of the most powerful Cajun dance bands on the West Coast. The band was led by accordionist and singer Danny Poullard, born and raised in Eunice, Louisiana, who moved with his family to Beaumont, Texas at age thirteen and later settled in the Bay Area in 1961. Poullard inherited his love of music from his father, John, an accordion player, and became immersed in California's Cajun scene after connecting with accordionist John Semien and fiddler Ben Guillory, who encouraged him to take up the accordion seriously[1][3][6][7].

Poullard's career developed through traditional house dances, church halls, and private clubs, where he joined the Louisiana Playboys (formerly the Opelousas Playboys) following internal band conflicts and Semien's temporary return to Louisiana. After leading the Playboys and overcoming personal health challenges, including triple bypass surgery in 1978, Poullard transitioned to the newly formed CCO around 1982, solidifying its reputation for authentic Cajun and Creole music west of Texas[1][3]. The band's style drew from traditional Louisiana influences, blending accordion-driven dance tunes with fiddle, guitar, rub-board, bass, and drums to power West Coast Cajun revival scenes.

Active through the 1980s and 1990s, the CCO released recordings like the 1991 Arhoolie album 'California Cajun,' produced by Jody Stecher and Suzy Thompson, and performed at events such as the Western Regional Folklife Festival. Poullard's passing marked the end of an era, but the band's legacy endures in preserving Cajun traditions among West Coast musicians[3][7].

## Fun Facts
- The band originated from the Blue Flame Stringband and grew by sitting in at Bay Area Cajun dances before becoming a standalone powerhouse[3].
- Danny Poullard suggested renaming the Louisiana Playboys because no members, including former leader John Semien, were actually from Opelousas[1].
- After heart surgery in 1978, Poullard recovered quickly and reassembled with the band that summer, continuing his influential career[1].
- The CCO featured Poullard as the only authentic Louisiana-born Cajun member, preserving traditions from Eunice via his father's accordion legacy[3][6].
