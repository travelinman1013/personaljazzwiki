## Biography
The Harold Mabern Trio centers around the legendary American jazz pianist Harold Mabern Jr. (1936–2019), a pivotal figure in hard bop, post-bop, and soul jazz. Born in Memphis, Tennessee, Mabern was initially a drummer before switching to piano, inspired by local greats like Phineas Newborn Jr. and Charles Thomas. After high school, he moved to Chicago in 1954, immersing himself in the city’s vibrant jazz scene, performing with Walter Perkins’ MJT + 3, and absorbing influences from Ahmad Jamal and others. 

Mabern’s career flourished as he moved to New York City in 1959, quickly becoming a sought-after sideman and leader. He played with jazz luminaries such as Art Farmer, Benny Golson, Lee Morgan, and Wes Montgomery, and began recording as a leader in 1968 with the album 'A Few Miles from Memphis.' Throughout his career, Mabern was known for his powerful, blues-infused piano style, encyclopedic repertoire, and deep commitment to jazz education, teaching at William Paterson University and mentoring many younger musicians. His trio, especially in later years, often featured bassist John Webber and drummer Joe Farnsworth, with frequent collaborations with saxophonist Eric Alexander. Mabern’s legacy endures through his recordings, his influence on generations of jazz musicians, and his central role in the New York jazz community, particularly at venues like Smoke Jazz Club.
