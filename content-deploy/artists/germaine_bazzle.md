## Biography
Germaine Bazzle, born March 28, 1932, in New Orleans’ culturally vibrant Seventh Ward, is celebrated as one of the city’s preeminent jazz vocalists and a revered music educator. Raised in a musical family, she began playing piano by ear as a child and received formal training at the Xavier Junior School of Music at age twelve. Bazzle’s early exposure to the rich musical traditions of New Orleans, coupled with her classical studies at Xavier University of Louisiana, shaped her versatile approach to music, spanning jazz, standards, and classical repertoire.

After graduating, Bazzle embarked on a dual career as a performer and educator. She taught choir and music appreciation at Xavier University Preparatory School, where she inspired generations of students, while also performing in New Orleans nightclubs and collaborating with jazz luminaries such as Ellis Marsalis, Alvin "Red" Tyler, and Victor Goines. Renowned for her sophisticated scat singing and her ability to treat her voice as an instrument, Bazzle became a fixture in the city’s jazz scene, leading her own group, Germaine Bazzle & Friends, and performing with ensembles like the Saint Louis Catholic Choir and The New World Ensemble. Her dedication to both performance and teaching earned her numerous accolades, including OffBeat’s Lifetime Achievement in Music Education award and multiple Big Easy Music Awards.

Bazzle’s musical style is marked by her mastery of vocal jazz, particularly scat singing, and her deep appreciation for both vocal and instrumental jazz traditions. Though she chose not to tour extensively, preferring to remain rooted in New Orleans to focus on teaching, her influence has been profound—shaping the city’s jazz landscape and mentoring countless young musicians through her work at the Louis Armstrong Jazz Camp and beyond. Her legacy endures as the "First Lady of New Orleans Jazz," a title reflecting her artistry, mentorship, and lifelong commitment to the music of her hometown.
