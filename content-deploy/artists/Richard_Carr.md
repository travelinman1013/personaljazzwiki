## Biography
Richard Carr is an American pianist, composer, and improviser, born and raised in St. Louis, Missouri in the early 1960s. He began piano lessons at age six, developing a strong foundation in classical music before branching into improvisation by age eleven. Throughout his youth and college years, Carr explored a variety of instruments, including French horn, euphonium, trumpet, and mallet percussion, but ultimately focused on piano, pipe organ, and synthesizers as his primary instruments. 

Carr's career took a pivotal turn in 1995 when he moved to New Orleans, Louisiana, initially for a university job, but soon transitioned to being a full-time musician. He became a prominent figure in the New Orleans music scene, not only as a performer and composer but also as a community organizer, hosting 'The Original Music Series' to showcase local talent and support musicians' health initiatives. His musical style is characterized by a blend of classical influences, jazz improvisation, and contemporary minimalism, drawing inspiration from artists such as Keith Jarrett, George Winston, John Adams, Steve Reich, and groups like Tangerine Dream. Carr's works, including albums like 'Fogland' and 'When Soul and Heart Collide,' are noted for their emotional depth and innovative harmonic language, earning him a dedicated following among fans of solo piano and new age music.
