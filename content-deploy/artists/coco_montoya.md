## Biography
Henry "Coco" Montoya, born October 2, 1951 in Santa Monica, California, is an acclaimed American blues guitarist and vocalist of Mexican heritage. Raised in a working-class family, Montoya was exposed to a wide range of music through his parents' record collection, including big band jazz, salsa, doo-wop, and rock 'n' roll. He began his musical journey as a drummer, acquiring his first kit at age 11 and playing in local rock bands during his teens. A transformative experience came in 1969 when he saw Albert King perform, inspiring him to pursue blues music.

Montoya's career took a pivotal turn in the mid-1970s when he met legendary bluesman Albert Collins, who hired him as a drummer and became his mentor. Under Collins' guidance, Montoya transitioned to guitar, developing a distinctive left-handed, upside-down playing style and emotional phrasing. After five years with Collins, Montoya joined John Mayall's Bluesbreakers in the early 1980s, touring and recording with the band for a decade alongside fellow guitarist Walter Trout. This period solidified his reputation as a dynamic blues performer.

Launching his solo career in 1993, Montoya quickly gained recognition for his passionate vocals and inventive guitar work. His debut album, "Gotta Mind To Travel" (1995), was met with critical acclaim and fan enthusiasm, earning him the Blues Music Award for Best New Artist in 1996. Over the following decades, Montoya released numerous albums, toured internationally, and became a leading figure in modern blues and blues rock, celebrated for blending fiery intensity with heartfelt soul.
