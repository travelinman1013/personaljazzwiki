## Biography
Ernestine Anderson (November 11, 1928 – March 10, 2016) was an acclaimed American jazz and blues vocalist whose career spanned more than six decades. Born in Houston, Texas, Anderson was immersed in music from an early age, singing along to her parents’ blues records and performing gospel solos at her grandmother’s church. Her family relocated to Seattle when she was 16, where she quickly became a fixture in the city’s vibrant jazz scene, performing with the Junior Band led by 'Bumps' Blackwell and sharing the stage with future legends like Quincy Jones and Ray Charles.

Anderson’s professional breakthrough came in the 1950s, touring with Johnny Otis and Lionel Hampton before recording her debut album 'Hot Cargo' in Sweden in 1956. The album’s U.S. release in 1958 garnered critical acclaim, with jazz critic Ralph J. Gleason calling her 'the best new jazz singer in a decade.' She went on to perform at major venues and festivals worldwide, including Carnegie Hall and the Monterey Jazz Festival, and recorded over 30 albums. Despite challenges during the rock-dominated 1960s, Anderson experienced a resurgence in the 1970s and 1980s, earning four Grammy nominations and solidifying her reputation as one of jazz’s leading vocalists.

Known for her impeccable phrasing, warm tone, and ability to infuse songs with storytelling depth, Anderson left a lasting legacy on both jazz and blues. She was celebrated as 'Seattle’s First Lady of Jazz' and inspired generations of musicians with her artistry and resilience.
