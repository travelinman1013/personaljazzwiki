## Biography
Lianne La Havas, born Lianne Charlotte Barnes on August 23, 1989, in London, England, is a British singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist celebrated for her blend of soul, alternative R&B, and pop soul. Raised in Tooting and Streatham by her Greek father and Jamaican mother, La Havas was deeply influenced by her parents’ diverse musical backgrounds—her father, a multi-instrumentalist, taught her the basics of guitar and piano, while her mother exposed her to soul and R&B. She began singing at age seven, wrote her first song at eleven, and sang in her school choir, though she did not learn guitar properly until she was eighteen[1][2][3].

La Havas’s musical journey began in earnest after meeting musicians in college, leading to her involvement in the duo The Paris Parade and later singing backup for Paloma Faith. Discovered on Myspace in 2008, she signed with Warner Bros. Records in 2010 and spent two years honing her songwriting before releasing her debut EPs and her acclaimed first album, 'Is Your Love Big Enough?' in 2012, which was named iTunes Album of the Year. She has since released two more albums: 'Blood' (2015), inspired by her heritage and travels to Jamaica, and the self-titled 'Lianne La Havas' (2020). Her career is marked by collaborations with artists like Prince and Rudimental, and she has been nominated for Grammy and Brit Awards, establishing herself as a distinctive voice in contemporary British music[1][2][3][4].

La Havas’s music is characterized by its soulful vocals, intricate guitar work, and introspective songwriting, blending influences from folk, soul, and pop. Her legacy includes not only critical acclaim and festival appearances but also a reputation for authenticity and emotional depth, inspiring a new generation of soul and R&B artists[1][2][3].
