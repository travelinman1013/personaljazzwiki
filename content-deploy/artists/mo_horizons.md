## Biography
Mo' Horizons is a German acid jazz duo formed in the late 1990s in Hannover, Niedersachsen, Germany, by producers, musicians, and DJs Ralf Droesemeyer and Mark 'Foh' Wetzler. Both hailing from Hannover, Ralf was already renowned for his production work with artists like Cunnie Williams and Randy Crawford, while Foh was known as an ultra-active record collector and PC musician. Seeking to expand their DJ sets with original music blending influences from the soulful 1950s and 1960s, funky 1970s, up to the 1990s, they experimented and created their debut singles 'Yes Baby Yes (Sally Said)' and 'Foto Viva,' leading to their first album, *Come Touch the Sun*, released in 1999 on Stereo Deluxe records.[1][2][3]

The duo's career progressed rapidly with *Remember Tomorrow* in 2001, which fused Brazil, Latin, jazz, soul, Afro, funk, and elements from the 1950s to 1990s, supported by multicultural live musicians. In 2002, they debuted as a full live band, touring internationally to countries including Italy, Greece, Spain, Austria, Switzerland, South America, and Australia, gathering new sounds along the way. Their 2003 album *...And the New Bohemian Freedom* pushed boundaries further, accompanied by their first video single 'Gonna Be.' By 2005, they released the compilation *Some More Horizons*, remixing obscure tracks from the 1950s-1970s with their own compositions, followed by *StereoDeluxe 150*. Transitioning to their own label, Agogo Records (founded with Ralf Zitzmann's help), they focused on new music and talent scouting, with later releases like *Sunshine Today* in 2007.[1][2][3]

Mo' Horizons' musical style is characterized by acid jazz, nu jazz, funk, jazz, bossa nova, soul, boogaloo, downbeat, and drum'n'bass, often featured on over 500 compilations worldwide, commercials, and TV shows. Active since 1999, they continue touring as a DJ team and soundsystem with guest musicians, maintaining their innovative fusion that broke musical boundaries and set standards for clubs and radios.[1][2][3]
