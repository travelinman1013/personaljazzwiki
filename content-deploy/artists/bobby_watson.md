## Biography
Bobby Watson, born Robert Michael Watson Jr. on August 23, 1953, in Lawrence, Kansas, and raised in Kansas City, Kansas, is a celebrated American jazz saxophonist, composer, bandleader, and educator. Inspired early by his father, who played saxophone and worked for the FAA, Watson's musical journey was shaped by a formative jazz history class in junior high and formal studies at the University of Miami, where he learned alongside future jazz luminaries such as Pat Metheny and Jaco Pastorius. Graduating in 1975, Watson moved to New York City and quickly established himself, becoming the musical director for Art Blakey’s Jazz Messengers from 1977 to 1981—a tenure during which he contributed to more recordings than any other member in the band's storied history.

Following his years with Blakey, Watson became a prolific session musician and collaborator, working with jazz greats including Max Roach, Louis Hayes, George Coleman, Branford Marsalis, Wynton Marsalis, Joe Williams, Dianne Reeves, Lou Rawls, and Betty Carter. In the mid-1980s, he formed the acclaimed group Bobby Watson & Horizon with Curtis Lundy and Victor Lewis, creating a modern, hard bop sound that garnered critical acclaim and produced several classic albums for Blue Note and Columbia. Watson also led ensembles such as the High Court of Swing, the Tailor-Made Big Band, and the 29th Street Saxophone Quartet, and composed for film, notably contributing to the soundtrack of 'A Bronx Tale.'

A dedicated educator, Watson taught at William Paterson University, the Manhattan School of Music, and, most notably, served as Director of Jazz Studies at the University of Missouri–Kansas City Conservatory from 2000 until his retirement in 2020. His influence as a teacher and performer has helped shape the next generation of jazz musicians, and his legacy is cemented by numerous honors, including induction into the Kansas Music Hall of Fame and the American Jazz Walk of Fame. Watson continues to perform and record, celebrated for his intelligent, soulful approach to jazz and his enduring commitment to the music's evolution.
