## Biography
Big Leon Brooks (November 19, 1933 – January 22, 1982) was a distinguished harmonica player and vocalist whose career bridged the classic and modern eras of Chicago blues. Born in Sunflower, Mississippi, Brooks began playing harmonica at the age of six, learning from local masters and absorbing influences from the radio. Moving to Chicago in the early 1940s, he immersed himself in the vibrant Maxwell Street scene, playing with neighborhood musicians and eventually sitting in with the Muddy Waters band at The Zanzibar club while still a teenager[2][6].

Throughout the 1950s, Brooks played alongside blues legends such as Freddie King, Jimmy Lee Robinson, and joined Jimmy Rogers’ band before forming his own group. His style, characterized by a deep voice and heavy harmonica tone, remained rooted in the classic Chicago blues tradition, largely unaffected by the guitar-driven trends of the 1960s and 1970s. Disenchanted by these changes, Brooks retired from music in the early '60s, working as a truck driver and playing harmonica only at home[1][2].

Brooks made a celebrated comeback in 1976, prompted by encouragement from old friends and younger musicians who revered his authentic sound. He performed with Tail Dragger and his own band, recorded for Alligator’s Living Chicago Blues series, and cut his only full-length album, "Let’s Go To Town." Despite recurring heart problems that limited his performing opportunities, Brooks left a lasting legacy as a torchbearer of classic Chicago blues harmonica, inspiring a new generation of musicians before his untimely death in Chicago at age 48[1][2][3].
