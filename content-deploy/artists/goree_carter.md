## Biography
Goree Carter was born on December 31, 1930, in Houston, Texas, and grew up in the city’s vibrant Fifth Ward. Raised in a musical family—his father was a blues pianist—Carter was surrounded by music from an early age. He taught himself guitar at age 12, learning by ear from records and local musicians, and was soon performing with older artists in Houston’s bustling blues scene. By his late teens, Carter had developed a distinctive, energetic guitar style influenced by jump blues and the electric innovations of T-Bone Walker.

At just 18, Carter signed with Freedom Records, fronting his own band, The Hepcats. In 1949, he recorded the seminal track "Rock Awhile," which is now recognized as a precursor to rock and roll for its driving rhythm and electrifying guitar work—predating Chuck Berry’s signature sound. Despite local success and further recordings for labels like Imperial, Coral, and Modern, Carter’s career was hampered by poor distribution and lack of major label support. After Freedom Records folded in the early 1950s, he continued to perform locally but faded from the national spotlight, working outside music while occasionally playing gigs in Houston.

Carter’s musical style fused jump blues, Texas shuffle, and jazz phrasing, marked by crisp, bright guitar leads and innovative chord progressions. Though his national fame was brief, his pioneering electric guitar work influenced the evolution of rhythm and blues and rock and roll. Today, Carter is celebrated as an overlooked but foundational figure in American music history, whose early recordings—especially "Rock Awhile"—helped shape the sound of modern rock guitar.
