## Biography
Willie Lee Brown, born on August 6, 1900 near Clarksdale, Mississippi, was one of the pioneering figures of the Mississippi Delta blues. The son of sharecroppers, Brown grew up in the rural South, where he honed his guitar skills on plantations in Sunflower County. Known for his quiet demeanor and diminutive stature, he was often called 'Little Willie Brown' to distinguish him from another bluesman, Big Willie Brown. Brown developed a distinctive guitar style marked by a 'slapping of the first bass string,' and he preferred to play as a sideman rather than a frontman, rarely singing while performing. His musical career began in earnest after World War I, when he and fellow guitarist Willie Moore formed an itinerant duo, entertaining audiences on plantations and street corners. Brown's association with legendary bluesmen Charley Patton and Son House was central to his career, and he accompanied them on recording sessions for Paramount Records in the late 1920s and early 1930s. He recorded several sides under his own name, including 'M & O Blues' and 'Future Blues,' and continued to perform with House and others until the 1940s. After his last known recordings with Alan Lomax for the Library of Congress in 1941, Brown returned to sharecropping and died on December 30, 1952, from complications related to alcoholism.

Brown's legacy as a guitarist and sideman is significant, though he remains less celebrated than some of his contemporaries. His subtle, supportive playing style influenced the development of Delta blues, and his recordings are considered essential to the genre's history. Brown's impact is evident in the work of later blues musicians, and his name is mentioned in Robert Johnson's 'Cross Road Blues,' though it is unclear which Willie Brown Johnson was referencing. Despite his quiet personality and reluctance to seek the spotlight, Brown's contributions to the blues have been recognized as foundational to the genre.
