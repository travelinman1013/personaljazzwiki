## Biography
Peetie Wheatstraw, born William Bunch on December 21, 1902, in Ripley, Tennessee (though some sources cite Cotton Plant, Arkansas), emerged as one of the most prolific and influential blues artists of the prewar era. He moved to East St. Louis, Illinois, in the late 1920s, where he quickly became a fixture on the local scene, performing at clubs like Lovejoy and a juke joint above a barbershop. Initially a proficient guitarist, Wheatstraw soon focused on piano, developing a distinctive, idiosyncratic style that made him a favorite among urban African American audiences[2][3].

Wheatstraw began recording in 1930, aided by blues musician Charley Jordan, and continued to release music throughout the Great Depression, a period when blues recordings were otherwise scarce. Over his career, he recorded more than 160 sides for labels such as Vocalion, Decca, and Bluebird, making him one of the most recorded blues singers of his time. His lyrics often addressed social issues, urban life, and supernatural themes, and his trademark "Ooh, well well" vocal phrase became widely imitated. Wheatstraw's popularity in St. Louis and East St. Louis rivaled that of Walter Davis, and his influence extended well beyond his immediate circle[2][4][6].

Wheatstraw's legacy is marked by his colorful persona, famously billing himself as "The Devil’s Son-in-Law" and "The High Sheriff from Hell." His music blended country blues, classic blues, and ragtime, and his playful approach to dark themes set him apart from contemporaries. He died tragically in a car accident on his 39th birthday, December 21, 1941, but his impact on blues music—especially through his lyrics and persona—remains significant[2][4][6].
