## Biography
Little Beaver, born Willie George Hale on August 15, 1945, in Forrest City, Arkansas, is a celebrated American soul, funk, and R&B guitarist, singer, and songwriter. Nicknamed 'Little Beaver' as a child for his prominent teeth, Hale developed into a virtuoso guitarist early on, moving to Florida in the 1960s where he became a key figure in the Miami soul scene. His career began with session work for TK Records, notably contributing his distinctive guitar sound to Betty Wright’s hit 'Clean Up Woman,' and recording singles with his band, the Rocketeers, for Frank Williams' Saadia label and Phil L.A. of Soul.[1][2][3][5][6][8]

Hale’s solo career flourished in the 1970s after signing with the Cat label, an offshoot of TK Records. He released several albums, including 'Joey,' 'Party Down,' and 'When Was the Last Time,' blending soulful vocals with funk-infused guitar rhythms. His biggest hit, 'Party Down,' reached #2 on the Billboard R&B chart in 1974, and his music was characterized by emotional depth, groove-driven arrangements, and a unique Miami sound. Despite the commercial decline of soul and funk during the disco era, Little Beaver’s innovative style and technical prowess secured his legacy as a pioneering artist, with later works and reissues continuing to attract new listeners.[2][3][4][5][6]

Little Beaver’s influence extends beyond his own recordings; he collaborated with numerous Florida R&B musicians, including Benny Latimore, Timmy Thomas, and bassist Jaco Pastorius. His session work, songwriting, and guitar style have inspired generations of musicians, and his contributions to albums by artists such as Betty Wright and Joss Stone highlight his enduring relevance in soul and R&B. His legacy is marked by a blend of blues, soul, funk, and Latin influences, making him a foundational figure in the development of the Miami sound.[3][4][5]
