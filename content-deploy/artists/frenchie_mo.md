## Biography
Frenchie Moe is a French-born blues guitarist, singer, and songwriter based in New Orleans, Louisiana, known for fusing modern Chicago grit with Crescent City R&B fire.[1][2] Born in France in 1986, she discovered the blues at the age of eight after seeing English bluesman Victor Brox perform, an experience that convinced her she wanted to dedicate her life to the music.[1][2] Brox became a key mentor, inviting her into his band; by twelve she was already performing on stage, and by fifteen she was fronting her first serious band in France.[1][2] Deeply moved by the history and emotional power of the blues, she immersed herself in the genre’s African‑American roots and resolved to pursue it in its country of origin.[1]

At nineteen, Moe moved to the United States, spending several years in the Midwest working odd jobs while trying to break into the local music scene.[1][2] During this period she was mentored by guitarist Creighton Holley, a former member of the Chicago Rhythm Kings, who helped sharpen her sound and stagecraft.[1][2] In 2011 she relocated to her dream city of New Orleans, where she formed new bands and began collaborating with Louisiana Music Hall of Famers Coco Robicheaux and Walter “Wolfman” Washington, deepening her connection to Southern soul, R&B, and roots blues.[1][2] Her music—showcased on releases such as the album “Soul Full Tonight” (2023) and the New Orleans blues statement “Hi Class” (2025)—ranges from slow, smoldering blues to funky, danceable grooves, threaded together by soulful vocals, high‑voltage guitar work, and an evident reverence for overlooked B‑sides and lesser‑known artists from the 1950s to 1970s.[1][2]

Moe’s style blends modern electric blues with the rhythmic swagger and horn‑driven feel of New Orleans R&B, often described as both velvety and dangerous, yet capable of intimate tenderness.[1][2] Her live sets move fluidly from blues standards to old‑school R&B and original compositions, with an emphasis on tone, feel, and groove.[1][2] She has become known not only for preserving the blues tradition but for updating it—re‑arranging obscure material, spotlighting under‑recognized songs and musicians, and ensuring the blues remains vibrant, contemporary, and emotionally resonant for diverse audiences in Louisiana and beyond.[1][2]
