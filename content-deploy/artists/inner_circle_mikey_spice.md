## Biography
Michael Theophilus Johnson, known as Mikey Spice, was born on July 21, 1965, in Kingston, Jamaica. He began his musical journey singing in his father's church at age seven and by 13 had mastered instruments including guitar, bass, drums, trumpet, piano, saxophone, flute, harp, and clarinet, eventually becoming proficient in 22 instruments.[1][2][3] His early career involved performing with various bands, where his soulful voice drew comparisons to Lou Rawls, before launching a solo reggae path in 1985.[1][2]

Mikey Spice rose to prominence in the 1990s with hits like his 1995 debut album *Happiness* and the Barry White cover *Practice What You Preach*, earning best new artist and song of the year awards in 1995, plus number-one status in Miami and London.[1][2] He delivered standout performances at Reggae Sunsplash in 1993 and Sting, sharing stages with icons like Gregory Isaacs, Dennis Brown, and Freddie McGregor, while also producing tracks such as *More Than Wonderful* and the album *Harder Than Before* (VP Records, 2000).[1][2] His style blends conscious roots reggae, lovers rock, and R&B elements.[2]

Despite a decorated career with albums like *Walk A Mile* (2008) and *I Am I Said* (2014), Mikey Spice remains underrecognized today, though his multi-instrumentalist talents and enduring hits continue to influence reggae fans worldwide.[1][2]
