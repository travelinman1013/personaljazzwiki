## Biography
The Benny Lackner Trio is the longstanding main vehicle for German‑American jazz pianist and composer Benny (Benjamin) Lackner, who was born in Berlin in 1976 and moved to California as a teenager before later basing himself between New York and Berlin.[3][9] Lackner formed the trio in New York City in 2002, originally featuring himself on piano and electronics with Jérôme Regard on bass and Matthieu Chazarenc on drums, and the group quickly became the core setting in which he developed his voice as a bandleader and composer.[2][3] Drawing on his transatlantic background, he built a repertoire that blends European lyricism with a distinctly American jazz education, touring widely and gradually gaining recognition on the international club and festival circuit.[5][9]

Over the years, the Benny Lackner Trio has focused on original compositions that emphasize melody, atmosphere, and subtle rhythmic drive, often incorporating electronic textures while remaining rooted in acoustic piano‑trio interplay.[2][4][5] Critics have noted Lackner’s laid‑back, lyrical approach at the piano and a modern sensibility that can reference rock and contemporary artists alongside the jazz tradition, giving the trio’s music a forward‑looking character that still respects classic piano‑trio values.[4][5][7] The trio has also served as a springboard for Lackner’s later projects on labels such as ECM, where he expanded into larger ensemble formats, but the piano‑bass‑drums setting remains central to his artistic identity and legacy.[3][8][9]

## Fun Facts
- Benny Lackner was born in Berlin to an American father and a German mother and then relocated to California at 13, giving the trio’s leader a bicultural background that colors the group’s European‑American aesthetic.[6]
- Before focusing on his own trio, Lackner completed formal jazz studies in the United States, including a BFA from the California Institute of the Arts, which anchored the trio’s modern harmonic and rhythmic foundation.[6]
- Lackner has cited rock and pop figures such as Radiohead, Prince, and David Bowie alongside jazz icons like Thelonious Monk and Charles Mingus as inspirations, an eclectic mix that helps explain the trio’s contemporary sound palette.[7]
- Even after expanding into larger ECM projects with horns and international all‑star lineups, Lackner continues to return to the trio format as a laboratory for new material and a distilled expression of his compositional voice.[3][8]
