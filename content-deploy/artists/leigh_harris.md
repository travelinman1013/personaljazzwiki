## Biography
Leigh Harris, best known by her stage name 'Little Queenie,' was born on July 27, 1954, in New Orleans, Louisiana. Raised in Old Metairie, she was immersed in music from an early age—her father was a clarinetist with a passion for Big Band and Dixieland, and her mother was an educator and director of a local school. Harris began singing as a toddler and performed publicly by age 11, quickly developing a love for rock and roll after seeing the Beatles at age 10. By her teens, she was writing folk songs and performing at local festivals.

Harris became a defining figure in the New Orleans music scene in the 1970s, adopting the moniker 'Little Queenie' in 1975. She co-founded the influential band Li'l Queenie and the Percolators with keyboardist John Magnie, performing regularly at legendary venues like Tipitina's and Jimmy's Music Club. The group blended soul, funk, jazz, and New Orleans R&B, and their song 'My Darlin' New Orleans' became an enduring local anthem, later featured in the HBO series 'Treme.' After the Percolators disbanded in 1982, Harris continued her career with a variety of projects, including bluegrass and vocal ensembles, and released four solo albums. She was celebrated for her vocal range, stage presence, and genre-defying artistry, collaborating with many of New Orleans' musical greats.

Throughout her four-decade career, Harris was revered not only as a performer but also as a mentor and inspiration to younger musicians. Her openness, humor, and generosity left a lasting mark on the New Orleans music community. Harris passed away in 2019 at the age of 65, leaving behind a legacy as one of the city's most dynamic and influential voices.
