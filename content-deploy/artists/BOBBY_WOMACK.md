## Biography
Bobby Womack, born Robert Dwayne Womack on March 4, 1944, in Cleveland, Ohio, emerged from a deeply musical family and began performing as a child with his brothers in the gospel group The Womack Brothers. Their talent caught the attention of soul legend Sam Cooke, who became their mentor and signed them to his SAR Records label, later renaming them The Valentinos. Under Cooke’s guidance, the group transitioned from gospel to secular music, achieving early R&B success with hits like 'Lookin’ for a Love' and 'It’s All Over Now,' the latter famously covered by The Rolling Stones.[1][2]

After Sam Cooke’s death in 1964, Womack’s career shifted as he became an in-demand session guitarist and songwriter, contributing to recordings by Aretha Franklin, Wilson Pickett, and Janis Joplin, among others. He launched his solo career in the late 1960s, scoring hits with soulful, emotionally charged songs such as 'That’s the Way I Feel About Cha,' 'Woman’s Gotta Have It,' and 'Across 110th Street.' His style blended gospel roots, gritty soul, and R&B, marked by his expressive baritone and lean guitar work. Despite personal struggles, including battles with addiction, Womack experienced a resurgence in the 1980s with albums like 'The Poet,' and remained influential, collaborating with artists across genres, including Damon Albarn of Gorillaz in his later years.[2][3]

Womack’s legacy as one of soul music’s great innovators is cemented by his Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction in 2009. His music, characterized by raw honesty and musical versatility, has inspired generations of artists and continues to resonate through samples, covers, and tributes in contemporary music.[2][3]
