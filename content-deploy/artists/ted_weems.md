## Biography
Wilfred Theodore Wemyes, known professionally as **Ted Weems**, was born on September 26, 1901, in Pitcairn, Pennsylvania, USA.[1][4][5] Originally intending to become a civil engineer, he attended the University of Pennsylvania, where he and his brother Art organized a campus dance band that evolved into the famed “All American Band,” drawing top collegiate players and securing engagements at leading hotels across the United States.[1][2] Their growing reputation led to a contract at a Philadelphia restaurant—extended from four weeks to four months after the owner made Weems a partner—and an appearance at President Warren G. Harding’s inaugural ball in 1921, cementing his decision to turn professional in 1923.[1][2][3] Weems began touring under MCA management and recording for the Victor Talking Machine Company, scoring an early major success when “Somebody Stole My Gal” became a number‑one hit in 1924 and sold over one million copies, earning a gold disc.[1][2][3]

Through the late 1920s and 1930s, Weems developed one of the most popular and distinctive American dance orchestras, moving his base to Chicago around 1928 and cultivating a light‑hearted jazz‑novelty big‑band style that balanced solid musicianship with catchy, humorous arrangements.[1][3][4] His orchestra earned further hits with the novelty tune “Piccolo Pete” (his second gold record) and the number‑one song “The Man from the South” in 1929, while his radio presence expanded via major network shows such as Jack Benny’s Canada Dry program in the early 1930s, Fibber McGee & Molly in the late 1930s, and the quiz show Beat the Band in 1940.[1][3] Weems recorded extensively for Victor/RCA Victor (including Bluebird), Columbia, Decca, and later Mercury, and he also co‑wrote several pieces, including “The Martins and the McCoys,” “Jig Time,” “The One‑Man Band,” “Three Shif’less Skonks,” and “Oh, Monah!” (with band member “Country” Washburn), further reinforcing his role as both bandleader and composer.[1][2][3]

In November 1942, Weems and his entire orchestra enlisted in the United States Merchant Marine, where he directed the Merchant Marine Band during World War II before reorganizing his big band in 1945 and cutting new sides for Mercury such as “Peg O’ My Heart” and “Mickey.”[1][3][8] His greatest commercial triumph came unexpectedly in the postwar era, when a 1938 Decca recording of “Heartaches” was rediscovered and heavily played by a North Carolina disc jockey; the reissued single topped national charts for thirteen weeks in 1947 and revived his career at a moment when he was struggling to rebuild his ensemble after the war, with some former sidemen lost in service or otherwise retired.[1][3][8] Weems, who helped launch and shape the careers of future stars like Perry Como and Marilyn Maxwell and featured distinctive performers such as whistler Elmo Tanner and saxophonist‑vocalist Red Ingle, left a lasting mark on American popular and big‑band music, recognized with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame before his death on May 6, 1963.[1][2][3][5]

## Fun Facts
- Ted Weems originally planned to be a civil engineer and only turned fully to music after the college band he formed with his brother became so successful that it was in constant demand at top hotels nationwide.[1][2]
- Before he was a household name, Ted Weems’s orchestra was chosen to play at the inaugural ball of U.S. President Warren G. Harding in March 1921, giving the young bandleader a prestigious early showcase.[1][2][3]
- Weems and his entire orchestra enlisted together in the United States Merchant Marine in November 1942, serving as the Merchant Marine Band during World War II rather than continuing on the commercial bandstand.[1][3][8]
- His biggest hit, “Heartaches,” only became a smash nearly a decade after it was recorded: a disc jockey’s rediscovery of the 1938 Decca side led to a 1947 reissue that stayed at number one for 13 weeks and dramatically revived Weems’s career.[1][3][8]
