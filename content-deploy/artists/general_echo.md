## Biography
Earl Anthony Robinson, known as General Echo, was born on December 8, 1955, in Kingston, Jamaica, with sources citing locations including Maiden Lane or Fletcher's Land. His father died when he was young, and his mother, Elma Robinson, a strict dressmaker, ensured he attended Kingston Senior School where he discovered his musical talents. After graduating, he worked at Peart Electrical in downtown Kingston around 1972 before entering the music scene full-time.[1][2][5]

In 1975, at age 20, General Echo launched his own sound system, Echo Tone HiFi, before joining Ray Symbolic and Stereophonic around 1977, where he gained fame as a deejay. Influenced by U-Roy but pioneering a unique timing, tone, and 'slackness' lyrics—explicit sexual content—he became the 'slackest deejay in dancehall.' His debut recordings included 'People Are You Ready' for Buster Riley in 1977, followed by albums like 'Rocking & Swing' (1979) for Dudley 'Manzie' Swaby, and slack albums such as 'Ranking Slackness' for Winston Riley and '12 Inches of Pleasure' (1980) for Henry 'Junjo' Lawes. Non-slack hits like 'Drunken Master' (Sly & Robbie) and '#1 chart-topper 'Arleen' (Winston Riley) showcased his versatility.[1][2][3]

General Echo's career peaked in 1980, boosting Stereophonic with partners Big John and Flux, and influencing UK markets via Greensleeves. Tragically, on November 22, 1980, at age 24, he was killed by police in Kingston alongside Big John and Flux under controversial circumstances amid political violence, shocking Jamaica and prompting tributes like Clint Eastwood & General Saint's 'Tribute To General Echo.' His bold style shifted dancehall from cultural to risqué lyrics, paving the way for future artists.[1][2][3]

## Fun Facts
- General Echo would halt music during live sets to tell jokes, showcasing his entertainer persona on Echo Tone HiFi.[1]
- His early recordings were 'clean' despite live slackness reputation, with slack albums like '12 Inches of Pleasure' succeeding more overseas via UK’s Greensleeves.[2]
- He self-proclaimed 'slackest deejay in dancehall' and detailed explicit antics, like boasting about private parts' 'gymnastic prowess' even in hell.[3]
- Non-slack single 'Arleen' was his biggest hit, topping Jamaica charts in 1980, the year of his death.[3]
