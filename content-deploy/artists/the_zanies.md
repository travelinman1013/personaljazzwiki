## Biography
The Zanies were a late 1950s American musical group that began as an instrumental combo, notable for their semi-instrumental tracks with a comedic slant. The group included Lew Bedell, who was a key figure in their formation and musical direction. The Zanies were active during a period of significant innovation in American pop and rock music, and their repertoire often blended humor with catchy melodies, setting them apart from more straightforward instrumental acts of the era. Their most notable achievement was a regional hit version of 'The Blob,' the theme song for the 1958 Steve McQueen film, which was originally recorded by The Five Blobs. The Zanies' rendition gained popularity in Los Angeles, showcasing their ability to adapt and reinterpret contemporary hits with their own unique style.

While The Zanies did not achieve widespread national fame, their work contributed to the vibrant Los Angeles music scene of the late 1950s. Their music was characterized by playful arrangements and a lighthearted approach, which resonated with local audiences. The group's legacy is primarily tied to their regional success and their association with the burgeoning West Coast rock and roll movement. Despite limited commercial longevity, The Zanies remain a notable example of the diverse and experimental musical groups that emerged during this transformative period in American music history.
