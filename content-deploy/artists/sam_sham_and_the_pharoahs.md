## Biography
Sam the Sham & the Pharaohs was a pioneering American garage rock band formed in Dallas, Texas, in 1961 by Domingo 'Sam' Samudio, who was born in Dallas in 1937. Samudio, a Navy veteran and voice student at Arlington State College, initially organized the Pharaohs with Carl Miedke, Russell Fowler, Omar 'Big Man' Lopez, and Vincent Lopez, drawing inspiration for the band's name and flamboyant style from the costumes in the film 'The Ten Commandments.' After an unsuccessful early record, Samudio joined Andy and the Nightriders in Louisiana, where he adopted the stage name 'Sam the Sham'—a playful reference to his showmanship and novice organ skills. The group relocated to Memphis, Tennessee, and evolved into Sam the Sham & the Pharaohs with a new lineup: Ray Stinnett (guitar), David Martin (bass), Jerry Patterson (drums), and Butch Gibson (saxophone).

The band broke through in 1965 with 'Wooly Bully,' a self-composed hit that sold three million copies and reached No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100, defying the British Invasion's dominance. Their energetic, campy performances—often featuring Egyptian-themed costumes—were showcased on national TV programs like 'Hullabaloo' and 'The Ed Sullivan Show.' The group followed 'Wooly Bully' with other hits, including 'Li'l Red Riding Hood,' 'Ju Ju Hand,' and 'Red Hot,' cementing their reputation for catchy, novelty-infused rock and roll with Tex-Mex, blues, and R&B influences.

Sam the Sham & the Pharaohs are remembered for their playful approach to music, blending humor and theatricality with solid musicianship. Their legacy includes helping to define 1960s garage rock and influencing subsequent generations of musicians with their distinctive sound and style. Despite being sometimes dismissed as a novelty act, their work has endured, and 'Wooly Bully' remains a staple of rock and roll history.
