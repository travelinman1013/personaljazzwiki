## Biography
Roland Bernard "Bunny" Berigan (1908–1942) was a virtuoso American jazz trumpeter and bandleader, born in Hilbert, Wisconsin, to an Irish-German family. He discovered music early, starting with violin at age six and switching to trumpet by eleven, performing professionally by thirteen. After moving to Madison, Wisconsin, in 1925, Berigan quickly became involved with influential jazz musicians and ensembles, setting the stage for his future in the national jazz scene[2].

Berigan's career took off in the early 1930s as he became a highly sought-after studio musician in New York, recording with major bands and vocalists including the Dorsey Brothers, Paul Whiteman, Bing Crosby, Billie Holiday, and more. His technical mastery and expressive style, blending the lyricism of Bix Beiderbecke with the power of Louis Armstrong, made him a standout soloist[1][3]. In 1937, he formed his own orchestra and recorded his signature song, "I Can't Get Started," which became a jazz standard and was later inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame[2][1]. Despite his immense talent and influence, Berigan's struggles with alcoholism led to a decline in his health and career, and he died at just 33 years old.

Berigan's legacy is profound: he was a direct stylistic link between early jazz greats and the next generation of trumpeters, influencing artists such as Roy Eldridge, Dizzy Gillespie, and Miles Davis. His more than 600 recordings showcase his ability to make any tune uniquely his own, and his contributions helped define the sound of the Swing Era, especially through his work with Benny Goodman and Tommy Dorsey[2][1].
