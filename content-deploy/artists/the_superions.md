## Biography
The Superions is a comedic synth-pop/dance pop trio formed by Fred Schneider, the iconic frontman of The B-52s, during a period when the band was on hiatus and seeking new creative outlets in the mid-1990s. Inspired by a 1960s sci-fi movie about evil beings from outer space, Schneider chose the name The Superions as a fittingly quirky moniker for his side project, emphasizing fun, campy, and novelty-driven music akin to his work with The B-52s.[1][2] Emerging in the late 1990s amid the B-52s' post-fame exhaustion, The Superions allowed Schneider to explore synth-pop with a humorous twist, releasing early tracks like “Totally Nude Island,” described as a demented '60s travelogue.[1][8]

The group's career gained momentum in the 2000s, with releases including the 2009 EP 'Ham' (with a video filmed in Baltimore), a self-titled EP, and the holiday album 'Destination…Christmas!' featuring novelty tracks like “Fruitcake.” [1][3][5][6] Their musical style blends synth-pop, campy dance pop, and B-52s-inspired eccentricity, prioritizing entertainment and provocation over mainstream appeal, much like Schneider's carnival-barking persona in new wave and 1960s rock 'n' roll influences from his Athens, Georgia roots.[1][4] The Superions served as a low-pressure creative outlet alongside Schneider's B-52s commitments, touring sparingly and focusing on EPs and singles into the 2010s, such as 'Konnichiwa.'[4][5]

While not achieving the commercial heights of The B-52s, The Superions' legacy lies in perpetuating Schneider's commitment to fun, avant-garde pop that bridges punk novelty and synth experimentation, maintaining a cult following among fans of quirky, irreverent music.[1][3]
