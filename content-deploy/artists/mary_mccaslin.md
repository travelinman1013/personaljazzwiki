## Biography
Mary McCaslin (December 22, 1946 – October 2, 2022) was a pioneering American folk singer and songwriter whose evocative storytelling and innovative guitar work left a lasting mark on contemporary folk music. Born in Beechgrove, Indiana, and adopted at birth, she was raised in Indianapolis until age six, when her family relocated to Redondo Beach, California. Immersed in the sounds of early rock 'n' roll, bluegrass, and the Western ballads of Marty Robbins, McCaslin began playing guitar as a teenager, making her first public performance at 18 in a Tustin, California coffeehouse. 

McCaslin's career took shape in the vibrant Los Angeles folk scene of the mid-1960s, particularly at the Troubadour club's open-mic nights. She recorded her debut album in 1969 and went on to release a series of acclaimed records, primarily for Philo Records. Her music, which ranged from ballads of the Old West to contemporary reflections, was distinguished by her pioneering use of open guitar tunings and a clear, unaffected vocal style. She often performed and recorded with her husband, fellow folk musician Jim Ringer, and their duo work was highly regarded within folk circles. 

Throughout her career, McCaslin's songwriting and style influenced a new generation of folk and country-pop artists, including Nanci Griffith and Mary Chapin Carpenter. Her songs were covered by notable musicians such as Tom Russell, Bill Staines, Gretchen Peters, David Bromberg, Kate Wolf, and Stan Rogers, attesting to her enduring legacy in American folk music.
