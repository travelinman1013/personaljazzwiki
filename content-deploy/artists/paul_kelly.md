## Biography
Paul Kelly AO was born on January 13, 1955, in Adelaide, Australia, as the sixth of nine children in a Catholic family with operatic heritage.[1][2] He began playing guitar at age 12 and made his performing debut in Hobart in 1974.[1] After arriving in Melbourne in 1976-1977, Kelly immersed himself in the city's pub rock scene, initially performing with Paul Kelly and the Dots, with whom he recorded two albums before the band dissolved in 1982.[1][3] His major breakthrough came in 1986 when his Sydney-based band, initially called The Coloured Girls (named after Lou Reed's 'Walk On The Wild Side') and later renamed Paul Kelly and the Messengers, released the double album *Gossip*, which became one of the biggest Australian records of that year.[1][2]

Throughout his career spanning nearly five decades, Kelly has established himself as one of Australia's most significant singer-songwriters, known for his poetic lyrics, marked Australian accent, and songs deeply rooted in specific Australian people, places, and experiences.[1] He has released 27 studio albums across diverse genres including bluegrass, country, contemporary classical, experimental dub, and soul.[4] Beyond recording, Kelly has worked extensively as a producer and composer for Australian film and television soundtracks, including the cult film *Lantana*.[2] His 2017 album *Life is Fine* marked his first number-one album, followed by two more number-one albums within three years, and his 2019 greatest hits album *Songs from the South* debuted at number one on the ARIA Albums Chart.[1]

Kelly's legacy is defined by his artistic versatility, social consciousness, and collaborative spirit, particularly with First Nations artists.[1] He has received 17 ARIA Awards, including induction into the ARIA Hall of Fame in 1997, and was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia in 2017 for distinguished service to the performing arts and promotion of national identity.[1][2][4] His 2010 memoir *How to Make Gravy*, described as 'the finest and most unflinching autobiography ever written by an Australian musician,' and the 2012 biographical film *Paul Kelly: Stories of Me* have cemented his status as a cultural icon.[1][4]
