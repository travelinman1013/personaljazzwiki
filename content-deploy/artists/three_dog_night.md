## Biography
Three Dog Night is an American rock band formed in Los Angeles, California, in 1967–68 by vocalists Danny Hutton, Cory Wells, and Chuck Negron, who built the group around their shared love of rock and roll, psychedelic pop, doo‑wop, and close‑harmony singing.[1][2][3] After initially working as a vocal trio (briefly under the name Redwood), they decided they should front a full band and recruited Jimmy Greenspoon (keyboards), Joe Schermie (bass), Michael Allsup (guitar), and Floyd Sneed (drums), creating a seven‑piece outfit with three lead singers and four instrumentalists.[1][2][3] Playing clubs around Los Angeles, including the Troubadour and the Whisky a Go Go, they attracted label interest and signed with Dunhill Records, releasing their debut album "Three Dog Night" (also known as *One*), which produced early hits such as "Nobody," "Try a Little Tenderness," and a cover of Harry Nilsson’s "One" that reached the U.S. Top 5 and established them as a major live and recording act.[1][2][3]

From 1969 to the mid‑1970s, Three Dog Night became one of the most commercially successful American rock bands, scoring an extraordinary run of consecutive hit singles by recording and re‑arranging songs by outside writers rather than focusing on original material.[1][3] Between 1969 and 1975 they amassed around 18–21 U.S. Top 40 hits, including three number‑one singles, and were noted for their distinctive three‑part lead‑vocal blend on songs such as "Joy to the World" (Hoyt Axton), "An Old Fashioned Love Song" (Paul Williams), "Liar" (Russ Ballard), and "The Show Must Go On" (Leo Sayer), helping introduce these songwriters to a much wider public.[1][3] Extensive touring, stadium‑level audiences, and a steady stream of radio hits made them a defining pop‑rock presence of the era, but internal tensions, lineup changes, and substance‑abuse problems contributed to a decline and eventual disbandment in the mid‑1970s.[1][3] The group reunited in 1981 with most of the classic lineup (minus bassist Joe Schermie), and although they never regained their peak chart dominance, Three Dog Night has continued as a touring entity—anchored by founding member Danny Hutton—bringing their harmony‑driven soft‑rock sound to new generations and leaving a legacy as key interpreters of late‑1960s and early‑1970s American pop rock.[3][5]

## Fun Facts
- The band’s name came from an article about Australian Aboriginal custom: on the coldest outback nights, people would sleep with their dogs for warmth, and the very coldest conditions were described as a "three dog night."[3][5]
- Before they became Three Dog Night, Hutton, Wells, and Negron briefly worked under the name Redwood and were nearly produced by Brian Wilson for the Beach Boys’ Brothers Records label, a deal that fell through when the rest of the Beach Boys objected to Wilson writing for another act.[3]
- Three Dog Night’s debut album was recorded essentially live in the studio, with the band playing and the singers performing simultaneously, using no double‑tracking and no overdubs, which was unusual for a pop‑rock act chasing radio hits at the time.[3]
- During their peak years they were so successful on the road that they regularly broke attendance records in venues ranging from theaters to football stadiums, underscoring their status as one of the era’s top concert draws.[3]

[Influence rooted in members’ formative years, expressed in recordings 1968–mid‑1970s[2]]

### Key Collaborators

- [[cory_wells|Cory Wells]] - Founding lead vocalist known for powerful rock and R&B‑tinged leads; central to the group’s classic recordings and live performances.

- [[chuck_negron|Chuck Negron]] - Founding lead vocalist whose soulful style fronted several of the band’s biggest hits; later toured separately amid disputes over the group name. (Lead vocals on major hits including several early 1970s singles; member of the original hit‑making lineup and the 1981 reunion before legal and personal conflicts.) [1967–mid‑1970s; reunion and subsequent legal disputes in the 1980s–1990s[1][3]]
- [[jimmy_greenspoon|Jimmy Greenspoon]] - Original keyboardist whose playing and arrangements were central to the band’s sound both in the studio and onstage.

### Artists Influenced
- [[songwriters_such_as_paul_williams_and_hoyt_axton|Songwriters such as Paul Williams and Hoyt Axton]] - Their commercial success with outside writers’ material gave those writers major exposure, royalties, and industry credibility.

[Impact concentrated during Three Dog Night’s hit period, 1969–mid‑1970s[1]]
- [[later_poprock_and_softrock_vocal_groups|Later pop‑rock and soft‑rock vocal groups]] - Their model of three interchangeable lead singers over a rock backing, and their willingness to champion outside songwriters, influenced how later bands approached harmony vocals and repertoire selection. (General influence on multi‑vocalist arrangements and cover‑driven album concepts in 1970s–1980s pop‑rock (inferred from their documented emphasis on outside material and vocal blend).) [Influence emerging from the early 1970s onward[1][2][3]]
