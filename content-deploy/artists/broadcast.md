## Biography
Broadcast were an English experimental pop band formed in Birmingham in 1995 by vocalist and multi‑instrumentalist Trish Keenan and bassist James Cargill, who met at the Sensateria psychedelic club and initially performed under the name Pan Am Flight Bag.[3] Emerging at the tail end of Britpop, they contrasted sharply with the guitar‑driven mainstream by drawing on 1960s psychedelic pop, early electronic music, library and soundtrack records, and esoteric samples, crafting songs that felt both haunted and futuristic.[3][1] The early lineup solidified with Tim Felton on guitar, Roj Stevens on keyboards, and Steve Perkins on drums, and the group quickly attracted attention through singles on Wurlitzer Jukebox and Duophonic, including “Accidentals” and “The Book Lovers,” the latter gaining wider notice via the soundtrack to Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery.[2][3]

Signed to Warp Records, Broadcast released the singles compilation Work and Non Work in 1997 before issuing their debut album The Noise Made by People in 2000, a painstakingly self‑produced record that established their blend of fragile melodies, tape‑worn electronics, and retro‑futurist atmosphere.[3] They followed with Haha Sound in 2003, which expanded their sound palette and became their first U.S. charting release, and Tender Buttons in 2005, a more minimal, abrasive set recorded after the band had effectively condensed to the core duo of Keenan and Cargill.[3] Throughout, their music fused pop songcraft with musique concrète, vintage synths, and analogue production techniques, while Keenan’s clear, distant vocal delivery and interest in folk and surrealist literature (reflected in references like the Gertrude Stein‑inspired title Tender Buttons) gave their work a singular character.[3][5]

In the late 2000s Broadcast deepened their interest in occult and hauntological aesthetics through a close creative partnership with graphic designer and musician Julian House, culminating in the 2009 collaborative album Broadcast and The Focus Group Investigate Witch Cults of the Radio Age.[1][3] The band’s activity effectively ceased in 2011 after Keenan died from complications of pneumonia and H1N1 influenza, leaving Cargill to oversee the group’s legacy and unreleased material.[3][6] A posthumous collection of Keenan’s demo recordings, Distant Call, was released in 2024, underlining how enduring their influence has been on later generations of dream pop, indie electronic, and neo‑psychedelic artists who look to Broadcast as key innovators in marrying experimental sound design with emotionally resonant pop songs.[3][2]

## Fun Facts
- "The Book Lovers," one of Broadcast’s early singles, appeared on the soundtrack to the 1997 film Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery, giving the band unexpected exposure far beyond the UK indie scene.[2][3]
- Before adopting the name Broadcast, Trish Keenan and James Cargill performed under the name Pan Am Flight Bag, a moniker they used for several shows before settling on their more familiar identity.[3]
- Tender Buttons, Broadcast’s stark 2005 album, takes its title from Gertrude Stein’s experimental 1914 book, reflecting Keenan’s interest in modernist literature and nonlinear, fragmentary language.[3]
- Their 2009 collaboration with The Focus Group, Broadcast and The Focus Group Investigate Witch Cults of the Radio Age, was inspired by occult imagery, vintage children’s television, and library music, helping to cement their reputation as key figures in the so‑called hauntological wing of British experimental music.[3][1]

## Musical Connections

### Mentors/Influences
- [[the_united_states_of_america|The United States of America]] - Cult 1960s psychedelic and electronic rock band whose lone 1968 album was a key touchstone for Broadcast’s fusion of avant‑garde electronics and pop songwriting. (The United States of America (1968) – cited in discussions of Broadcast’s psychedelic and electronic lineage.) [Influence acknowledged retrospectively in interviews and critical writing about Broadcast’s 1995–2005 work.[1][3]]
- [[1960s_psychedelic_pop_and_soundtracklibrary_music_various_artists|1960s psychedelic pop and soundtrack/library music (various artists)]] - Broadcast have consistently been described as drawing heavily on 1960s psychedelic songwriting, experimental electronic music, and obscure film and library records, which functioned as their core stylistic influences rather than formal teachers. (General influence audible across The Noise Made by People, Haha Sound, and Tender Buttons, particularly in their use of tape effects, vintage synths, and retro‑futurist arrangements.) [Primary influence throughout Broadcast’s recording career, 1995–2011.[3][1][5]]

### Key Collaborators
- [[james_cargill|James Cargill]] - Co‑founder, bassist, multi‑instrumentalist, producer, and one of the two constant members of Broadcast alongside Trish Keenan. (All core releases, including The Noise Made by People (2000), Haha Sound (2003), Tender Buttons (2005), Broadcast and The Focus Group Investigate Witch Cults of the Radio Age (2009), and the posthumous demos collection Distant Call (2024).) [1995–2011 (active band years) and posthumous archive work thereafter.[3]]

(Work and Non Work (1997 compilation of early singles), The Noise Made by People (2000), Haha Sound (2003).) [Mid‑1990s formation through his departure after the Haha Sound era (circa 2003–2004).[3][1]]
- [[roj_stevens|Roj Stevens]] - Keyboardist whose analogue electronics and textures contributed to the band’s early and classic‑period arrangements. (Early singles era, Work and Non Work (1997), The Noise Made by People (2000), and associated live performances.) [Mid‑ to late‑1990s into the early 2000s.[3][1]]
- [[steve_perkins_and_other_drummers_keith_york_phil_jenkins_jeremy_barnes_neil_bullock_ash_sheehan|Steve Perkins and other drummers (Keith York, Phil Jenkins, Jeremy Barnes, Neil Bullock, Ash Sheehan)]] - Touring and session drummers who provided Broadcast’s live rhythmic foundation and contributed to recordings across different periods. (Live support and sessions surrounding The Noise Made by People, Haha Sound, and related EPs; Jeremy Barnes notably joined for U.S. touring after Haha Sound.) [Late 1990s through mid‑2000s, varying by individual drummer.[3]]
- [[julian_house__the_focus_group|Julian House / The Focus Group]] - Graphic designer, label co‑founder, and musician who became a close creative ally; collaborated with Broadcast on visual identity and a full joint album steeped in occult and hauntological imagery.

[Mid‑2000s collaboration leading up to and including the 2009 album.[3][1]]

### Artists Influenced
- [[contemporary_dream_pop_and_indie_electronic_artists_various_e.g._later_warpadjacent_and_underground_acts|Contemporary dream pop and indie electronic artists (various, e.g., later Warp‑adjacent and underground acts)]] - Critical retrospectives highlight Broadcast as a foundational reference point for later dream pop, neo‑psychedelia, and hauntological electronic music, citing their blend of pop melody with experimental electronics as especially influential. (Influence heard broadly in post‑2000s dream pop and experimental electronic releases; commentators credit albums like Haha Sound and Tender Buttons as touchstones for subsequent artists’ approaches to texture and mood.[5][6][3]) [Influence most strongly noted from the late 2000s onward, particularly after Keenan’s death in 2011 and the band’s growing cult status.[5][6]]
