## Biography
Creole String Beans is a New Orleans-based band formed in 2004, known for their energetic performances and dedication to the city’s rich musical heritage. The group was established to celebrate the classic New Orleans rock 'n roll sound from the glory days of J&M Studios, a period when local R&B artists dominated the charts and shaped the city’s musical identity[6][7]. The band quickly gained a following through regular appearances at local clubs and festivals, earning a reputation for their lively shows and authentic renditions of regional classics.

The band’s lineup features seasoned musicians, including Acadiana natives Rob Savoy (bass, vocals) and Rick Olivier (guitar, vocals), joined by Brian Rini on keyboards, Tom Hoey on drums, and other local talents[8]. Their musical style blends elements of zydeco, Cajun, swamp pop, R&B, and rock 'n roll, reflecting the diverse influences of Louisiana’s cultural landscape. Rather than focusing solely on traditional zydeco or Cajun music, Creole String Beans pays homage to the broader spectrum of New Orleans roots music, often reinterpreting classic songs with their own swinging, danceable flair[6][7].

Over the years, Creole String Beans has become a staple of the New Orleans live music scene, performing at major festivals and venues throughout the region. Their commitment to preserving and revitalizing the sounds of mid-century New Orleans has earned them respect among local musicians and audiences alike, contributing to the ongoing legacy of Louisiana’s vibrant musical traditions.
