## Biography
T-Model Ford, born James Lewis Carter Ford in 1924 in Forest, Mississippi, was a renowned American blues musician. His early life was marked by hard labor and a stint on a chain gang. Ford didn't take up the guitar until he was 58, after his fifth wife left him, giving him the instrument as a parting gift. He began his musical career in his early seventies, recording for Fat Possum Records and later Alive Naturalsound Records. His style blended traditional Delta blues with Chicago and juke joint blues, characterized by raw, passionate performances. Ford's music career spanned several albums, including 'Pee-Wee Get My Gun,' 'You Better Keep Still,' and 'Bad Man.' He was known for his gritty voice and guitar playing, which gave his music a unique, soulful tonality. Ford's life and music were marked by his rough past and his ability to convey deep emotions through his songs. He passed away on July 16, 2013, in Greenville, Mississippi. Ford's legacy as one of the last authentic Mississippi bluesmen is cemented by his raw, unpolished style that captivated audiences worldwide. His performances were often described as raucous and powerful, reflecting his life experiences and emotional depth. Ford's music career was a testament to his resilience and talent, making him a beloved figure in the blues community.
