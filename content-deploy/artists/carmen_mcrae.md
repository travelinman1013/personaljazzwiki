## Biography
Carmen McRae, born April 8, 1920 in Harlem, New York City to Jamaican immigrant parents, emerged as one of the most influential jazz vocalists of the 20th century. Raised in a musically rich environment, she began piano lessons at age eight and was deeply influenced by the jazz legends whose records filled her home. As a teenager, McRae befriended composer Irene Kitchings, who introduced her to Billie Holiday—McRae’s lifelong idol and primary stylistic influence. McRae’s early songwriting talent was recognized when Holiday recorded her composition 'Dream of Life' in 1939[1][2][3].

McRae’s career developed through her work as a pianist and vocalist in New York’s vibrant jazz scene, performing with big bands led by Benny Carter, Count Basie, and Mercer Ellington in the 1940s. She made her first recordings under the name Carmen Clarke, after marrying drummer Kenny Clarke. Her distinctive behind-the-beat phrasing and ironic lyric interpretation set her apart, and she soon signed with Decca Records, releasing a series of acclaimed albums. McRae’s artistry earned her numerous accolades, including six Grammy nominations, the NAACP award, and the National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Masters Fellowship[1][2][3][4].

Throughout her five-decade career, McRae was celebrated for her emotional depth, technical mastery, and ability to reinterpret standards with originality. She performed worldwide, recorded tributes to Billie Holiday, Thelonious Monk, and Sarah Vaughan, and influenced generations of vocalists. Her legacy endures in the pantheon of jazz greats, alongside Ella Fitzgerald and Sarah Vaughan, as a masterful interpreter of song[1][4][5].
