## Biography
Andrea Benini, born on March 14, 1977, in Cesena, Italy, began his musical journey early, picking up the guitar at age 10 and switching to drums at 14. He moved to Bologna at the end of 1999 to study at the DAMS program, focusing on African-American and contemporary music, while working as a journalist for the Italian magazine 'Percussioni' from 2000 to 2003, interviewing drummers like Joey Baron, John Riley, and Terry Clarke.[1][2]

In 2005, Benini launched his primary project Mop Mop, blending funk, afro, jazz, and club elements, with his debut album 'The 11th Pill' released by Tam Tam Studio and later reissued in Japan. Subsequent albums like 'Kiss of Kali' (2009), 'Ritual of the Savage' (2010), 'Isle of Magic' (2013), and 'Lunar Love' (2016) featured collaborations with notable artists and gained international exposure, including a track on Woody Allen's 'To Rome With Love' soundtrack in 2012. His music has been supported by DJs such as Gilles Peterson and released by labels including Sony/BMG, Universal, and Agogo Records.[1][2]

Now based in Berlin, Benini continues as a drummer, composer, producer, and DJ, performing worldwide in clubs, festivals, and on radio/television across Europe, the US, and Russia. His style fuses modern jazz with electronic and downtempo influences, earning recognition like 'Run Around' being named the best dancefloor jazz track of 2013 by Red Bull Music Academy Germany.[2][3]
