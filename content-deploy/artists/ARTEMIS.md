## Biography
ARTEMIS is a critically acclaimed modern jazz supergroup formed by pianist and composer Renee Rosnes. The ensemble brings together a powerhouse lineup of internationally recognized musicians: Renee Rosnes (piano, musical director), Ingrid Jensen (trumpet), Nicole Glover (tenor saxophone), Noriko Ueda (bass), and Allison Miller (drums). The group initially came together for a European festival tour at Rosnes’ invitation, discovering a unique chemistry that led them to formalize as a band. Their self-titled debut album was released on Blue Note Records, a label renowned for championing leading voices in jazz.

ARTEMIS is celebrated for its cosmopolitan, rhythm-forward sound that blends the distinct voices and compositional styles of its members. Each musician is a bandleader and composer in their own right, contributing original works and arrangements to the group’s repertoire. The band’s performances at major venues and festivals across North America and Europe have garnered widespread critical acclaim. NPR described ARTEMIS as “a killer line-up of players, composers and performers…who converge on an extremely cosmopolitan, sleek, rhythm-forward, modern sound.” Their third album, 'Arboresque,' is scheduled for release in February 2025, further cementing their legacy as a leading force in contemporary jazz.

Despite its relatively recent formation, ARTEMIS has already achieved significant recognition, including being named #1 Group of the Year in the Annual Downbeat Readers Poll in both 2023 and 2024. The group’s multinational and multi-generational lineup—featuring artists from the US, Canada, and Japan—reflects a commitment to diversity and innovation in jazz. Their collective approach and virtuosic interplay have established ARTEMIS as a symbol of modern jazz excellence.
