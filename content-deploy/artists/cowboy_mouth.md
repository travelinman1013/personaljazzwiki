- **Origin**: New Orleans

## Biography
Cowboy Mouth formed in 1990 in New Orleans, Louisiana, emerging from the city's vibrant punk rock and new music scene of the late 1980s and early 1990s. The band was founded by drummer and frontman Fred LeBlanc, who had previously performed with the punkabilly band Dash Rip Rock, and guitarist John Thomas Griffith, formerly the lead singer of the Red Rockers, a successful touring band that performed with artists like U2, the Go-Go's, and Men at Work. Completing the original lineup were bassist Rob Savoy, who had fronted the Blues Runners, and guitarist Paul Sanchez, a solo performer from New Orleans' Irish Channel neighborhood. The band's festive, free-wheeling style stood in sharp contrast to the then-popular grunge sound, creating a unique blend of rock, punk, blues, funk, country, and soul that reflected their New Orleans heritage.[1][4][6]

Cowboy Mouth achieved significant commercial success throughout the 1990s and 2000s. In 1996, they signed with MCA Records and released their major label debut, *Are You with Me?*, which included material from Sanchez's solo album *Jet Black and Jealous*. The band followed this with the studio album *Mercyland* in 1998 and numerous live recordings. Their signature song, "Jenny Says," reached the upper half of the Billboard rock charts, becoming their most recognizable hit.[1][2][3] Over three decades of touring and recording, the band has sold more than 500,000 albums domestically, performed before more than 9-10 million fans, and played over 2,500-3,000 concerts, frequently averaging 250 shows per year.[2][3][5] The band's current lineup includes co-founders LeBlanc and Griffith, alongside bassist Brian "Bruiser" Broussard (who joined in 2014) and guitarist Frank "Frankie G" Grocholski, continuing their legacy as one of rock music's most relentless touring acts.[5]
