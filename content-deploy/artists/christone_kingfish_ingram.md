## Biography
Christone "Kingfish" Ingram, born January 19, 1999, in Clarksdale, Mississippi, is widely recognized as one of the most exciting and influential young blues guitarists and vocalists of his generation[4][1]. Raised in the heart of the Mississippi Delta—a region synonymous with blues legends—Ingram was immersed in the genre from an early age, learning the history and techniques at the Delta Blues Museum’s music education program. He began performing locally while still in seventh grade, quickly gaining a devoted following through gigs at iconic venues such as Red's Lounge and Ground Zero Blues Club[4][3]. By age 15, he had already performed at the White House for Michelle Obama as part of the museum’s band[4][3].

Ingram’s career accelerated with the release of his debut album, "Kingfish," in 2019, produced by Grammy-winner Tom Hambridge and released on Alligator Records[4][2]. The album topped the Billboard Blues Chart and established him as a torchbearer for modern blues, blending traditional Delta influences with rock and R&B elements. His follow-up, "662" (2021), won the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Blues Album, further cementing his reputation[4][3]. Ingram has toured globally, headlined major festivals, and opened for acts such as The Rolling Stones, Vampire Weekend, and Buddy Guy, who also mentored him[1][5]. His third album, "Live in London," was released in 2023 to critical acclaim[1].

Kingfish’s musical style draws deeply from Delta blues traditions while incorporating the emotional authority and technical prowess of artists like B.B. King, Jimi Hendrix, and Prince[1][3][7]. His rich baritone and expressive guitar work have made him a defining voice in contemporary blues. Beyond performance, Ingram launched his own label, Red Zero Records, in 2024, aiming to support the next generation of blues artists[4].
