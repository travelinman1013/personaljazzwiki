## Biography
Claire Elizabeth Cottrill, known professionally as **Clairo**, is an American singer‑songwriter born on August 18, 1998, in Atlanta, Georgia, and raised in Carlisle, Massachusetts.[1][2] She began recording and uploading covers and original songs from her laptop around age 13, posting to YouTube, Bandcamp, and SoundCloud under the names Clairo and DJ Baby Benz while attending Concord‑Carlisle High School.[1][7] Early self‑released EPs such as *Do U Wanna Fall in Love?* (2013) and several 2015 projects built a small online following and led to coverage in teen culture outlets like *Rookie* magazine.[1][4] After briefly enrolling in Syracuse University’s Bandier Program for Recording and Entertainment Industries, she left after a year—encouraged by program director Bill Werde—to pursue music full‑time as her audience rapidly expanded.[1]

Clairo’s commercial breakthrough came in 2017 when the lo‑fi, self‑shot video for her song “Pretty Girl,” created for an indie rock cassette compilation benefiting the Transgender Law Center, went viral on YouTube.[1][4] The success of “Pretty Girl” led to a joint record deal with Fader Label and the release of her debut EP *Diary 001* in 2018, featuring collaborations with producer Danny L Harle and rapper Rejjie Snow, and support slots on Dua Lipa’s tour.[1][4][5] Her debut album *Immunity* (2019) pushed her beyond the “bedroom pop” tag, incorporating indie rock, soft pop, and subtle electronic elements on songs like “Bags” and “Sofia,” the latter becoming her first Billboard Hot 100 hit and earning her Apple Music’s *Up Next* spotlight.[1] She followed it with *Sling* (2021), a more subdued, 1970s‑inspired singer‑songwriter record co‑produced with Jack Antonoff, written amid reflections on domesticity and whether to continue in music.[4][6] Across these releases, Clairo’s style has evolved from lo‑fi, DIY pop toward richly arranged, introspective songs informed by classic pop, soul, and folk, while her candid lyrics about identity, illness (including her rheumatoid arthritis diagnosis at 17), and mental health have helped establish her as a key voice in contemporary indie and bedroom pop.[1][4]

Though still early in her career, Clairo has already left a notable legacy in the rise of internet‑born “bedroom pop,” demonstrating how low‑budget, home‑recorded songs can transition into critically acclaimed, sonically expansive albums.[1][4] Her success helped normalize lo‑fi aesthetics, casual visual presentation, and deeply personal songwriting for a new generation of artists emerging from YouTube and streaming platforms, and she has been frequently cited in media discussions of how young musicians navigate privilege, industry structures, and online virality.[1][4] As she continues to develop her sound—drawing on influences from indie rock to 1960s–70s pop and soul—Clairo remains an important reference point for artists who blend DIY origins with polished, emotionally nuanced studio work.[1][4]

## Fun Facts
- Clairo’s breakout song “Pretty Girl” was originally recorded for a small cassette‑only indie rock compilation released in a run of just 250 copies, with proceeds going to the Transgender Law Center, before its homemade YouTube video unexpectedly went viral.[1][4]
- Before her official Clairo releases, she quietly uploaded not only music but also short films to YouTube and maintained multiple channels—one for original work and another for covers and films—while still in high school.[1]
- She was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis at age 17, and her struggles with the condition influenced both the title and themes of her debut album *Immunity*.[1][4]
- During the period when she was unsure whether to continue pursuing music, she wrote much of *Sling* while living at home with her parents and a newly adopted rescue dog named Joanie, likely named after Joni Mitchell.[4][6]
