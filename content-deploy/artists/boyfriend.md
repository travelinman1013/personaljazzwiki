## Biography
Boyfriends is a pioneering musical group from Quezon City, Philippines, best known for their influential role in the Manila Sound movement during the late 1970s and early 1980s[1][3]. Formed in 1970, the band originally featured Bob Guzman, Gary Ariola, Artie Ilacad, and Joey Abando, with Lloyd Sale joining later. Their signature sound blends pop, disco, and harmonious vocals reminiscent of the Bee Gees, which helped define the era’s Filipino popular music[1][2].

Throughout their career, Boyfriends released several albums, including 'Dahil Mahal Kita' (1978), 'With Love' (1978), and 'Forever' (1981), producing enduring hits such as 'Bakit Labis Kitang Mahal,' 'Dahil Mahal Kita,' and 'Sumayaw, Sumunod.' These songs have become staples in the Filipino music canon, covered by prominent artists like Lea Salonga, Ogie Alcasid, and Dingdong Avanzado[1]. Their music, characterized by catchy melodies and heartfelt lyrics, continues to resonate with new generations, cementing their legacy as icons of OPM (Original Pilipino Music)[1][3].

The Boyfriends' influence extends beyond their own recordings, as their work has been anthologized and frequently revived in contemporary media and performances. Their contributions to Philippine music have earned them recognition and awards, including the Awit Award for Dangal ng Musikang Pilipino, and their songs remain a touchstone for both nostalgic audiences and modern musicians[3].
