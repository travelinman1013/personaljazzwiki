## Biography
The Gaturs were a New Orleans-based funk and soul group led by veteran session musician Willie Tee (Wilson Turbinton), whose innovative keyboard work and songwriting helped shape the city's musical landscape in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Emerging from the vibrant New Orleans scene, the Gaturs blended jazz-inflected funk with soulful grooves, creating a sound that was both sophisticated and deeply rooted in the city's rhythmic traditions. While their output was limited to a handful of singles, their music remains influential among collectors and aficionados of deep funk.

Willie Tee's leadership brought a distinctive edge to the Gaturs, drawing on his experience as a solo artist and his collaborations with other New Orleans legends. The band was not as widely recognized as contemporaries like The Meters, but their approach to funk was less minimalist and more harmonically rich, incorporating jazz elements and complex arrangements. The Gaturs' recordings, such as "Concentrate," have been sampled by hip-hop artists and continue to be rediscovered by new generations, underscoring their lasting impact on American music.

Despite their relatively brief career, the Gaturs are celebrated for their role in expanding the boundaries of New Orleans funk and soul. Willie Tee's work with the group, as well as his later projects, helped introduce the city's unique musical vocabulary to a wider audience, influencing genres from funk to hip-hop and leaving a legacy that endures in contemporary music.
