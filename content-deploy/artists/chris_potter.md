## Biography
Chris Potter, born January 1, 1971, in Chicago, Illinois, spent his formative years in Columbia, South Carolina, where he grew up in a musical household with his pianist mother and developed an early interest in various instruments including piano and guitar. Inspired by Paul Desmond, he took up the alto saxophone at age 10, played his first jazz gig at 13, and quickly gained local acclaim, winning the International Association for Jazz Education Young Talent Award for Saxophone at age 12 and performing regularly in Columbia's jazz clubs.[1][2][5][7] After graduating from Dreher High School, he moved to New York City at 18 to study at The New School and Manhattan School of Music, immersing himself in the jazz scene and beginning his professional career.[1][2][3][4]

Potter rose to prominence as a sideman with bebop trumpeter Red Rodney (1989–1993), followed by long-term collaborations with Paul Motian (1994–2009), Dave Holland (1999–2007), and Dave Douglas (1998–2003), while releasing his debut album *Presenting Chris Potter* in 1993 and building a prolific solo career with over 15 leader albums.[1][2][4][6] His musical style blends mainstream jazz traditions from Coleman Hawkins and Charlie Parker through John Coltrane and Michael Brecker, with versatility extending to jazz fusion, free jazz, pop, and R&B, as heard in groove-oriented works like *Underground* (2006) featuring Craig Taborn, Wayne Krantz or Adam Rogers, and Nate Smith.[1][2][4] Albums such as *Vertigo* (1998) and *Lift: Live at Village Vanguard* (2004) earned critical acclaim, reflecting his evolution as a composer and multi-instrumentalist.[1]

Now based in New York City, Potter's legacy includes Grammy nominations, the 2000 Jazzpar Prize (youngest recipient), and recognition as one of the most influential saxophonists of his generation, praised by Dave Liebman and Down Beat readers, with sideman work on over 100 albums including Steely Dan's Grammy-winning *Two Against Nature* (2000).[1][4][6]

## Fun Facts
- At age 15, piano legend Marian McPartland told his father he was ready for the road with Woody Herman’s band, though he prioritized finishing school.[4]
- His 1998 album *Vertigo* was inspired by Ménière's disease, which caused severe dizziness and hearing damage in one ear.[1]
- He won the International Association for Jazz Education Young Talent Award for Saxophone at age 12, just two years after starting the instrument.[5][7]
- Down Beat readers voted him second only to Sonny Rollins in the 2008 Readers Poll for tenor saxophonists.[4][6]
