## Biography
Cameron Graves is a visionary pianist, keyboardist, and composer who emerged as a founding member of the Los Angeles-based West Coast Get Down collective, a genre-blurring group that marked a seismic shift in the contemporary jazz landscape.[1][2] Born and raised in Los Angeles, Graves began his musical journey at age four, studying classical piano under his father's guidance, which provided the disciplinary foundation for his later work.[6] He met saxophonist Kamasi Washington, trombonist Ryan Porter, and the Bruner brothers during his freshman year at Locke High School in Los Angeles, where they bonded over their shared obsession with John Coltrane and began performing together as the Young Jazz Giants at age 16.[1] This formative period of collaboration, which evolved through performances at local venues like Doboy's Dozens and the legendary Piano Bar in Hollywood, cultivated the collective chemistry and experimental approach that would define the West Coast Get Down's sound.

Graves' distinctive artistic voice synthesizes classical training, jazz sophistication, hip-hop sensibilities, and heavy metal influences into what critics have termed "thrash-jazz."[2] His debut solo album, Planetary Prince (2017), released on Mack Avenue Records, expanded from an initial four-song EP into an eight-track full-length work that showcased his mind-expanding compositional vision.[1][2] The album's title and conceptual framework derive from The Urantia Book, a spiritual tome that explores cosmological and spiritual themes including interplanetary travel and the battle between good and evil, reflecting Graves' interest in blending musical innovation with metaphysical inquiry.[4] Following the critical success of Planetary Prince, Graves released Seven (2018) and Live From Seven Spheres, continuing to expand his sonic palette while maintaining the intense energy and sophisticated ensemble dynamics that earned him recognition as a musical genius from collaborators like Kamasi Washington.[3] Beyond his solo work, Graves has carved out a parallel career with his brother Taylor in the R&B/fusion duo The Graves Brothers, and has toured extensively with Stanley Clarke's band, establishing himself as a central figure in contemporary progressive jazz.

## Fun Facts
- Graves made his recorded debut at only 16 years old with the Young Jazz Giants collective, alongside Kamasi Washington and the Bruner brothers.[1]
- Before becoming a jazz innovator, Graves and his brother Taylor found enormous success in England as part of a British/American pop group called The Score, which later evolved into the R&B/fusion duo The Graves Brothers.[1]
- Graves grew up headbanging to Living Colour and other heavy metal bands in Los Angeles, an influence that directly shaped his distinctive 'thrash-jazz' sound that blends metal aggression with jazz sophistication.[7]
- The conceptual framework for Graves' albums draws from The Urantia Book, a 20th-century spiritual tome that explores cosmological mysteries and interplanetary themes, reflecting his interest in merging musical innovation with metaphysical inquiry.[4]
