## Biography
Kennedy William Gordy, professionally known as Rockwell, was born on March 15, 1964, in Detroit, Michigan. The son of Motown founder Berry Gordy and Margaret Norton, Rockwell grew up surrounded by music and the legacy of Motown, but he was determined to carve out his own path. He secured his record deal with Motown independently, wishing to avoid the perception of nepotism, and adopted the stage name 'Rockwell' at the label's suggestion, believing he 'rocked well' on stage.[1][2][5]

Rockwell's career peaked in the early 1980s with the release of his debut single "Somebody's Watching Me" in 1984. The track, featuring childhood friend Michael Jackson on the chorus and Jermaine Jackson on backing vocals, became a massive hit, reaching #2 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and #1 on the R&B chart for five weeks. The song's blend of synth-pop and R&B, combined with its paranoid theme and distinctive falsetto vocals, made it a staple of 1980s pop culture. Despite his initial success, Rockwell's subsequent singles, such as "Obscene Phone Caller," did not achieve the same level of popularity, and he eventually ended his tenure with Motown after releasing two more albums.[1][2][3][5]

Rockwell's legacy is largely tied to "Somebody's Watching Me," which remains a frequently sampled and referenced track in popular music. Beyond his brief but impactful music career, Rockwell has contributed to various charitable organizations, including the Special Olympics and the American Cancer Society, and maintains connections to the broader Gordy family, which includes artists like Redfoo and SkyBlu of LMFAO.[1][2]
