## Biography
Mel Waiters (June 25, 1956 – May 28, 2015) was an American **southern soul** singer best known for his rich baritone voice and party-ready, blues-inflected R&B songs. Born and raised in **San Antonio, Texas**, he began singing in his church choir and working local teen clubs and nightclubs in the early 1970s, developing as both a vocalist and entertainer.[1][2][3][6] He also worked as a radio DJ and performed on military bases, honing his stagecraft and building a regional following around Texas and the Gulf Coast.[1][2][3] These experiences shaped his crowd-pleasing style and his knack for storytelling about everyday adult life, work, love, and nightlife.

Waiters released early material on independent labels, but his breakthrough came in the mid-1990s with the single **“Hit It and Quit It,”** which gained national attention and led to his signing with Malaco Records, the Jackson, Mississippi label renowned for southern soul and blues.[1][4][5] His album *Got My Whiskey* and the title track became signature songs, followed by albums such as *Material Things* (1999), which reached the *Billboard* Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart.[1] Throughout the late 1990s and 2000s he became a fixture on the Southern soul and blues festival circuit, often headlining shows across the South and maintaining a loyal fan base with songs centered on partying, romance, and mature relationship themes.[1][4][6] Waiters described himself primarily as a **soul/R&B artist** rather than a straight blues singer, emphasizing melody and contemporary grooves over traditional 12-bar forms.[7]

His musical style fused classic **soul-blues** vocals with modern R&B production, drawing clear inspiration from powerhouse singers like **Teddy Pendergrass**, whom he cited as his main influence.[1][7] Waiters was known for mid-tempo, bass-driven tracks with conversational lyrics, often addressing working-class listeners and real-life domestic situations. He remained an important figure in the contemporary Southern soul scene into the 2010s, releasing albums, touring heavily, and appearing in publications such as a 2007 cover story in *Living Blues* magazine.[1] Mel Waiters died of cancer on May 28, 2015, in San Antonio, leaving behind a catalog that helped define modern Southern soul and continues to be celebrated on blues and soul radio formats.[1][5][6]
