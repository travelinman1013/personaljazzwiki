## Biography
Mestra Rosália is a revered figure in Brazilian folk music, born and raised in the rural community of Vila Fernandes, Arapiraca, Alagoas. Approaching her 80th birthday, she released her debut album, marking a significant milestone after decades of preserving and performing traditional music. Her early life was shaped by hard agricultural work and deep immersion in the musical traditions of her region, learning countless songs during communal activities such as tobacco harvests, house-building mutirões, and local serenades. She also absorbed influences from traveling groups like Guerreiros, Reisados, and Baianás, which enriched her musical repertoire.

Rosália's artistry is distinguished by her powerful voice and her role as a guardian of intangible cultural heritage. Her music, accompanied by Cia Cabelo de Maria, showcases a wide array of traditions: work songs, coco de roda from Alagoas, aboio (cattle calling), terreiro chants, ciranda, and original samba compositions. The album 'A Luz que me Alumeia' reflects the breadth of her experience and her commitment to sharing the musical legacy of her homeland. Her recognition as a popular singer and master was catalyzed in the late 1990s when music researcher Renata Mattar discovered her during fieldwork, leading to national performances and the eventual production of her album with Gustavo Finkler and the ensemble Cia Cabelo de Maria.

Mestra Rosália's legacy lies in her dedication to preserving and revitalizing rural musical traditions, ensuring that the voices and stories of her community are celebrated and remembered. Her work is now regarded as an important part of Brazil's intangible cultural heritage, inspiring new generations to value and continue these traditions.
