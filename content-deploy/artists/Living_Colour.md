## Biography
Living Colour is an American rock band formed in New York City in 1984 by guitarist Vernon Reid, who was born in London, England, and moved to New York at a young age[1][2][3]. The band’s original lineup included Reid, vocalist Corey Glover, drummer Will Calhoun, and bassist Muzz Skillings, with Doug Wimbish replacing Skillings in 1992[1][3]. Living Colour burst onto the scene in the late 1980s with a sound that fused hard rock, funk, jazz, hip hop, and metal, defying genre conventions and racial expectations in the rock world[1][3][4]. Their debut album, Vivid (1988), propelled them to mainstream success, thanks in part to the hit single 'Cult of Personality,' which won a Grammy Award in 1990[3][4]. The band’s lyrics tackled social issues such as racism, gentrification, and addiction, while their music appealed to a diverse audience and opened doors for future generations of Black rock artists[1][4]. After disbanding in 1995, Living Colour reunited in 2000 and have since released additional albums, continuing to tour and record new music[3]. Their legacy is marked by their pioneering role in breaking racial barriers in rock and their enduring influence on the genre[1][4].
