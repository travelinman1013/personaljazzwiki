## Biography
Joe Williams was born on December 12, 1918, in Cordele, Georgia, but was raised in Chicago, Illinois, where he was immersed in the city’s rich blues and jazz culture. He began singing in gospel groups as a teenager, notably with the Jubilee Boys, and made his professional debut in 1937 with clarinetist Jimmie Noone. Throughout the 1940s, Williams performed with several prominent big bands, including those led by Coleman Hawkins, Lionel Hampton, and Andy Kirk, establishing himself as a versatile and powerful vocalist. His career reached new heights in 1954 when he joined the Count Basie Orchestra, becoming the band’s featured male vocalist and helping to revitalize its popularity. Williams’s smooth baritone voice and mastery of blues and ballads made him a standout, with hits like 'Every Day I Have the Blues' and 'Alright, Okay, You Win' becoming signature songs. After leaving Basie in 1961, Williams launched a successful solo career, fronting small combos and collaborating with jazz greats such as Harry Edison, George Shearing, and Cannonball Adderley. He remained a major figure in jazz, touring and recording well into the 1990s, and was recognized with a Grammy Award and multiple nominations. Williams passed away on March 29, 1999, in Las Vegas, Nevada, leaving behind a legacy as one of the greatest jazz vocalists of the 20th century.
