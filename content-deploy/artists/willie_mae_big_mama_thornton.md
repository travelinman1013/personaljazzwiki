## Biography
Willie Mae “Big Mama” Thornton (December 11, 1926 – July 25, 1984) was an American blues and R&B singer, songwriter, and multi‑instrumentalist whose raw, commanding style helped shape postwar rhythm and blues and early rock and roll.[1][4] Born in Ariton, Alabama (often broadly cited as near Montgomery), she was the daughter of a Baptist minister and grew up singing in church choirs before leaving school to work, then turning to music full time after her mother’s death when she was 14.[1][2][4] In 1941 she joined Sammy Green’s Hot Harlem Revue, touring the segregated South for seven years as a singer, comedian, and dancer and earning the billing “the new Bessie Smith,” while absorbing the styles of Bessie Smith, Ma Rainey, Memphis Minnie, and Junior Parker.[1][2][7] By 1948 she had settled in Houston, Texas, where working with bandleader Johnny Otis and Peacock/Duke Records owner Don Robey placed her at the center of the emerging Texas blues scene.[1][2]

Thornton’s breakthrough came with her 1952 Los Angeles recording of “Hound Dog,” written for her by Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller and released on Peacock in 1953; it topped the R&B charts for seven weeks and sold around two million copies, though she was paid a flat fee of about $500.[1][2][4] Her huge voice, tough persona, and ability to play drums, harmonica, and other instruments made her a formidable live act, but as rock and roll eclipsed R&B in the mid‑1950s and her contracts with Robey and Otis lapsed, her career stalled and she relocated to San Francisco, performing with friends such as Clarence “Gatemouth” Brown.[1][2] The blues revival of the 1960s brought renewed attention: she toured Europe with the American Folk Blues Festival, appeared repeatedly at the Monterey Jazz Festival, and her self‑penned “Ball and Chain” gained iconic status after Janis Joplin’s powerful performances and recordings of the song.[1][3][4] In the late 1960s and 1970s she recorded for labels including Mercury (issuing her most commercially successful album, *Stronger Than Dirt*) and continued to work the festival circuit in the U.S. and Europe, even as heavy drinking undermined her health.[3][4]

Thornton’s musical style fused classic blues phrasing with gospel intensity and a fiercely independent stage presence, often blurring gender norms through her physicality, clothing, and openly lesbian identity.[1][2] Nicknamed “Big Mama” for both her size and the enormous power of her unamplified voice, she delivered earthy, humor‑laced lyrics with a growl and shout that influenced generations of rock and blues singers.[1][5] She remained active into the early 1980s, surviving a serious car accident and appearing at the 1983 Newport Jazz Festival alongside Muddy Waters, B.B. King, and Eddie “Cleanhead” Vinson, captured on the live recording *The Blues—A Real Summit Meeting*.[1][2] Thornton died of a heart attack in Los Angeles on July 25, 1984, at age 57, and was buried in Inglewood Park Cemetery; that same year she was inducted into the Blues Foundation Hall of Fame, followed by induction into the Alabama Music Hall of Fame in 2020.[1][2] Her original recordings of “Hound Dog” and “Ball and Chain,” and her uncompromising persona, have secured her legacy as a foundational figure linking classic blues to rock, soul, and modern blues performance.[1][3][4]

## Fun Facts
- Thornton was a multi‑instrumentalist who could accompany herself on drums and harmonica as well as sing, an unusual combination for a female blues headliner of her era.[1][3][6]
- Although her original “Hound Dog” sold around two million copies and topped the R&B charts for seven weeks, she reportedly received only a $500 one‑time payment for the session.[1][2]
- She was openly lesbian, which, along with her physically imposing presence and androgynous stage style, challenged gender norms in the 1950s R&B world and sometimes strained her relationship with label owner Don Robey.[1]
- Thornton survived a serious car accident in the early 1980s and, despite poor health and years of heavy drinking, still managed a powerful performance at the 1983 Newport Jazz Festival alongside major blues stars.[1][2]

### Mentors/Influences
- [[bessie_smith|Bessie Smith]] - Major vocal and stylistic influence; Thornton was initially promoted as the “New Bessie Smith” and modeled aspects of her blues phrasing and emotional delivery on Smith’s recordings.

- [[ma_rainey|Ma Rainey]] - Pioneer classic blues singer whose recordings shaped Thornton’s sense of phrasing, timing, and bold stage presence. (Indirect influence via Ma Rainey’s classic blues sides, which Thornton cited among artists she listened to early on.) [Cited as an influence from Thornton’s teenage and early touring years in the 1940s.[1][2]]
- [[memphis_minnie|Memphis Minnie]] - Influential guitarist–singer whose tough, guitar‑driven blues and assertive persona informed Thornton’s own image and sound. (General stylistic inspiration through Memphis Minnie’s guitar blues recordings.) [Recognized by Thornton as an early influence during the 1940s Hot Harlem Revue period.[1][2]]
- [[junior_parker|Junior Parker]] - Blues singer and harmonica player whose smooth, yet powerful blues style influenced Thornton’s musical development.

- [[jerry_leiber_and_mike_stoller|Jerry Leiber & Mike Stoller]] - Songwriting team who wrote “Hound Dog” specifically for Thornton during a Los Angeles session. (The original 1952/1953 recording of “Hound Dog” on Peacock Records, which became her signature hit.[1][2]) [1952–1953.]
- [[clarence_gatemouth_brown|Clarence “Gatemouth” Brown]] - Texas blues guitarist and former Duke‑Peacock artist who worked live with Thornton after she moved to San Francisco. (Live performances in San Francisco clubs; cited as an “old friend” she performed with regularly after relocating.) [Late 1950s and early 1960s.[1][2]]
- [[muddy_waters_b.b._king_eddie_cleanhead_vinson|Muddy Waters, B.B. King, Eddie “Cleanhead” Vinson]] - Co‑headliners with Thornton at major festivals, most notably a high‑profile Newport Jazz Festival performance captured on record.

### Artists Influenced
- [[elvis_presley|Elvis Presley]] - Recorded a rock and roll version of “Hound Dog” after Thornton’s hit; his cover became a defining rock classic rooted in her original performance.

- [[janis_joplin|Janis Joplin]] - Deeply influenced by Thornton’s vocal power and repertoire; Joplin’s performances of “Ball and Chain” helped bring wider recognition to Thornton’s songwriting.

- [[later_blues_and_soul_vocalists_various|Later blues and soul vocalists (various)]] - Thornton’s mixture of gospel power, blues grit, and gender‑defying stage persona became a template for later female blues and soul performers, though often without direct attribution.

[1960s onward; cumulative influence documented in retrospective critical writing.[1][5][6]]
