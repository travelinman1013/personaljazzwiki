## Biography
Willie Mae 'Big Mama' Thornton was born on December 11, 1926, in Ariton, Alabama, to a minister's family. Introduced to music through church gospel at an early age, she was inspired by classic blues singers such as Bessie Smith and Memphis Minnie. At just 14 years old, Thornton began performing on the Chitlin Circuit as a member of Sammy Green's Hot Harlem Revue, where she remained for seven years, contributing vocals, drums, and harmonica to the show. In 1948, she settled in Houston, Texas, where she came under the influence of blues greats including Lightnin' Hopkins, Lowell Fulson, Junior Parker, and Clarence 'Gatemouth' Brown, helping to develop the distinctive 'Texas blues' style.

Thornton's rise to prominence came in 1952 when she recorded 'Hound Dog,' written by the young songwriting team of Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller. The song became her biggest hit, staying seven weeks at number one on the Billboard R&B chart in 1953 and selling over 500,000 copies. Her powerful, booming voice and commanding stage presence made her a major force in R&B theaters across the country throughout the 1950s. However, despite her success, Thornton struggled with inconsistent record contracts and limited mainstream recognition. The blues revival of the mid-1960s, driven by artists like Bob Dylan, Eric Clapton, and the Rolling Stones, revitalized her career. She toured Europe with the American Folk Blues Festival in 1965 and performed at prestigious venues including the Monterey Jazz Festival and Newport Jazz Festival, earning recognition as one of the greatest female blues singers of her era.

Thornton's legacy extends far beyond her own recordings. Her composition 'Ball and Chain' became a rock and roll standard when Janis Joplin performed it at the 1967 Monterey Jazz Festival, introducing Thornton's work to mainstream audiences. Throughout her career, Thornton wrote over 20 blues songs and was nominated for Blues Music Awards six times. She was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1984, the year of her death on July 25 in Los Angeles. Her influence on blues, R&B, and rock and roll remains profound, though she was often overlooked and undercompensated during her lifetime. Music producer Chris Strachwitz called her 'the greatest female blues singer of this and any other decade,' recognizing her instrumental role in shaping early rock and roll, particularly through her innovative use of the guitar as a key instrument.

## Fun Facts
- Thornton was called 'Big Mama' for both her size and her robust, powerful voice, and was described as sometimes weighing around 200 pounds with an exuberant stage manner that had audiences 'stomping their feet and shouting encouragement.'
- She was a multi-instrumentalist who was self-taught on drums and harmonica, a rare skill for a female singer in the 1940s-1950s, which impressed producer Don Robey when he discovered her at Houston's El Dorado Ballroom.
- Despite recording 'Hound Dog' first in 1952 and achieving significant commercial success with it, Elvis Presley's 1956 cover version became more famous and culturally iconic, exemplifying how Thornton was often overlooked by white audiences during her lifetime.
- Thornton survived a serious auto accident and continued performing, including a notable 1983 Newport Jazz Festival performance with blues legends Muddy Waters, B.B. King, and Eddie 'Cleanhead' Vinson, which resulted in the live album 'The Blues—A Real Summit Meeting.'
