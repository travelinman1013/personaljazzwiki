## Biography
Michael David Fuller, known professionally as Blaze Foley, was born on December 18, 1949, in West Texas and became one of the most influential yet underappreciated figures in the Texas outlaw music movement.[6] After a musical upbringing performing with his mother and siblings, Fuller adopted the stage name Blaze Foley—inspired by musician Red Foley—and drifted to Austin in the 1970s, where he became a charter member of the South Austin outlaw songwriter circle.[1][2] Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Foley performed across multiple scenes including New Orleans, Houston, and Austin, establishing himself as a poet and accomplished fingerpicker who represented a punk version of the Texas outlaw music movement.[3][5] His eccentric lifestyle—marked by duct-taped cowboy boots, living in his car, sleeping in dumpsters, and a treehouse, often homeless and perpetually broke—gave him profound empathy for society's marginalized and informed the gritty, soulful authenticity of his songwriting.[1][2][5]

Foley's musical output included iconic compositions such as "If I Could Only Fly," the haunting "Clay Pigeons" and "My Reasons Why," and politically charged songs like "Oval Room" and "Election Day."[3] His closest artistic relationship was with legendary songwriter Townes Van Zandt, his guiding light and brother-in-arms, with whom he shared late-night bar sessions, backroom jam sessions, and even spent nights in dumpsters together.[2][4] Despite his talent and the respect of fellow musicians, Foley remained relatively unknown outside his immediate circle during his lifetime, deliberately rejecting the commercial path of Nashville songwriting in favor of artistic integrity.[6] His life was marked by paradox—a songwriter of incredible sensitivity who lived a life of brute force and drunken brawls, craving connection while relentlessly pushing away those who loved him.[4]

Blaze Foley's life ended tragically on February 1, 1989, when he was fatally shot in the chest at age 39 while defending an elderly friend, Concho January, from his son Carey, who was stealing his father's pension checks.[5][6] Though he died relatively unknown, Foley quickly became a legend, with his music and story kept alive by influential artists including Merle Haggard, Willie Nelson, John Prine, Lucinda Williams, Nanci Griffith, and Lyle Lovett.[3][6] His legacy represents the authentic, uncompromising spirit of outlaw country—a musician who valued the craft and soul of songwriting above commercial success or social conformity.

## Fun Facts
- Foley was so frequently arrested on drunk and disorderly and vagrancy charges that when he called to report a fire and identified himself as Blaze Foley, the dispatcher hung up on him, believing it was a prank.[2]
- After being banned from the Kerrville Folk Festival (either for smoking pot with Townes Van Zandt or dumping portable toilets), Foley attempted to sneak back in wearing a woman's dress, only to be thrown out again. When festival director Rod Kennedy later walked into Emmajoe's while Foley was performing, Foley spat on him, and Kennedy jumped onstage and beat him.[2]
- Foley and Townes Van Zandt spent a night together in a dumpster just to experience what it was like, though it was reportedly harder for Van Zandt, who came from a good family and had to work to get down, whereas it came naturally to Foley.[2]
- Foley was known for keeping duct tape on his cowboy boots and wearing duct tape and tinfoil on his clothes along with weird jewelry, making him instantly recognizable in Austin's music scene.[1][2]
