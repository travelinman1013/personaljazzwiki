## Biography
Annisteen Allen, born Ernestine Letitia Allen on November 11, 1920 in Champaign, Illinois, and raised in Toledo, Ohio, was a pioneering American blues and jazz singer[3][5][7][8]. From an early age, Allen sang in church choirs and local amateur groups, eventually joining her high school orchestra as its only Black member, which highlighted her distinctive vocal style[1]. Her professional career began in earnest after a period of hardship, including being stranded in Dallas and briefly leaving music before returning to perform in local clubs[1].

Allen's big break came when she was discovered by bandleader Lucky Millinder, who credited her with learning the art of performance during their seven-year collaboration[1]. She became known for her powerful, throaty vocals and provocative blues delivery, recording with Millinder's orchestra and later with Bull Moose Jackson's band[1][6]. Her repertoire included jazz-tinged blues, boogie-woogie, and early rhythm & blues, with notable tracks such as "Baby, I'm Doin' It" and "Fujiyama Mama"[4]. Allen's style drew comparisons to Ella Fitzgerald and was marked by her mastery of both blues and jazz idioms[2][6].

Despite facing critical resistance to her risqué lyrics and energetic performances, Allen carved out a space for female empowerment in postwar blues, influencing the genre's transition into rockabilly and rhythm & blues[4]. She continued performing and recording into the 1950s, leaving a legacy as one of the overlooked but foundational voices in American blues and jazz history[4][5].
