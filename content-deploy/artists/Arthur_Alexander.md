## Biography
Arthur Alexander (May 10, 1940 – June 9, 1993) was an American country-soul singer and songwriter hailed by AllMusic critic Jason Ankeny as a "country-soul pioneer" whose largely unknown body of work is considered "genius."  Born in Sheffield, Alabama, Alexander's musical journey began with his first single, "Sally Sue Brown," recorded under the name June Alexander (short for Junior) in 1960 at Spar Music in Florence, Alabama, and released on Jud Phillips' Judd Records.  Phillips, brother of music pioneer Sam Phillips, helped launch Alexander's career.  His early work laid the groundwork for his signature sound, blending country and soul influences.

Alexander's breakthrough came in 1961 with "You Better Move On," recorded at the nascent FAME Studios in Florence, Alabama, and released on Dot Records. This song became a soul/R&B chart hit and established FAME Studios, which would later move to Muscle Shoals, Alabama.  Subsequent hits included "Anna (Go to Him)," a U.S. R&B Top Ten hit, and "Every Day I Have to Cry," which was covered by Steve Alaimo and Dusty Springfield.  Despite switching labels to Sound Stage 7 in the mid-1960s and experiencing a period of commercial inactivity, Alexander continued to record, achieving a pop hit with "Every Day I Have to Cry Some" on Buddah Records in 1975.  He also recorded "Burning Love" in 1975, later covered by Elvis Presley.  Throughout his career, Alexander collaborated with various labels and studios, showcasing his versatility and talent.

Alexander's musical style uniquely blended country and soul influences, creating a poignant and intimate sound.  His songs were covered by a remarkable array of artists, including the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, Gerry and the Pacemakers, Otis Redding, Tina Turner, Pearl Jam, Rick Nelson, and Jerry Lee Lewis, a testament to his enduring influence.  Despite periods away from the music business, during which he worked as a bus driver, Alexander's legacy was solidified by his induction into the Alabama Music Hall of Fame in 1990 and a renewed interest in his back catalog leading to his final album, *Lonely Just Like Me*, released in 1993.  Tragically, he died of a heart attack in Nashville three days after a performance with his new band.  He remains the only songwriter whose songs have been covered by the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, and Bob Dylan. Paul McCartney notably stated in 1987 that if the Beatles wanted a sound, it was R&B, and that they wanted to sound like Arthur Alexander.
