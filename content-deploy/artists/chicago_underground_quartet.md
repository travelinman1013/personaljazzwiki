## Biography
The Chicago Underground Quartet is a pioneering free jazz ensemble that emerged from Chicago’s vibrant experimental music scene in the late 1990s. The group was originally formed in 1998 by trumpeter Rob Mazurek, drummer Chad Taylor, guitarist Jeff Parker, and bassist Noel Kupersmith, all of whom were already active in Chicago’s avant-garde circles. Their debut album, released in 2001, showcased an adventurous blend of free improvisation, electronic textures, and influences from African, blues, and modern jazz traditions, reflecting the city’s rich musical heritage and the members’ diverse backgrounds.[6][7][4]

The Quartet is part of the broader Chicago Underground collective, which Mazurek and Taylor established as a platform for boundary-pushing jazz projects, ranging from duo to orchestra formats. Over the years, the group has been recognized for its genre-defying approach, seamlessly integrating elements of electronica, groove, and drone into their music. After a period of relative quiet, the Quartet reformed in 2020 with Josh Johnson replacing Kupersmith on keys, releasing the critically acclaimed album 'Good Days.' Their work continues to be celebrated for its innovation, collective spirit, and deep ties to Chicago’s experimental jazz legacy.[4][1]

The Chicago Underground Quartet’s legacy lies in its role as a catalyst for creative collaboration and its influence on the evolution of modern jazz. The group’s members have each gone on to significant solo and collaborative careers, but the Quartet remains a touchstone for adventurous improvisation and the ongoing vitality of Chicago’s jazz scene.[4]
