## Biography
Nightmares On Wax is the long-running project of George Evelyn, a pioneering figure in British electronic music whose career spans over three decades. Born in Leeds, England, Evelyn emerged from the UK’s vibrant club scene in the late 1980s, blending hip-hop, soul, dub, and jazz into a signature sound that helped define genres like trip hop and downtempo. His early work, including the influential albums 'Smokers Delight' and 'Carboot Soul,' established him as a key artist on Warp Records, known for lush, sample-rich productions and a deep sense of groove.

Sadie Walker, a London-based vocalist, began collaborating with Nightmares On Wax in 2018, first appearing on the track 'Deep Shadows.' Walker’s voice, described as balancing fragility and force, draws inspiration from icons such as Erykah Badu, Nina Simone, and Lauryn Hill. Her partnership with Nightmares On Wax has seen her join him on world tours and contribute to his evolving sound, most recently on the 2025 single 'True' from the album 'Echo45 Sound System.' This collaboration highlights the project’s ongoing commitment to soulful innovation and cross-genre exploration, cementing both artists’ reputations at the intersection of soul and electronic music.
