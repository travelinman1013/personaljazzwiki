## Biography
Johnny Burnette, born John Joseph Burnette on March 25, 1934, in Memphis, Tennessee, grew up in the Lauderdale Courts housing project alongside his older brother Dorsey, immersing themselves in country music from Grand Ole Opry broadcasts and developing a passion for music and boxing. As children, they received guitars from their father but famously smashed them over each other's heads, foreshadowing their rough-and-tumble personas. In 1952, alongside guitarist Paul Burlison—met through boxing—they formed the Rhythm Rangers, evolving into Johnny Burnette & The Rock 'n' Roll Trio by 1956 after moving to New York, winning on Ted Mack's Amateur Hour, and signing with Coral Records. Their raw rockabilly sound, blending aggressive slap bass, lightning guitar riffs, and Johnny's wild vocals on tracks like 'Train Kept A-Rollin'' and 'Tear It Up,' pioneered the genre by fusing country, R&B, and gospel, though commercial success eluded them amid internal conflicts.[1][2][3][5]

Band tensions peaked in 1956 when Dorsey quit before a film appearance, leading the brothers to relocate to Los Angeles in 1957. There, their bold songwriting hustle—staking out Ricky Nelson's home—paid off, with Nelson recording hits like 'Believe What You Say' and 'It's Late.' Signing as a duo with Imperial Records, they penned successes for artists like Roy Brown, while Johnny transitioned to solo pop with Liberty Records, scoring 1960 hits 'Dreamin'' and 'You're Sixteen,' smooth teen idols contrasting his rockabilly roots. He briefly formed his own labels Sahara and Magic Lamp in 1964 before tragedy struck.[1][3][4]

Burnette's legacy endures as a rockabilly pioneer, with 'You're Sixteen' revived in American Graffiti (1973) and by Ringo Starr, and 'Train Kept A-Rollin'' covered by The Yardbirds, Aerosmith, and others. His career bridged raw early rockabilly and polished pop, influencing the genre's evolution despite his untimely death on August 14, 1964, at age 30 in a boating accident on Clear Lake, California.[1][3]

## Fun Facts

- As kids, the brothers received guitars from their father on Christmas and immediately smashed them over each other's heads.
- The trio won Ted Mack's Original Amateur Hour three times in 1956, securing a Coral Records deal but endured endless one-night stands that fueled band breakups.
- Johnny's son Rocky Burnette, born in June 1953, later became a musician with the 1980 hit 'Tired of Toein' the Line'.
