## Biography
Country Joe and the Fish was an American psychedelic rock band formed in Berkeley, California, in 1965. The group was founded by vocalist and guitarist Country Joe McDonald and guitarist Barry 'The Fish' Melton, both of whom had backgrounds in folk music and were influenced by artists like Woody Guthrie. Initially performing as a folk duo, they soon expanded into a full rock band, embracing the burgeoning psychedelic scene in San Francisco. Their debut album, 'Electric Music for the Mind and Body' (1967), became a landmark of the psychedelic era, blending folk, blues, country, and rock with experimental sounds and politically charged lyrics. The band's music was notable for its satirical humor, social commentary, and association with the counterculture movement, particularly in opposition to the Vietnam War. They gained further fame for their performance at Woodstock in 1969, where Country Joe McDonald delivered the iconic 'Fish Cheer.' The band released several influential albums before disbanding in the early 1970s, though they reunited for occasional performances in later years. Their legacy endures as pioneers of psychedelic rock and as voices of the 1960s counterculture.
