## Biography
Willie Humphrey (William James Humphrey Jr.) was a New Orleans clarinetist whose career in brass bands and traditional jazz spanned more than seventy years. Born on December 29, 1900, in New Orleans, Louisiana, he grew up in one of the city’s most renowned musical dynasties: he was the grandson of legendary cornetist and bandleader Professor James Brown Humphrey and the son of touring clarinetist Willie Humphrey Sr., with brothers Percy (trumpet) and Earl (trombone) also becoming prominent jazz musicians.[1][6][7] Humphrey first studied violin, then switched to trumpet under his grandfather’s tutelage before finally settling on clarinet; he took his first professional job playing alongside his father in George McCullum’s band and soon appeared with groups like the Silver Leaf Orchestra and as leader of a 22‑piece orchestra at New Orleans University.[1][6]

In the late 1910s and 1920s, Humphrey began traveling widely, playing in bands that linked him to the early development of jazz along the Mississippi River. He worked with George Fihle (replacing Lorenzo Tio Jr.), joined Freddie Keppard’s ensemble, and performed in Lawrence Duhe’s “White Sox” band that featured King Oliver.[1] By 1920 he was playing with Amos Riley’s Tulane Band and later with Kid Rena, then in 1925 went up to St. Louis to work for Fate Marable, one of the key riverboat bandleaders.[1][6] Returning to New Orleans in the early 1930s, Humphrey taught in private schools, played in the Works Progress Administration band during the Depression, and toured and recorded with the Mills Blue Rhythm Band in 1935–36, a swing‑era big band associated with Lucky Millinder.[1] During World War II he served in a U.S. Navy band, and after the war he became a mainstay of the Eureka Brass Band and worked frequently with drummer and bandleader Paul Barbarin, including a notable 1955 New York tour.[1][6]

From the 1950s onward, Humphrey emerged as one of the most visible standard‑bearers of traditional New Orleans clarinet. In the 1960s he recorded for Riverside Records’ “Living Legends” series and toured Europe in 1967 with Billie and DeDe Pierce, helping to bring classic New Orleans jazz to new international audiences.[1] Beginning in 1969 he co‑led the Preservation Hall Jazz Band with his brother Percy, recording multiple albums for CBS and becoming closely identified with Preservation Hall’s mission to sustain the city’s early jazz traditions.[1][6][7] His 1974 album *New Orleans Clarinet* (Smoky Mary) is widely regarded as his finest recorded statement, showcasing his robust tone, blues feeling, and highly vocal, decorative approach to melody.[1][7] Humphrey continued performing into his nineties and, at the time of his death on June 7, 1994, in New Orleans, he was recognized as the city’s oldest performing jazz musician and a vital living link to the first generation of New Orleans jazz.[1][5][6]

- Before settling on clarinet, Humphrey started on violin and then switched to trumpet under his grandfather’s guidance, reflecting the broad instrumental training common in early New Orleans music families.[1]
