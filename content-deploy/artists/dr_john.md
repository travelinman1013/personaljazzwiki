## Biography
Malcolm John Rebennack Jr., universally known as Dr. John, was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, on November 20, 1941[2][7]. Growing up in a city steeped in musical tradition, he was exposed early to R&B, blues, and jazz through his father’s record and musical equipment repair shop[1]. By age seven, he was taking guitar lessons from Walter 'Papoose' Nelson and Roy Montrell, both of whom played with Fats Domino, and soon began performing with local gospel and R&B acts, even as a teenager during the era of segregation[1]. His early career saw him as a session musician at Cosimo Matassa’s J&M Studio, the heart of New Orleans R&B, where he played with and produced for artists like Professor Longhair, Frankie Ford, and Joe Tex[1]. A gunshot injury to his left hand in 1960 forced him to switch to piano, an instrument he mastered under the influence of Professor Longhair, whose Afro-Caribbean piano style became a hallmark of Dr. John’s sound[1].

In the mid-1960s, as the New Orleans music scene waned, Rebennack moved to Los Angeles and, with producer Harold Battiste, created the flamboyant persona of Dr. John the Night Tripper, inspired by a 19th-century voodoo healer[1][2]. His 1968 debut album, Gris-Gris, blended New Orleans R&B with psychedelic rock and voodoo mysticism, earning him a cult following and establishing his reputation as a unique cultural icon[1][2]. Over five decades, Dr. John released over 30 studio albums, won six Grammy Awards, and was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame[6]. His music remained deeply rooted in New Orleans traditions, even as he explored funk, soul, and jazz, and he became a passionate advocate for his hometown, especially after Hurricane Katrina[3]. Dr. John passed away on June 6, 2019, leaving behind a legacy as one of New Orleans’ most original and influential musicians[2][3].

## Fun Facts
- Dr. John’s stage name and persona were inspired by a real 19th-century Senegalese prince and voodoo healer who lived in New Orleans, known for his eccentric lifestyle and spiritual practices[2].
- After a gunshot injury ended his guitar career, he switched to piano and became one of the instrument’s most distinctive stylists, blending Professor Longhair’s techniques with his own innovations[1].
- He was one of the few white musicians to play a significant role in New Orleans’ African American R&B scene during the height of segregation, often facing police harassment for breaking racial barriers[1][3].
- Dr. John’s 2008 album City That Care Forgot, a response to Hurricane Katrina, won a Grammy for Best Contemporary Blues Album and featured collaborations with Eric Clapton, Willie Nelson, and others[3].
