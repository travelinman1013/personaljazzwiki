## Biography
Meshell Ndegeocello, born Michelle Lynn Johnson on August 29, 1968, in Berlin, Germany, to a military family, was raised in Washington, D.C., where she immersed herself in the local go-go music scene during the late 1980s, playing with bands like Prophecy, Little Benny and the Masters, and Rare Essence. A self-taught bassist, she honed her skills and adopted her stage name, meaning 'free as a bird' in Swahili, reflecting her androgynous persona and poetic sensibilities. Signed as one of the first artists to Madonna's Maverick Records, she released her Grammy-nominated debut album *Plantation Lullabies* in 1993, blending neo-soul, hip-hop, funk, and politically charged lyrics that challenged norms around race, sexuality, and identity.[1][3][7]

Her career evolved across genres including jazz, R&B, rock, and reggae, marked by hits like the 1999 duet 'Wild Night' with John Mellencamp, which peaked at No. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100, and contributions to Madonna's *Bedtime Stories*. Albums like *Peace Beyond Passion* (1996), *Cookie: The Anthropological Mixtape* (2002), and recent works such as *The Omnichord Real Book* (2023) and *No More Water: The Gospel of James Baldwin* (2024) showcase her fearless creativity and multi-instrumental prowess on bass, keyboards, drums, and guitar. A three-time Grammy winner, including Best Alternative Jazz Album for *The Omnichord Real Book* (2024) and *No More Water* (2025), she has earned critical acclaim for defying expectations as a queer Black woman artist over three decades.[1][3][4][5]

Ndegeocello's legacy lies in her genre-blending innovation, social consciousness, and trailblazing authenticity, influencing neo-soul and jazz while prioritizing artistic expression over commercial success. Her Blue Note Records debut and collaborations underscore her enduring impact as a visionary bassist and songwriter.[2][4][5]
