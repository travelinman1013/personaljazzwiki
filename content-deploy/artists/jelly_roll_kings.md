## Biography
The Jelly Roll Kings were an American electric Delta blues band known for their raw, unvarnished sound that captured the spirit of Mississippi's rural juke joints. The group was formed by Frank Frost (keyboard/harmonica), Big Jack Johnson (guitar), and Sam Carr (drums), all of whom had deep roots in the Delta blues tradition. They began playing together irregularly from 1962 into the 1970s under the name The Nighthawks before officially recording as The Jelly Roll Kings in 1979. Their debut album, *Rockin' the Juke Joint Down*, was the first release for the Earwig Music Company and helped establish their reputation as purveyors of authentic, gritty blues. The band's music featured lilting rhythms, dreamy keyboards, and dance-shuffle drums, blending traditional Delta blues with a modern edge. Their 1997 album *Off Yonder Wall*, produced by Robert Palmer and released by Fat Possum Records, further cemented their legacy and brought their sound to a wider audience.

The Jelly Roll Kings were celebrated for their ability to breathe new life into classic blues standards while also crafting original material that resonated with both longtime fans and new listeners. Their performances were marked by a sense of spontaneity and joy, with Frost's eccentric organ style and Johnson's tasteful guitar licks standing out as key elements of their sound. The band's music served as a reminder of a time when blues was played in rural roadhouses, often accompanied by gambling and moonshine. After the deaths of Frank Frost in 1999, Sam Carr in 2009, and Big Jack Johnson in 2011, the group's legacy continued to influence the blues scene, with their recordings remaining essential listening for fans of the genre.
