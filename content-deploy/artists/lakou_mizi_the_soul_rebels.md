# Lakou Mizi, The Soul Rebels

## Biography
Lakou Mizik is a multigenerational collective of Haitian musicians formed in the aftermath of Haiti's devastating 2010 earthquake. The band was conceived on a hot November night in Port-au-Prince when guitarist and singer Steeve Valcourt, singer Jonas Attis, and American producer Zach Niles met in Valcourt's basement studio with a shared vision: to use Haiti's music and culture as an antidote to the flood of negative international media coverage surrounding the earthquake, cholera epidemic, and political crisis that gripped the nation. Over the following years, the collective assembled an exceptional lineup of singers, rara horn players, drummers, guitarists, and accordionists, honing their electrifying live shows that blended the soulful spirit of church revivals, the social engagement of political rallies, and the trance-inducing spirituality of vodou rituals.

After building a devoted local fanbase, Lakou Mizik recorded their critically acclaimed debut album 'Wa Di Yo' at the Artists Institute in Jacmel, a recording studio and music school built by the We Are the World Foundation. The album reflected the African, French, Caribbean, and U.S. influences that collide in Haiti, featuring spirit-stirring vodou rhythms, call-and-response vocals, French café accordion, intricate bass lines, interlocking guitar riffs, and socially conscious lyrics. The band's success led to international tours and recognition as one of Haiti's hottest exports, with their positive messages and roots revival music gaining a devoted global following.

In 2017, Lakou Mizik was invited to perform at the legendary New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, an experience that inspired their groundbreaking second album 'HaitiaNola' (2019). This unique project brought together the Haitian collective with a stellar lineup of New Orleans artists, exploring the deep historical and cultural connections between Haiti and New Orleans—connections forged when Haitian refugees fleeing the 1804 revolution doubled New Orleans' population and forever changed its ethnic and cultural identity. Produced by GRAMMY-winning producer Eric Heigle, 'HaitiaNola' fused Mardi Gras and Kanaval traditions, resulting in a gritty, funk-fueled album that showcased the band's ability to bridge two rich musical traditions.

## Fun Facts
- The band was conceived during a particularly turbulent moment in Haiti's history—on a November night in 2010 when the country was simultaneously dealing with earthquake aftermath, a raging cholera epidemic, and a political crisis so severe that tire-burning protests had closed the international airport.
- Nadine, one of the collective's most powerful roots singers, initially struggled with singing vodou tradition songs due to her Christian background and concerns about her family's reaction, but eventually gained their support and became a core member of the group.
- The album 'HaitiaNola' was directly inspired by the historical connection between Haiti and New Orleans: when Haitian slaves successfully rebelled against French masters in 1804, thousands of refugees—including French colonists, freed people of color, and slaves—fled to New Orleans, doubling the city's population and forever changing its cultural identity.
- Arcade Fire's Régine Chassagne, whose parents are Haitian immigrants, co-founded the Krewe du Kanaval (a Mardi Gras collective celebrating Haiti-New Orleans connections) and stated 'Wherever I go in New Orleans I feel Haiti' when describing the shared cultural bonds explored in HaitiaNola.
