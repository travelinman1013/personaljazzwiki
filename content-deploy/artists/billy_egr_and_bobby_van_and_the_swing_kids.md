## Biography
Billy Egr & Bobby Van & The Swing Kids appear to be a musical group active in the late 1960s and into the 1990s, primarily known for their Christmas and country-tinged holiday recordings. They are best documented through their inclusion on Numero Group’s compilation 'Christmas Dreamers: Yuletide Country (1960–1972)', which highlights their work in the yuletide country genre. Their most notable track, 'What Would Santa Claus Think,' released with Billy Egr as the featured vocalist, exemplifies their playful, retro-styled holiday sound that blends country, pop, and swing influences. The group’s recordings have since become cult favorites among collectors of obscure and nostalgic Christmas music, appreciated for their charm and period-specific production.

Despite their distinctive name, detailed biographical information about the individual members, particularly Billy Egr and the members of The Swing Kids, is extremely limited in major reference sources. Bobby Van in this context is not the well-known Broadway and film actor Bobby Van (1928–1980), but rather a different musician sharing the same name, associated with a band called The Swing Kids (sometimes referred to as The Swing Kings in video credits). The group’s legacy rests largely on their holiday recordings, which have been rediscovered and celebrated in niche music circles for their nostalgic appeal and unique place in the landscape of American Christmas music from the late 20th century.
