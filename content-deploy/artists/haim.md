## Biography
Haim is an American pop rock band formed by sisters Este, Danielle, and Alana Haim in Los Angeles, California. Raised in a musical family, the sisters began playing instruments at a young age, first performing in a family cover band called Rockinhaim with their parents, Moti and Donna. Este and Danielle initially joined the pop group Valli Girls in 2005, but soon left to pursue their own musical direction. The trio officially formed Haim in 2007, though they did not pursue it professionally until 2012, after Danielle gained experience touring with artists like Jenny Lewis and Julian Casablancas.

Haim's music blends elements of 1970s soft rock, 1980s synth-pop, and classic R&B, creating a genre-crossing sound that is both nostalgic and modern. Their debut album, 'Days Are Gone' (2013), received critical acclaim and commercial success, featuring hits like 'The Wire.' Subsequent albums, including 'Something to Tell You' (2017) and 'Women in Music Pt. III' (2020), further established their reputation for innovative songwriting and musicianship. The band is noted for their energetic live performances, which often showcase a more rock-oriented sound than their studio recordings.

Haim has become a significant force in contemporary music, earning Grammy nominations and collaborating with major artists such as Taylor Swift. Their legacy is marked by their commitment to authenticity, their embrace of their Jewish heritage, and their influence on a new generation of female-led alternative bands. The sisters remain proud of their roots, often referencing their family and cultural background in interviews and music.
