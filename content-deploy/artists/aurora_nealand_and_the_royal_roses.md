## Biography
Aurora Nealand, born on May 28 in Pacifica, California, grew up in a musical family listening to Preservation Hall Jazz Band alongside Stravinsky, Joan Baez, and the Pixies. She experimented on her mother's piano, played flute and oboe in school band, and developed a tomboyish spirit with her brother Tosh, but lacked formal training until college, where her mother encouraged self-learning. After her brother's death in high school, she attended Oberlin Conservatory, earning a music composition degree, picked up saxophone, and studied at the Jacques Lecoq School of Physical Theatre in Paris. A cross-country bicycle trip collecting audio stories led her to New Orleans in 2004-2005, where she biked nightly to Frenchmen Street, gigged with bands like Some Like It Hot, and immersed in traditional jazz, jazz manouche, Balkan/Klezmer, and improvisation despite Hurricane Katrina's impact.[1][5][2]

Settling in New Orleans, Nealand played as a sideman in Panorama Jazz Band, VaVaVoom, and The New Orleans Moonshiners before forming The Royal Roses in 2010, a non-traditional traditional jazz band drawing from Sidney Bechet, Louis Armstrong, Bessie Smith, and New Orleans heritage with innovative collective improvisation linking early jazz to AACM and sound art. Their debut album, 'A Tribute to Sydney Bechet: Live at Preservation Hall,' earned national acclaim, and she was voted a Downbeat Magazine top ten rising star on soprano saxophone. She leads other projects like Rory Danger and the Danger Dangers (rockabilly), The Monocle (solo), redrawblak Trio, and co-founded SONO for new music workshops, while appearing in HBO's 'Treme' and touring festivals worldwide.[1][2][3][8]

Nealand's style spans traditional New Orleans jazz revival, avant-garde rock, free improvisation, and interdisciplinary work like her 2019/2020 theatrical show 'KindHumanKind' and City Songs Project. Voted Best Saxophonist, Best Female Performer, and Best Traditional Jazz Band in Big Easy/OffBeat Awards (2015-2016), she has residencies at MacDowell Colony, Atlantic Center for the Arts, and New Orleans Contemporary Arts Center, and facilitates with Found Sound Nation on projects like Dosti and LADAMA.[2][3][6]
