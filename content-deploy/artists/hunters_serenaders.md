## Biography
Hunter's Serenaders was a pioneering jazz and dance band led by Lloyd Hunter, an influential African American trumpeter and bandleader from North Omaha, Nebraska. Formed in the late 1920s, the group became one of the most prominent territory bands in the Midwest, performing extensively throughout Nebraska, Iowa, Kansas, and Missouri. Their energetic performances and polished arrangements made them a staple at dances, clubs, and theaters during the swing era. In 1931, Lloyd Hunter's Serenaders became the first Omaha-based band to record, marking a significant milestone for the region's music scene.[6][7]

The band's style blended elements of early jazz, ragtime, and swing, reflecting the evolving tastes of American popular music in the pre-war years. Lloyd Hunter's leadership and musical direction attracted talented musicians, some of whom would go on to achieve national recognition. Despite the challenges of the Great Depression and the racial barriers of the time, Hunter's Serenaders maintained a strong regional presence and contributed to the development of jazz in the Midwest. Their legacy is remembered as a vital link in the history of American jazz, particularly for their role in elevating the profile of African American musicians from Nebraska and the surrounding states.[4][5][6]
