## Biography
Pearl Mae Bailey (March 29, 1918 – August 17, 1990) was an American singer, actress, comedian, and author whose warm, husky voice and relaxed, humorous stage presence made her one of the most beloved entertainers of the mid‑20th century.[1][5] Born in Newport News, Virginia, to Pentecostal minister Rev. Joseph James Bailey and Ella Mae Bailey, she began singing in her father’s church choir as a small child, an experience she later credited with shaping her vocal style.[1][4][10] As a teenager in Philadelphia, she won an amateur contest at the Pearl Theatre at age 15 and another at Harlem’s Apollo Theater, prompting her to leave high school and pursue show business full time in Black nightclubs, vaudeville circuits, and East Coast cafes during the 1930s.[1][4][5] During World War II she toured with the USO, entertaining American troops and further refining her trademark mix of song and sly, conversational comedy.[4][5]

Bailey’s national breakthrough came in the 1940s, when she sang with big bands led by Cootie Williams, Count Basie, and later worked on bills with Cab Calloway and Duke Ellington, gaining attention for her sultry phrasing and behind‑the‑beat swing feel.[1][5][8] Her Broadway debut in “St. Louis Woman” (1946) earned her a Donaldson Award for best newcomer and led to a string of stage, film, and recording successes, including films such as “Variety Girl” (1947), “Carmen Jones” (1954), and “Porgy and Bess” (1959), and hit records like “Takes Two to Tango” (1952) and “Toot Toot Tootsie, Goodbye” (1953).[1][2][4][8] She became a familiar television personality through frequent guest appearances and her own program, “The Pearl Bailey Show” (1971).[1][6] In 1967 she took on what became her signature role, Dolly Gallagher Levi, headlining an all‑Black production of “Hello, Dolly!” on Broadway; her performance won a Special Tony Award and toured extensively across the United States and Canada.[1][2][5][6]

Known stylistically for her intimate, talk‑sing approach, comic timing, and ability to blur the lines between cabaret, jazz, and Broadway, Bailey projected warmth and ease while still commanding musical authority.[1][6] She recorded prolifically for several labels, worked for decades on stage and screen, and later in life completed a theology degree from Georgetown University at age 67, a reflection of her enduring interest in faith and learning.[2] Beyond entertainment, she served as a sort of cultural ambassador, receiving the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Ronald Reagan in recognition of her contributions to American arts and public life.[2] Pearl Bailey died in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1990, leaving a legacy as a versatile performer who opened doors for Black artists on Broadway and on television while defining a uniquely personal, humorous approach to the American songbook.[1][2][5]
