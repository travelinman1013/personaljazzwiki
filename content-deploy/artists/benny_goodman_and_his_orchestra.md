## Biography
Benny Goodman, born May 30, 1909 in Chicago, Illinois, was the ninth child of Jewish immigrants and grew up in a poor neighborhood where his father encouraged his musical pursuits[6]. Goodman began playing clarinet at a young age and quickly demonstrated exceptional talent, joining Ben Pollack's Orchestra at age 16 and making his first recordings in 1926[1]. By the early 1930s, Goodman was recording under his own name and, with the guidance of producer John Hammond, formed his own orchestra in 1934[2][3]. His band's innovative sound, shaped by arrangements from Fletcher Henderson, propelled Goodman to national fame after a landmark performance at the Palomar Ballroom in Los Angeles in 1935, widely considered the start of the swing era[2][3].

Goodman's orchestra became the leading force in swing music, featuring star soloists like Gene Krupa and Harry James, and producing hits such as "Don't Be That Way," "Stompin' at the Savoy," and "Goody Goody"[2]. He broke racial barriers by integrating his bands, notably with pianist Teddy Wilson and vibraphonist Lionel Hampton, and made history with the first jazz concert at Carnegie Hall in 1938[7][9]. Throughout his career, Goodman led various ensembles, including trios, quartets, and sextets, and continued to perform and record, even as big band jazz waned after World War II[4].

Goodman's musical style was characterized by virtuosic clarinet playing, tight ensemble work, and sophisticated arrangements that blended jazz improvisation with popular dance rhythms. His legacy as the "King of Swing" endures, not only for his technical mastery and popular success but also for his role in elevating jazz as a respected art form and fostering the careers of many future jazz greats[5][8].
