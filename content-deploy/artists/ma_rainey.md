## Biography
Gertrude 'Ma' Rainey, born Gertrude Malissa Nix Pridgett on April 26, 1886, in Columbus, Georgia, emerged from a family of minstrel performers and began her career in vaudeville and tent shows as a teenager. She married William 'Pa' Rainey in 1904, and together they toured Southern cabarets and circuses as 'Ma' and 'Pa' Rainey, where by 1905 she encountered authentic country blues during her travels, incorporating it into her repertoire and earning the title 'Mother of the Blues' as the first popular stage entertainer to do so.[1][3][5][6]

Rainey's career peaked in the 1920s blues craze; she signed with Paramount Records in 1923 through producer Mayo 'Ink' Williams, recording nearly 100 sides over five years, including hits like 'Bo-Weevil Blues,' 'See See Rider Blues,' and 'Ma Rainey's Black Bottom.' Her deep contralto voice, moaning style, and flamboyant performances—featuring gold teeth, flashy attire, and vaudeville flair—bridged rural Southern blues with urban audiences, often backed by top musicians in various settings from jug bands to jazz ensembles.[2][3][4][6]

After her recording contract ended around 1928 due to shifting tastes, Rainey toured into the 1930s, then retired to Columbus following family deaths, managing theaters and engaging in church activities until her death from a heart attack on December 22, 1939. Her legacy as a pioneer of classic blues influenced generations, with posthumous honors including Blues and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductions and a 2023 Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.[2][5][6]
