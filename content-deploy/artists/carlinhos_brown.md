## Biography
Antônio Carlos Santos de Freitas, known professionally as Carlinhos Brown, was born on November 23, 1962, in the Candeal Pequeno de Brotas community, an African Quilombo resistance area in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil. Growing up in this vibrant Afro-Brazilian neighborhood, he discovered percussion early, influenced by local samba groups and religious festivities. At age 17 in 1979, he began his professional career following Mestre Pintado do Bongô, a percussion leader, and soon performed with established artists while composing for carnival groups like Zimbabwe and bands such as Mar Revolto.[1][3][8]

In the 1980s, Brown played a pivotal role in pioneering axé music and samba-reggae, contributing to Luís Caldas's Acordes Verdes band and composing hits like 'Visão de Cíclope,' 'Cadê Meu Coco,' and 'Yayá Maravilha' at WR Studios. He collaborated with Caetano Veloso on the 1989 album Estrangeiro, co-writing the hit 'Meia Lua Inteira,' which earned a Caymmi trophy and led to world tours with João Gilberto, Djavan, and others. Brown founded Timbalada in the early 1990s to revitalize Salvador's Carnival, innovating with percussion-focused parades and the Mr. Brown Trio Elétrico, while releasing his debut album Alfagamabetizado in 1996 and forming the supergroup Tribalistas with Marisa Monte and Arnaldo Antunes in 2002, whose self-titled album spawned massive hits like 'Já Sei Namorar.'[1][3][4][6]

Brown's style fuses traditional Brazilian percussion with funk, Latin music, R&B, soul, reggae, and global influences from Angola, Cuba, and artists like James Brown, creating over 800 registered songs. A social innovator, he established a musical school, recording studio, and museum in Candeal to promote rhythmic revitalization and community development, cementing his legacy as a driving force in axé music and Bahian culture.[1][2][3]
