## Biography
Craig Klein is a New Orleans-born trombonist whose musical journey is deeply rooted in the city's rich cultural heritage. Growing up in New Orleans, Klein was immersed in a diverse array of music from an early age, with his love for the city's sound solidified during his teenage years while frequenting Preservation Hall and the French Quarter. He began playing trombone in the third grade and quickly became involved in local music scenes, joining the Pair-A-Dice Tumblers as a young musician and later co-founding two prominent brass bands: The Storyville Stompers (1981) and The New Orleans NightCrawlers (1994). Klein's career took a major leap in 1990 when he joined Harry Connick, Jr.'s band, embarking on a 16-year tenure that included extensive world tours and recordings. In 2006, he left Connick's band to focus on Bonerama, a trombone-driven ensemble that blended New Orleans brass traditions with contemporary influences. Klein is known for his versatility, adaptability, and commitment to the spirit of New Orleans music, performing across genres and collaborating with a wide range of artists. His legacy includes a vast discography, Grammy-winning work, and a dedication to preserving and mentoring the next generation of New Orleans musicians.
