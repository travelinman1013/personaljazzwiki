## Biography
Arthur James 'Zutty' Singleton was born on May 14, 1898, in Bunkie, Louisiana, and grew up primarily in New Orleans, where he became a self-taught drummer immersed in the local jazz scene. As a young musician, he played with early New Orleans figures like Oscar 'Papa' Celestin, 'Big Eye' Louis Nelson Delisle, Steve Louis, the Tuxedo Jazz Band, the Maple Leaf Band, and riverboat bandleader Fate Marable. In 1917, he migrated to Chicago amid the jazz boom, performing with Doc Cook, Dave Payton, and Jimmie Noone before gaining national prominence through 1920s recordings with Louis Armstrong's Hot Five and Hot Seven, which showcased his innovative timekeeping.[1][3][5][7]

Singleton's career spanned styles from traditional New Orleans jazz to swing and bebop, working in New York with Armstrong, Fats Waller, Sidney Bechet, Jelly Roll Morton, Pee Wee Russell, Wingy Manone, and Buster Bailey; in the 1930s with Roy Eldridge; and later with Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie. He led his own bands, including Zutty and His Band on Decca, and relocated to Los Angeles in 1943. Renowned for his supple, melodic drumming—following improvisational lines closely—Singleton used a modest kit (snare, bass drum, two toms, 2-3 cymbals) and pioneered techniques like the snare press roll on beats two and four, wire brushes, hi-hat, and early ride cymbal use, influencing modern jazz beats while retaining a four-beat bass drum pulse rooted in New Orleans idiom.[1][3][4][5]

A stroke sidelined Singleton in 1969; he died in New York on July 14, 1975. His legacy endures as a jazz drumming pioneer, honored with the 1974 Gene Krupa Award and 1975 NARAS Hall of Fame induction for Armstrong Hot Five recordings, influencing swing drummers like Dave Tough, George Wettling, and Sid Catlett.[1][4][5]
