## Biography
Jalen Ngonda (often stylized Jalen N’Gonda) is an American retro-soul singer, songwriter, and multi‑instrumentalist known for his Motown‑inspired sound. Born in the mid‑1990s in Maryland, just outside Washington, D.C., he grew up in a music‑loving family, first studying violin in grade school before moving on to guitar and piano.[3][6] His father’s collection of Motown CDs — including The Temptations, Mary Wells, and Smokey Robinson & the Miracles — sparked an early obsession with 1950s–70s soul, R&B, and pop, and by his early teens he was writing his own songs, largely playing and composing by ear.[1][3][5] Around 2014 he relocated to the UK to study at Liverpool’s Institute of Performing Arts, quickly finding a musical community there and eventually basing himself in London.[6][9]

Ngonda began performing in small venues and open mics, releasing early material such as a 2016 EP that introduced his blend of soul, blues, and jazz, and steadily building a reputation on the live circuit.[7] He went on to appear at major events including New York’s SummerStage, Pickathon, Newport Folk Festival, and the Montreal Jazz Festival (opening for Laura Mvula and Lauryn Hill), as well as selling out headline shows in Germany, the UK, and Switzerland.[3] In 2022 he signed with Brooklyn’s Daptone Records, and in 2023 released his debut album *Come Around and Love Me*, an 11‑track set steeped in the spirit of Motown, Stax, and Philadelphia soul that nonetheless foregrounds his own contemporary songwriting voice.[2][3][6] The album reached the UK charts and topped the UK Independent Album Breakers Chart, earning critical acclaim and praise from high‑profile artists including Snoop Dogg, Kehlani, Olivia Dean, and Elton John, who named the title track among his favorite songs of 2023 and called Ngonda an artist to watch.[2][4]

Musically, Ngonda’s work is often described as modern or retro soul, balancing raw emotional intensity with an elegant, controlled vocal delivery.[3][5] His guitar‑centered songwriting process draws heavily on 1960s soul, early rock ’n’ roll, and classic pop — from Sam Cooke, Marvin Gaye, and Smokey Robinson to the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, and the Beach Boys — yet he emphasizes that he is a 21st‑century artist, channeling vintage influences without resorting to pastiche.[3][5] Critics have noted that his recordings could be mistaken for lost gems from the golden age of soul, and by the mid‑2020s outlets such as *Rolling Stone* were highlighting him as one of the leading figures in the current soul revival, underscoring his growing impact on contemporary R&B and soul audiences.[2]

## Fun Facts
- Ngonda began his musical life on the violin in grade school before switching his focus to guitar and later piano, but he still largely plays and writes by ear rather than relying on formal notation.[1][3]
- As a middle‑school student he was so focused on songwriting that he would fill notebook pages with love‑song lyrics during class instead of doing schoolwork.[1]
- From around age 11 he would ask his mother to take him to the mall specifically so he could buy CDs by classic acts like The Supremes, preferring 1950s–70s music over contemporary pop.[5]
- Elton John selected the title track of *Come Around and Love Me* as one of his favorite songs of 2023 and publicly predicted that Ngonda is “going to be a huge star.”[2][4]
