## Biography
Arthur Lee Conley was born on January 4, 1946, in McIntosh, Georgia, and raised in Atlanta, where he began his musical journey early. At age 12, he recorded with Arthur and the Corvets on the NRG label and later joined the all-female gospel group The Evening Smiles, releasing singles like 'Poor Girl' and 'I Believe'. In 1964, he moved to Baltimore, recording 'I'm A Lonely Stranger' with his father for Ru-Jac Records, which caught the attention of Otis Redding, leading to a pivotal re-recording at Stax Studios produced by Jim Stewart with Booker T.'s arrangements.[1][2][5]

## Fun Facts
- Conley legally changed his name to Lee Roberts in 1980 after moving to the Netherlands to live more openly as a gay man, away from U.S. pressures, and continued music with Lee Roberts & the Sweaters.[1][2]
- "Sweet Soul Music" was a reworking of Sam Cooke's "Yeah Man", serving as a 1967 roll call shout-out to soul stars like Otis Redding, James Brown, Wilson Pickett, Lou Rawls, and Sam & Dave.[1][2]
- Otis Redding ensured Conley received royalties from all his songs before his death, providing financial security for Conley's new life in Europe.[2]
- He toured as a guest opener on the 1967 Stax/Volt Revue with Redding, Booker T. & the MG’s, and Sam & Dave, despite some label tensions over his ATCO affiliation.[2]
