## Biography
Odd the Artist is a New Orleans–based rapper, singer, DJ, producer, songwriter, and entrepreneur who blends hip-hop, R&B, rock, and electronic elements into a highly personal soundscape.[4][6] Raised in the greater New Orleans area, she grew up surrounded by the city’s rich musical culture and the legacy of Southern hip-hop, while also gravitating toward rock and alternative sounds that shaped her performance style and fashion sense.[6] This duality—equal parts hip-hop and rock star—has become central to her artistic identity, both onstage and in the studio.[6]

She began gaining notice on the local scene through energetic live performances, DJ sets, and independently released tracks that highlighted her versatility as both a vocalist and a rapper.[4][6] Odd the Artist writes, records, and produces much of her own material, using her multi-hyphenate skill set to maintain creative control over her sound and visual brand.[4] Her songs often weave melodic hooks with introspective verses, delivered over genre-blurring productions that pull from trap, rock guitars, and club-ready rhythms.[6] As her reputation has grown, she has steadily built a grassroots following around New Orleans, positioning herself as a rising independent artist committed to carving out her own lane rather than conforming to a single genre.[4][6]

In addition to her work as a recording artist, Odd the Artist is active as a DJ and performer in the New Orleans nightlife and live music circuit, where her sets and shows showcase both her curatorial ear and stage charisma.[4][6] She treats each performance as an immersive experience, blending her original music with carefully selected tracks that reflect her eclectic influences.[6] While still early in her career, her multi-disciplinary approach—artist, producer, DJ, and entrepreneur—has begun to establish a model of self-directed artistry for younger local peers who see in her an example of how to independently build a brand in the contemporary music landscape.[4][6]
