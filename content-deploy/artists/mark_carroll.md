## Biography
Marc Carroll, born on 25 January 1972 in Dublin, Ireland, began his musical career in 1989 as the sole songwriter and founding member of the power/punk band Puppy Love Bomb. Returning to Dublin in 1990 after time away, the band gained notoriety for ferocious live shows and provocative merchandise like 'Dublin Is Dead' T-shirts, recording radio sessions for Dave Fanning and touring Europe with Bob Mould's Sugar. They signed with Rough Trade, releasing three singles and two EPs produced by Martin Carr of The Boo Radleys. In 1996, Carroll formed The Hormones in London, serving as sole songwriter with a sound blending Teenage Fanclub and Stiff Little Fingers, signing to V2 and releasing five singles, including 'Mr. Wilson,' a tribute to Brian Wilson.[1]

Transitioning to a solo career in 1999, Carroll signed with Universal Music and released his debut album *Ten of Swords* in 2002, playing all instruments and co-producing with Adi Winman, with contributions from former Smiths guitarist Craig Gannon. His style evolved into folk rock, alternative rock, and instrumental music, drawing from influences like Bob Dylan, Brian Wilson, The Beach Boys, Buffalo Springfield, and American music traditions. Subsequent albums included *All Wrongs Reversed* (2005 on Evangeline), a retrospective on One Little Indian (2011), *Stone Beads & Silver* (2013, recorded in Los Angeles, Burbank, and Levon Helm's Woodstock studio), and *Love Is All Or Love Is Not At All* (2015).[1][2][5]

Carroll's career spans labels like Rough Trade, V2, Universal, and One Little Indian, with 7 albums and 23 singles as a multi-instrumentalist on vocals, guitar, bass, keyboards, piano, and percussion. His work reflects a DIY ethos inspired by outsiders like Chuck Berry, Sex Pistols, and Crass, emphasizing melody and storytelling amid industry challenges.[1][5]
