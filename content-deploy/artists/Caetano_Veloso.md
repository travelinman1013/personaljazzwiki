## Biography
Caetano Veloso, born on August 7, 1942, in Santo Amaro da Purificação, Bahia, Brazil, is a seminal figure in Brazilian music, renowned as a composer, singer, guitarist, writer, and political activist. Raised in a culturally rich family, Veloso was deeply influenced by the musical traditions of Bahia and the bossa nova movement, particularly the work of João Gilberto. He began performing in Salvador alongside his sister Maria Bethânia and other future luminaries, such as Gilberto Gil and Gal Costa, while studying philosophy at the Federal University of Bahia in the early 1960s. 

Veloso's career took off in the mid-1960s as he became a driving force behind the Tropicália movement, which fused traditional Brazilian music with international influences like rock and avant-garde poetry. His early albums, including the collaborative 'Domingo' with Gal Costa, showcased his bossa nova roots, but his work soon grew more experimental and politically charged. The military dictatorship in Brazil viewed his activism and music as subversive, leading to his imprisonment and subsequent exile in London with Gilberto Gil in 1969. After returning to Brazil in 1972, Veloso continued to innovate, earning international acclaim and numerous awards, including multiple Latin Grammys and Grammy Awards. His legacy is marked by his fearless artistic experimentation, his role in shaping modern Brazilian popular music (MPB), and his enduring influence across generations and genres.
