## Biography
Leroy 'Roy' Buchanan was born on September 23, 1939, in Ozark, Arkansas, and raised in Pixley, California, where his father worked as a farmer and Pentecostal preacher, exposing him to gospel music at racially mixed revival meetings. Captivated by late-night R&B radio broadcasts, he began playing steel guitar at age seven, switching to electric guitar by 13, particularly favoring the Fender Telecaster, which became his signature instrument. At 15, he ran away to Los Angeles, joining the thriving blues and R&B scene, where he was mentored by bandleader Johnny Otis and studied under guitarists like Jimmy Nolen, Pete Lewis, and Johnny 'Guitar' Watson[1][2][3][4].

Buchanan's career as a sideman took off in the late 1950s, recording with Dale Hawkins on hits like 'My Babe' (1958) for Chess Records, then joining Ronnie Hawkins in 1961, where he mentored bass player Robbie Robertson. He pioneered his trademark harmonics on 'Potato Peeler' (1962) with Bobby Gregg and formed The Snakestretchers in the mid-1960s near Washington, D.C. A 1971 PBS documentary, *The Best Unknown Guitarist in the World*, launched his solo career with Polydor (five albums, one gold) and later Atlantic (three albums, one gold), blending blues, country, jazz, and rock with innovative Telecaster tones[1][3][4][5]. Frustrated by major-label production, he quit recording in 1981 but returned with Alligator Records in 1985, releasing *When a Guitar Plays the Blues* (Grammy-nominated, Billboard chart), *Dancing on the Edge* (1986), and *Hot Wires* (1988)[1][4].

Despite commercial challenges and personal struggles with addiction, Buchanan's subtle tone, lyrical leads, and harmonic mastery earned him cult status as a guitar innovator, influencing generations without mainstream stardom. He died on August 14, 1988[2][3][4].
