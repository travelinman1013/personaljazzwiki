## Biography
Sandile Fortune Msimango, known professionally as Young Stunna, is a South African singer and songwriter who has become one of the leading voices in the amapiano genre. Born in Daveyton, Gauteng, he grew up in a musically rich environment—his mother was a vocalist and his father owned a tavern with a jukebox, exposing him to a variety of genres from an early age. Raised in a Christian household, he sang in the church choir and began experimenting with music as a child, recording his first song in fifth grade and performing in school events.[1][2][3]

Initially pursuing hip-hop from 2012, Young Stunna was inspired by the burgeoning amapiano movement and artists such as DJ Maphorisa, Mpura, Kamo Mphela, Njelic, and especially Focalistic. He made a significant transition to amapiano, joining the Piano Hub label in 2021. His breakthrough came with the hit single "Bopha" and his debut album 'Notumato,' which topped South African charts and was certified Platinum. His single "Adiwele" became a national anthem, reaching number one on South African radio with over 23 million impressions. Stunna's music is characterized by its blend of amapiano rhythms, kwaito influences, and lyrical storytelling rooted in his personal experiences.[1][2][3][4]

Young Stunna's rapid ascent has made him a central figure in the new wave of South African music, collaborating with top producers and artists while maintaining a unique voice. His legacy is already evident in his ability to bridge genres and inspire a new generation of musicians, as well as his role in bringing amapiano to international prominence.[1][3][4]
