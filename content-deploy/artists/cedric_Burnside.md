## Biography
Cedric Burnside, born August 26, 1978, in Memphis, Tennessee, and raised in North Mississippi’s Marshall and Benton Counties, is a celebrated American blues drummer, guitarist, singer, and songwriter. As the grandson of Hill Country blues legend R.L. Burnside and son of drummer Calvin Jackson, Cedric was immersed in the region’s musical traditions from an early age. He began playing drums on household objects before receiving his first drum set from his grandfather at age twelve. By thirteen, he was touring internationally as the drummer in R.L. Burnside’s band, absorbing the nuances of the North Mississippi Hill Country blues style at juke joints and house parties across the South.[1][2][3][4][5]

Burnside’s career has spanned over three decades, during which he has become a pivotal figure in preserving and evolving the Hill Country blues tradition. He is known for his polyrhythmic percussion, hypnotic guitar riffs, and a vocal style that channels both ancestral blues stories and contemporary experiences. Cedric has released multiple solo and collaborative albums, including the Grammy-nominated 'Descendants of Hill Country' and 'Benton County Relic.' His 2021 album, 'I Be Trying,' further cements his reputation as a torchbearer and innovator, blending traditional blues with elements of funk, rock, soul, and hip-hop.[2][4]

Burnside’s music is deeply rooted in the Black American experience of the South, honoring the legacy of his forebears while pushing the genre forward for new generations. He has won numerous Blues Music Awards, including Best New Artist Debut and Best Instrumentalist for drums, and continues to inspire and mentor emerging artists, ensuring the vitality of the Hill Country blues for years to come.[1][2][5]
