## Biography
Gland is a hard rock and glam metal band known for channeling the decadent spirit of 1980s rock. The group was formed in 2007 in Green Bay, Wisconsin, when a group of friends, inspired by the energy and style of classic glam metal, decided to recreate the era's sound and spectacle. Their debut performance at Riders Saloon was met with enthusiastic support, prompting the band to continue and expand their lineup.

Initially a five-piece ensemble, Gland added a keyboardist in 2013, solidifying their six-member configuration. Their musical style is rooted in the glam metal tradition, characterized by catchy hooks, powerful guitar riffs, and theatrical stage presence. Drawing inspiration from legendary acts like Aerosmith, Alice Cooper, Cheap Trick, Kiss, The New York Dolls, and Van Halen, Gland has become a staple in the Midwest live music scene, performing high-energy shows that celebrate the glam metal legacy. Over nearly two decades, they have built a reputation for delivering authentic and entertaining tributes to the genre's heyday, keeping the spirit of 80s hard rock alive for new generations.
