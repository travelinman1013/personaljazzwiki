## Biography
Gabe Carter, often billed as **Mississippi Gabe Carter**, is a modern American blues musician rooted in the country blues tradition while based in Chicago. Born in South Bend, Indiana, and raised in rural southwest Michigan, he grew up as the only child of divorced parents, moving between small towns in the region.[3][4][6] Carter received his first guitar around age five, but did not become serious about the instrument until his teens, when he began learning by ear and immersing himself in pre‑war Mississippi and country blues recordings.[3][6] The combination of Midwestern small‑town life and early exposure to traditional blues helped shape the stark, devotional quality of his later work.[3][6]

After relocating to Chicago as an adult, Carter developed a raw, hypnotic solo style heavily informed by Delta and hill‑country blues, performing on resonator and acoustic guitars with a driving, percussive attack.[1][4] He has been featured in Chicago clubs and regional festivals, and his recordings—issued in part through his own imprint, Lord And Gabe Records—highlight minimalist arrangements, deep rhythmic vamps, and religiously inflected lyrics that reflect his strong Christian faith.[5] Contemporary coverage has placed him within the modern blues and blues‑rock ecosystem while emphasizing that his sound hews closely to older Mississippi traditions rather than slick, electric urban blues.[1][2] Though operating largely in the underground and independent scene, Carter has earned a reputation among aficionados for channeling early country blues idioms into a contemporary setting, keeping a devotional, rootsy strain of the genre alive.[1][5]
