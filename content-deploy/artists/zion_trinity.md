## Biography
Zion Trinity is a vocal and percussion trio from New Orleans, Louisiana, known for blending roots reggae with jazz, funk, African ritual music, and spiritually themed lyrics. Emerging from the city’s rich Afro-Caribbean and African American musical traditions, the group developed a sound that draws on Rastafarian spirituality, African diasporic rhythms, and New Orleans’ own history of Black sacred music and street-parade percussion.[2][5] Over time, they became recognized locally as cultural ambassadors, presenting reggae and African-inspired music within New Orleans’ festival, museum, and community-arts circuits.[1][2]

Throughout their career, Zion Trinity has performed in a wide range of venues, including museum concert series such as Friday Nights at the New Orleans Museum of Art (NOMA), where they were highlighted for their ability to move seamlessly between reggae, jazz, funk, and African ritual performance.[2] Their recordings, including tracks like “Oshun: Be Oni” featured on digital platforms, showcase a strong emphasis on pan-African spirituality and Orisha traditions, combining chant-like vocals with modern reggae grooves.[4] By consistently foregrounding African-derived religious and musical practices in a contemporary roots-reggae context, Zion Trinity has carved out a distinct niche in the New Orleans scene, contributing to the city’s reputation as a crossroads of Caribbean, African, and American musical cultures.[1][2][4]

While detailed individual member biographies are not widely documented in mainstream reference sources, available materials consistently present Zion Trinity as a collective rather than a star-centered act, focused on ensemble vocals, percussion, and ritual performance. Their legacy is most visible in New Orleans’ cultural landscape, where their appearances at events and on performance series position them as bridge-builders between community-based spiritual traditions, African diasporic ritual, and popular music performance.[1][2] Their work underscores the ongoing dialogue between New Orleans music and wider Afro-Caribbean and African spiritual sounds, helping sustain and publicize these traditions for local audiences and visitors alike.[1][2]
