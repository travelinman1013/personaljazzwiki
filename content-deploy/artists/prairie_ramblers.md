## Biography
The Prairie Ramblers were a pioneering American country and western string band originally formed as The Kentucky Ramblers in 1930 in Kewanee, Illinois. The group’s early lineup included Floyd “Salty” Holmes (guitar, harmonica, vocals), Jack Taylor (bass), Charles “Chick” Hurt (mandola/mandolin), and Shelby “Tex” Atchison (fiddle). Their big break came in 1933 when they moved to Chicago and joined the cast of WLS National Barn Dance, one of the era’s most influential radio shows. That same year, they recruited vocalist Patsy Montana, whose energetic cowgirl persona and yodeling style helped define the group’s sound and broadened their appeal, especially with her landmark hit "I Want To Be a Cowboy’s Sweetheart."

The Prairie Ramblers became known for their blend of country, hillbilly, cowboy, and early western swing styles, often incorporating jazz and pop influences. Their professional polish and warm, approachable sound made them favorites on radio and touring circuits throughout the 1930s and 1940s. They recorded prolifically, both under their own name and as The Sweet Violet Boys—a pseudonym used for more risqué, vaudeville-influenced material. The band was instrumental in popularizing country music to urban northern audiences and played a key role in the rise of the singing cowboy movement.

The group’s legacy is marked by their technical skill, innovative arrangements, and their role in launching the careers of both Patsy Montana and several of their own members. Their influence extended to later country and bluegrass musicians, notably inspiring Bill Monroe’s mandolin style. The Prairie Ramblers continued to perform and record until the mid-1950s, leaving behind a significant catalog and a lasting impact on American roots music.
