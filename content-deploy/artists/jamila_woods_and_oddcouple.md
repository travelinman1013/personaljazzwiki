## Biography
Jamila Woods is a Chicago-born singer, songwriter, and poet whose work is deeply rooted in the cultural and social fabric of her hometown. Raised on the city's South Side in both Washington Park and the suburb of Beverly Hills, Woods grew up in a family that valued both medicine and spirituality—her father is a physician and her mother a spiritual healer. She began singing in church as a child, which laid the foundation for her distinctive blend of alternative R&B, soul, and poetic lyricism. Woods attended St. Ignatius College Prep and later graduated from Brown University with a BA in Africana Studies and Theater & Performance Studies, where she further developed her artistic voice and commitment to social justice.[1][3][5]

Woods first gained recognition in the poetry world, publishing her chapbook 'The Truth About Dolls' in 2012 and contributing to several anthologies. She became a key figure in Chicago's youth arts scene as Associate Artistic Director of Young Chicago Authors, helping organize the influential Louder Than a Bomb poetry slam. Musically, she emerged as part of the soul-pop duo M&O (Milo & Otis) before launching a solo career. Her debut album 'HEAVN' (2016) and follow-up 'Legacy! Legacy!' (2019) received critical acclaim for their exploration of Black identity, ancestry, and self-love, featuring collaborations with artists like Chance the Rapper, Noname, Saba, and the producer oddCouple. Woods is celebrated for her ability to weave poetry and activism into her music, creating a legacy as both an artist and a mentor within Chicago's creative community.[1][2][3][7][9]

oddCouple (Zach Henderson) is a Chicago-based producer known for his innovative, genre-blending approach to hip-hop and R&B. He has become a sought-after collaborator in the Chicago music scene, working closely with Jamila Woods on tracks such as 'Teach Me,' where his production complements Woods' introspective songwriting. Together, Jamila Woods & oddCouple represent a dynamic partnership that exemplifies the collaborative spirit and progressive sound of contemporary Chicago music.[7][8][9]
