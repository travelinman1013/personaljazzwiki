## Biography
Ellen Rowe, born November 11, 1958, in Norwalk, CT, and raised in Ridgefield, CT, grew up in a musical family with both parents trained at the Juilliard School of Music. She developed her skills as a jazz pianist, composer, and educator, releasing albums under her own name including *Sylvan Way*, *Wishing Well*, *Denali Pass*, *Courage Music*, and *Momentum – Portraits of Women In Motion* (2019), which featured Ingrid Jensen, Tia Fuller, Marion Hayden, and Allison Miller. Her latest project, *Vinton's Cove* (released November 21, 2025), showcases original compositions and arrangements performed by her quartet with guest vocalist Sunny Wilkinson[1][2][3][9].

Rowe has built a distinguished career in jazz, performing at clubs and festivals across the U.S. and internationally in Europe, South Africa, Australia, and Brazil, while serving as a sideman with artists like Kenny Wheeler, Tim Ries, Tom Harrell, John Clayton, Ingrid Jensen, and Steve Turre. She appeared on Marian McPartland’s *Piano Jazz* on NPR and has toured with her trio, quartet, and quintet. Prior to her current role as Arthur F. Thurnau Professor of Jazz and Contemporary Improvisation at the University of Michigan's School of Music, Theatre & Dance, she was Director of Jazz Studies at the University of Connecticut[1][2][7].

As a composer and arranger, Rowe's works have been performed by ensembles like the Village Vanguard Orchestra, BBC Jazz Orchestra, U.S. Navy Commodores, Berlin and NDR Radio Jazz Orchestras, London Symphony, DIVA, and Perth Jazz Orchestra, appearing on recordings such as *Leave It To DIVA* and *I Believe In You* (DIVA). Her big band compositions are published by Sierra Music Publications, Doug Beach Music, Brava Music, and Excelcia Music. An active clinician and conductor, she has led NAfME All-Eastern and All-Northwest Jazz Ensembles, served as composer-in-residence at institutions like Eastman School of Music, and coordinates the JEN Sisters In Jazz Collegiate Combo Competition[1][2].
