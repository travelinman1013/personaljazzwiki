## Biography
Alton Nehemiah Ellis was born on September 1, 1938, in Trenchtown, Kingston, Jamaica, into a musical family that included his older brothers Leslie (who later performed as one of his backup singers and co-wrote songs) and Irving (known as 'Niney'), a popular singer and steel pan player. He learned piano at a young age and attended Ebeneezer and Boys' Town schools, excelling in both music and sport. Ellis began his career as a dancer at age sixteen, performing in talent competitions on Vere Johns' Opportunity Hour. After winning several dance competitions over a two-year period, he transitioned to singing in 1959, forming the duo Alton & Eddy with Eddy Parkins. Their first recording, 'Muriel,' on the Coxsone label became a major hit in Jamaican music history.

As ska evolved in the mid-1960s, Ellis became instrumental in developing rocksteady, earning him the informal title 'Godfather of Rocksteady.' After Eddy Parkins left for America, Ellis formed Alton Ellis and The Flames, achieving massive success on the Treasure Isle label with hits including 'Dance Crasher,' 'Girl I've Got a Date,' and 'Cry Tough.' His 1967 release 'Rock Steady,' backed by Tommy McCook and the Supersonics, was the first song to reference the new genre by name and heralded Jamaican music's new direction. Ellis's records were notably anti-rude boy, including tracks like 'Don't Trouble People' that countered the violent rude boy subculture. After launching his solo career in 1967 with Studio One, he produced an enormous catalog of hits including 'I'm Still in Love,' 'Breaking Up,' and 'I'm Just a Guy.' His debut album 'Mr Soul of Jamaica' with Tommy McCook and the Supersonics is regarded as one of the definitive rocksteady albums.

Ellis left Jamaica in 1969 for a two-year stint in Toronto, Canada, returned home for three years, then relocated permanently to London, England in 1974. His influence on reggae extended far beyond his remarkable catalog—his love of major seventh chords and romantic melodies created the blueprint for lovers' rock, while his soulful, painfully honest voice that was proudly Jamaican with little debt to American R&B or gospel styles became the starting point for hundreds of reggae singers. Unlike nearly every other 1950s artist, he continued his run of hits well into the 1970s and kept writing and recording throughout his life. In 2006, he was inducted into the International Reggae And World Music Awards Hall of Fame. Ellis received the Order of Distinction from the Jamaican government and passed away on October 10, 2008, leaving behind a legacy as one of the most influential voices in Jamaican music history.

## Fun Facts
- Ellis began his entertainment career as a dancer at age sixteen, winning many awards in dance competitions over a two-year period before switching to singing.
- His 1967 song 'Rock Steady' was the first song to actually reference the name of the rocksteady genre, literally naming the musical movement that would define Jamaican music in the late 1960s.
- The bass line from his foundational rocksteady track 'Girl I've Got a Date' was allegedly duplicated in international hits 'The Liquidator' by Harry J Allstars and 'I'll Take You There' by The Staple Singers.
- Unlike nearly every other 1950s artist in Jamaican music, Ellis remarkably continued his run of hits well into the 1970s and kept writing and recording throughout his life, maintaining relevance across multiple decades and musical eras.
