## Biography
Dolly Parton, Linda Ronstadt, and Emmylou Harris formed a celebrated country supergroup in the mid-1980s, culminating in the release of their landmark collaborative album, 'Trio,' in March 1987. Each artist brought a distinct musical background: Parton, rooted in Appalachian country and songwriting; Ronstadt, a versatile vocalist with deep ties to rock, pop, and classic country; and Harris, a folk and country innovator shaped by her time with Gram Parsons. Their individual careers flourished throughout the 1970s, and their mutual admiration led to early collaborative attempts, though conflicting schedules and record label restrictions delayed a full joint project for nearly a decade.[1][2][3][5][6][7]

When 'Trio' finally emerged, it showcased their harmonious blend of voices and reverence for traditional country music. Produced by George Massenburg, the album featured covers and originals, including hits like 'To Know Him Is to Love Him' and 'Wildflowers.' The record was both a commercial and critical triumph, selling over four million copies worldwide, winning two Grammy Awards, and spawning several hit singles. Their collaboration is credited with helping to revive interest in mountain music and Americana, influencing a new generation of artists and listeners.[1][2][3][5][6][7]

The group's legacy extends beyond their initial release. In 1999, the trio reunited for 'Trio II,' further cementing their status as icons of female collaboration in country music. Their work together is widely regarded as a milestone in the genre, demonstrating the power of artistic friendship and the enduring appeal of vocal harmony.[4][6][7]
