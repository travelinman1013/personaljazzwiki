## Biography
Medeski, Martin & Wood (often abbreviated MMW) is an American jazz trio formed in New York City in 1991, bringing together keyboardist John Medeski, drummer/percussionist Billy Martin, and bassist Chris Wood.[2][9] Medeski, a former child prodigy from Kentucky, and Wood, raised in Colorado, first met as students at the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston, where they began playing together in various settings.[1][6] Martin, a New York City native immersed in downtown experimental and world-music scenes, was introduced to them by his mentor, drummer Bob Moses, completing a lineup that quickly found an immediate and organic chemistry at their first jam in Martin’s Brooklyn loft.[1][2][3] The trio’s first official engagement at New York’s Village Gate in 1991 led to regular rehearsals, a growing book of original material, and their self-released debut, *Notes from the Underground* (1992), which showcased an acoustic-rooted but already adventurous approach.[2][3]

Throughout the 1990s, MMW emerged from the New York downtown avant‑garde scene and built a national following through relentless touring and an increasingly groove‑oriented sound that bridged free improvisation with funk, rock, and hip‑hop aesthetics.[2] Early albums such as *It’s a Jungle in Here* (1993) and *Friday Afternoon in the Universe* (1995) on Gramavision blended Thelonious Monk and Bob Marley medleys with original tunes, signaling their refusal to respect stylistic boundaries.[2] Their 1996 album *Shack‑Man*, recorded in a remote practice shack in the Maui jungle, became a breakthrough within the nascent jam‑band community, aided by high‑profile live collaborations with Phish.[2] After fielding interest from 17 labels, they signed to the legendary Blue Note Records in 1998, where albums like *Combustication* (with DJ Logic), *The Dropper*, and *Uninvisible* pushed further into studio experimentation, hip‑hop production ideas, and textural exploration while retaining deep, danceable grooves.[1][2][4]

Musically, MMW is known for straddling the line between avant‑garde improvisation and accessible, rhythm‑driven jazz, often framed as a reimagined organ trio that swaps guitar for adventurous bass and extended percussion.[2] Medeski’s arsenal of Hammond B‑3, electric pianos, and analog keyboards, Wood’s earthy acoustic and electric bass lines, and Martin’s polyrhythmic, global‑influenced drumming create a highly interactive trio language that is at once elastic and tightly grooving.[2][3][7] Over nearly three decades, they have become a key reference point in modern jazz‑fusion and the jam‑band world, credited with helping spark a renaissance in B‑3–based organ trios and making collaborations with DJs and turntablists an accepted part of contemporary jazz practice.[2] Alongside their group work, all three members have pursued prolific side projects—such as Medeski’s work with The Word and John Scofield, Wood’s roots‑oriented duo The Wood Brothers, and Martin’s Amulet Records and percussion projects—further extending the trio’s influence across jazz, rock, jam, and experimental music scenes.[2][3][4][8]

## Fun Facts
- Their breakthrough album *Shack‑Man* was recorded entirely in a rustic shack in the Maui jungle, where the band had been living and rehearsing; the makeshift studio environment became central to the album’s earthy, groove‑heavy sound.[1][2]
- Before settling on the name Medeski, Martin & Wood, the trio briefly considered other band names and even made one round of homemade press kits with an early name before friends persuaded them to use their surnames instead.[3]
- When they were shopping for a new label in the late 1990s, MMW were courted by an extraordinary 17 different record companies before ultimately signing with Blue Note Records in 1998.[1]
- Medeski originally played mostly acoustic piano with the group, but as they began extensive touring he switched to the Hammond B‑3 organ and an array of electric keyboards, both for portability and to better support their evolving, amplified, groove‑oriented sound.[2]
