## Biography
Lorez Alexandria, born Dolorez Alexandria Turner on August 14, 1929, in Chicago, Illinois, emerged as one of the most expressive and underrated jazz vocalists of the twentieth century. She began her musical journey singing gospel in church choirs and spent over a decade with an a cappella group before transitioning to jazz in the vibrant Chicago club scene. Alexandria quickly became a local favorite, performing at venues like the Brass Rail and the Cloister Inn, and recording for independent labels such as King and Argo Records in the 1950s. Her early recordings, including her debut album 'This is Lorez' with the King Fleming Quartet, showcased her rich, emotive voice and sophisticated phrasing, drawing critical comparisons to jazz greats like Dinah Washington, Sarah Vaughan, Carmen McRae, and Ella Fitzgerald.

In the mid-1960s, Alexandria relocated to Los Angeles, seeking broader opportunities and soon became a featured vocalist at prominent clubs such as the Parisian Room and Marla's Memory Lane. Signing with Impulse! Records, she released acclaimed albums like 'Alexandria the Great' and 'More of the Great,' collaborating with top jazz musicians including members of Miles Davis's former rhythm section. Her style was marked by a remarkable ability to convey complex emotions, blending gospel roots with jazz sophistication, and her interpretations of standards and contemporary material alike were noted for their depth and originality. Despite not achieving widespread commercial fame, Alexandria's legacy endures through her influential recordings and the respect she garnered among jazz aficionados and musicians alike.
