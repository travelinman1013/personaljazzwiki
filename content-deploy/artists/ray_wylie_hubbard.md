## Biography
Ray Wylie Hubbard, born November 13, 1946, in Soper, Oklahoma, began his musical journey in his youth.  His family relocated to Dallas in 1954, where he attended W. H. Adamson High School alongside fellow musicians Michael Martin Murphey, Larry Groce, B. W. Stevenson, and Owen Temple.  After graduating in 1965, he enrolled at North Texas State University as an English major, spending summers playing folk music in New Mexico with the trio Three Faces West.  This period proved formative, as it was in New Mexico that he penned "Up Against the Wall, Redneck Mother," a song later popularized by Jerry Jeff Walker.

The success of "Up Against the Wall, Redneck Mother" led to a record deal with Warner Bros. Records in 1976.  Hubbard formed a band, releasing *Ray Wylie Hubbard and the Cowboy Twinkies*, an album whose production he vehemently disliked due to unwanted overdubs and backing vocals added by producer Michael Brovsky.  He continued recording throughout the 1980s for various labels, blending country, folk, and blues, but faced sales challenges.  He founded his own label, Misery Loves Company, releasing *Caught in the Act* (1984).  A resurgence in popularity began in the early 1990s with albums like *Lost Train of Thought* (1992) and *Loco Gringo's Lament* (1994), establishing a steady following that continues to this day.

Hubbard's musical style, while described by him as rock & roll in reference to his 2017 album *Tell the Devil I'm Getting There as Fast as I Can*, is often associated with outlaw country.  His career demonstrates a blend of folk, country, and blues influences, shaped by his early experiences playing folk music and his later struggles with addiction and personal loss.  His enduring popularity and continued recording attest to his lasting impact on the music scene.  He overcame significant personal challenges, including alcoholism and cocaine addiction, finding sobriety in 1987 with the help of Stevie Ray Vaughan.
