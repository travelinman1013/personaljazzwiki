## Biography
Tom Lehrer was born on April 9, 1928, in New York City to a secular Jewish family and grew up on Manhattan's Upper East Side. A prodigy, he began classical piano lessons at age seven but soon gravitated toward popular music, blending both styles into the comedic sensibility that would define his career. Lehrer excelled academically, skipping grades and entering Harvard College at just fifteen, where he earned his BA and MA in mathematics and later taught at several prestigious institutions including MIT, Harvard, and the University of California, Santa Cruz[1][2][6].

Lehrer's musical career began in the early 1950s with self-financed recordings such as 'Songs by Tom Lehrer.' His witty, satirical songs—often lampooning politics, science, and social conventions—quickly gained a cult following. Lehrer performed only 109 shows and wrote 37 songs over two decades, yet his sharp lyricism and dark humor left an indelible mark on musical comedy. Notable works include 'Poisoning Pigeons in the Park,' 'The Elements,' and contributions to the children's TV show 'The Electric Company.' He also served in the U.S. Army at the NSA, experiences that occasionally informed his writing[1][2][3].

After retiring from public performance in the 1970s, Lehrer focused on teaching mathematics and musical theater, notably at UC Santa Cruz. Despite his brief time in the spotlight, Lehrer's legacy endures through his influence on generations of satirists and musicians. He passed away in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on July 26, 2025, at the age of 97[2][3].
