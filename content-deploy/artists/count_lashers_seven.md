## Biography
Count Lasher, born Terence Parkins in 1921 in Saint Thomas, Jamaica, emerged as one of the most influential figures in the development of Jamaican mento music. Growing up in the mountainous parish, Lasher taught himself piano and guitar, and after leaving school, he moved to Kingston where he began performing for tourists on boats in Kingston Harbour. His early exposure to both rural and urban mento styles shaped his versatile approach to music, allowing him to blend traditional Jamaican folk elements with the emerging sounds of calypso, ska, and eventually reggae[1][2].

Lasher's career flourished throughout the 1950s and 1960s, marked by his prolific output and charismatic performances at hotels, beach parties, charity events, and cinemas. His debut recordings were produced by Stanley Motta, and he was frequently accompanied by his ensemble, Count Lasher's Seven, as well as other groups like the Royal Calypsonians and Calypso Quartet. Lasher participated in high-profile music competitions, such as the Federated Calypso Clash at Ward's Theatre in 1957, where he performed alongside Trinidadian calypso legends. Despite releasing over fifty singles, he never recorded a full-length album, which has contributed to his status as an overlooked yet foundational artist in Jamaican music history[1][2][3].

Musically, Count Lasher was celebrated for his storytelling and social commentary, often using colorful local dialect and humor in his lyrics. His songs, such as "Mango Time" and "Breadfruit Season," became anthems of Jamaican culture, reflecting everyday life and traditions. Lasher's innovative blending of mento with calypso and later ska and reggae helped pave the way for future generations of Jamaican musicians, and his legacy endures as one of the genre's greatest vocalists and writers[1][2][4].
