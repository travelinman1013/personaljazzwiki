## Biography
The Jackson 5 were a pioneering American pop and soul group formed in the early 1960s by five brothers from a large working‑class family in **Gary, Indiana**: Jackie (Sigmund), Tito (Toriano), Jermaine, Marlon, and Michael Jackson.[3][4] Raised by their parents Joseph and Katherine Jackson, the boys were initially coached and managed by their father, a former guitarist who recognized their talent after finding them playing his old guitar.[3][4] They honed their act on the local club and talent‑show circuit—part of the Black performance network often called the Chitlin’ Circuit—and recorded early singles for the Gary‑based Steeltown label before winning competitions with covers like the Temptations’ “My Girl” and the amateur night at the Apollo Theater in Harlem in 1967.[2][3][4]

Their Apollo success helped bring them to the attention of Motown‑affiliated stars Gladys Knight and Bobby Taylor, and, with further support from Diana Ross, the group signed to Motown Records in 1969.[1][2][3][4] Marketed as a bright, youthful counterpart to the label’s more mature acts, The Jackson 5 exploded onto the charts with four consecutive U.S. number‑one pop singles—“I Want You Back,” “ABC,” “The Love You Save,” and “I’ll Be There”—an unprecedented feat for a debuting group.[1][2][4] Their exuberant blend of **Motown soul, funk, and bubblegum pop**, combined with tight choreography and colorful fashion, made them a multimedia sensation across records, television, and touring, and established Michael as a prodigy even as Jermaine and Michael pursued parallel solo careers.[2][3][4][5] Frustrated by Motown’s control over their material and low royalty rates, the brothers (except Jermaine) left Motown for Epic Records in 1976, continuing as **The Jacksons** with younger brother Randy added to the lineup, while Motown retained the “Jackson 5” name.[2][3][4]

By the mid‑1970s the group had sold tens of millions of records worldwide, later cited at more than 100 million by the time of their breakup, and helped usher Motown into its second decade with a fresh, youth‑oriented sound.[2][5] Their success paved the way for modern boy bands and family groups, demonstrating the commercial power of Black youth culture in mainstream pop and television.[3][4][5] As The Jackson 5 and later The Jacksons, they influenced generations of R&B, pop, and dance acts with their harmonies, showmanship, and crossover appeal, while Michael Jackson’s subsequent solo career—building on the vocal style, stagecraft, and audience built in the group—reshaped popular music on a global scale.[2][3][4][7]

## Fun Facts
- The brothers performed under several names—including “The Jackson Brothers” and “Ripples & Waves Plus Michael”—before settling on the name “The Jackson 5.”[3]
- Motown’s publicity machine initially promoted the group as having been discovered by Diana Ross, even though Gladys Knight and Bobby Taylor had already championed them to the label.[1][2][3]
- The Jackson 5 were the first group to debut on the Billboard Hot 100 with four consecutive number‑one singles: “I Want You Back,” “ABC,” “The Love You Save,” and “I’ll Be There.”[1][2][4]
- When the brothers left Motown in 1976, the label legally kept the name “Jackson 5,” forcing them to continue at Epic Records under the new name “The Jacksons,” with younger brother Randy joining the lineup.[2][3][4]
