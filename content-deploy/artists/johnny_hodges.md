## Biography
Johnny Hodges, born Cornelius Hodges on July 25, 1907, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, was one of jazz’s most distinctive alto saxophonists, renowned for his lush, expressive tone and mastery of ballads. Raised in a musically inclined family—his mother was a pianist—Hodges was largely self-taught, beginning on piano and drums before moving to the soprano saxophone at age 14. His early musical development was shaped by the vibrant Boston jazz scene, where he was mentored by the legendary Sidney Bechet and influenced local musicians even as a teenager.

In 1924, Hodges moved to New York City, quickly establishing himself by playing with prominent bands led by Lloyd Scott, Chick Webb, Bobby Sawyer, and Luckey Roberts. His career-defining moment came in 1928 when he joined Duke Ellington’s orchestra, becoming its most featured soloist for nearly four decades. Hodges’s velvety, lyrical style became a hallmark of Ellington’s sound, especially on pieces like “Passion Flower,” “Prelude to a Kiss,” and “Jeep’s Blues.” He briefly left Ellington’s band from 1951 to 1955 to lead his own group but returned, remaining with Ellington until his death in New York City on May 11, 1970. Hodges’s influence on jazz saxophone is profound, and his legacy endures in the countless musicians he inspired.

## Fun Facts
- Hodges’s nickname 'Rabbit' reportedly came from his speed in evading truant officers as a child, though some say it was due to his fondness for lettuce and tomato sandwiches.
- Despite his legendary status, Hodges never learned to read music fluently and relied heavily on his ear and improvisational skill.
- He was voted best alto saxophonist by Down Beat magazine readers ten times and won the critics’ poll seven times.
- Ellington once said after Hodges’s death, 'Our band will never sound the same.'
