## Biography
The search results reveal multiple individuals named Alfred or Albert Harris, making a definitive biography challenging. The most prominent figure is Albert Harris (13 February 1916 – 14 February 2005), an English musician and composer who spent most of his career in Hollywood. Born in London, Harris demonstrated early musical talent, studying piano from age 6 and becoming a self-taught guitarist. During the mid-1930s, he established himself as a session musician in London, notably performing as a guitarist with the Lew Stone band, where his improvisations enhanced numerous recordings between 1934-35.

Harris relocated to New York in 1938, where he played piano in big bands across the United States before pursuing formal music education at New York University's College of Music, earning a doctorate in music in 1944. He moved to Los Angeles in 1942 and studied composition with Mary Carr Moore and Eugen Zador, and conducting with Richard Lert. Over 30 years, Harris worked as an orchestrator, arranger, and composer for major film studios and collaborated with prominent artists including Barbra Streisand, Roberta Flack, and Cher. He served as Assistant Musical Director for NBC from 1946 to 1949 and was a professor of orchestration at UCLA.

Harris's later career included founding Music Service Incorporated (MSI) with Nelson Riddle and others, which produced music for television shows including the Dick Van Dyke Show, Mary Tyler Moore, and Andy Griffith Show. He composed and conducted for Quinn Martin Productions, creating scores for television series such as Cannon, Barnaby Jones, and Streets of San Francisco. Harris retired from film and television work in 1990, married Diane Smith from New Zealand in 1986, and relocated to New Zealand in 1992, where he died in Auckland on 14 February 2005.
