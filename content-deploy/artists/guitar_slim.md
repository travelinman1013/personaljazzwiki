## Biography
Eddie Lee 'Guitar Slim' Jones was born on December 10, 1926, in Greenwood, Mississippi, and spent his formative years in the Mississippi Delta, raised by his grandmother after his mother’s death when he was five[1][2][3]. As a child, he worked in cotton fields and later gained local fame as a dancer and singer in juke joints, earning nicknames like 'Limber Leg Eddie' for his energetic moves[1][2][3]. After serving in the U.S. Army during World War II, he returned to the Delta, where he was recruited by bluesmen Willie D. Warren and Little Bill Wallace to perform in Arkansas and Louisiana before settling in New Orleans in the early 1950s[2][3]. There, he adopted the stage name 'Guitar Slim' and developed a reputation for his flamboyant stage presence, wild guitar playing, and gospel-inflected vocals[1][2]. His 1954 hit 'The Things That I Used to Do,' produced by Johnny Vincent at Specialty Records, became a million-seller and one of the biggest rhythm & blues records of the decade[1][2]. Slim’s career, however, was marked by personal struggles, and he died of pneumonia in New York City on February 7, 1959, at age 32[1][2][3].

## Fun Facts
- Guitar Slim was known for his outrageous stage antics, including wearing brightly colored suits and shoes, dyeing his hair to match, and using a 50- to 350-foot guitar cord so he could roam the audience—sometimes even climbing onto his assistant’s shoulders or playing outside the club, stopping traffic[1][2].
- He experimented with distorted guitar tones a full decade before Jimi Hendrix, making him a precursor to rock guitar innovation[1][2].
- Despite his wild image, Slim’s lyrics often reflected deep, philosophical themes about life’s hardships, leading Atco Records to advertise him as a 'philosopher' in 1958[2].
- Slim’s hit 'The Things That I Used to Do' was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame’s '500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll'[1].
