## Biography
The Blind Boys of Alabama are a pioneering American gospel group formed in 1939 by a group of African American students at the Alabama Institute for the Negro Deaf and Blind in Talladega, Alabama.[3][5] Originally known as the **Happy Land Jubilee Singers** (later the Happy Land Gospel Singers), the founding lineup included Clarence Fountain, George Scott, Velma Bozman Traylor, Johnny Fields, Olice/Olive Thomas, and sighted member J.T. Hutton, all descendants of freed slaves who grew up in the Jim Crow South.[1][3][5] They began performing at school, then for soldiers at military installations, and made their professional debut on Birmingham radio in 1944 before leaving school to tour the segregated gospel circuit across the South.[1][3][5] In 1948, after a New Jersey promoter billed a concert as a “Battle of the Blind Boys of Alabama vs. the Blind Boys of Mississippi,” the group adopted the name **The Blind Boys of Alabama**, under which they began recording and touring widely in the 1950s.[2][3][8]

Throughout the mid‑20th century, the Blind Boys became a cornerstone of traditional gospel, known for hard‑driving quartet harmony, call‑and‑response singing, and emotionally charged performances rooted in church tradition.[1][3][4] They recorded for labels such as Specialty Records from 1953, helped define the sound of gospel quartet singing, and were active supporters of the civil rights movement, performing at benefits for Martin Luther King Jr. and other events in the early 1960s.[4][5][8] Though their visibility waned in the 1970s, they experienced a powerful resurgence in the 1980s, especially through their starring role in the Obie Award‑winning stage production **“The Gospel at Colonus,”** which introduced them to secular and international audiences and began a new chapter in their career.[4][5][6] In subsequent decades, the group embraced collaborations across genres while remaining firmly rooted in gospel, earning multiple Grammy Awards (including five competitive Grammys and a Lifetime Achievement Award), induction into the Gospel Music Hall of Fame, and invitations to perform at the White House for several U.S. presidents, solidifying their status as both living legends and modern innovators who carried traditional gospel into the 21st century.[4][5][6] Even as members passed on, figures such as longtime singer Jimmy Carter continued to lead the ensemble, making the Blind Boys of Alabama one of the longest‑lived and most decorated groups in American roots music.[2][4][5]

## Fun Facts
- The group began as the Happy Land Jubilee Singers at a residential school in Talladega, Alabama, and only became the “Blind Boys of Alabama” after a 1948 concert was promoted as a “Battle of the Blind Boys of Alabama vs. the Blind Boys of Mississippi,” a publicity gimmick that permanently changed their name.[2][3]
- Several founders, including Clarence Fountain and George Scott, were still children when they launched the group; they left school in the mid‑1940s to tour the segregated gospel circuit full‑time, performing for pocket change and often facing harsh travel conditions under Jim Crow.[1][3][5]
- The Blind Boys of Alabama eventually won five Grammy Awards plus a Lifetime Achievement Grammy and were inducted into the Gospel Music Hall of Fame, despite having spent more than four decades largely within the traditional gospel world before breaking into wider public awareness in the 1980s.[4][6][8]
- They performed at the White House for three different U.S. presidents, a remarkable trajectory for a group that began singing as blind schoolchildren in the 1930s American South.[4]

## Musical Connections

### Mentors/Influences
- [[golden_gate_quartet|Golden Gate Quartet]] - Stylistic and inspirational model for Clarence Fountain and the early group; their radio broadcasts inspired the boys at the Alabama Institute to form their own gospel quartet and shaped their approach to harmonies and arrangements. (Influence heard across early Happy Land Jubilee Singers/Blind Boys of Alabama recordings and arrangements in the 1940s–1950s rather than on a single credited project.) [Late 1930s–1940s (formative years at the Alabama Institute)]

### Key Collaborators
- [[clarence_fountain|Clarence Fountain]] - Founding member, primary lead singer, arranger, and visionary of the group for decades; central to their classic mid‑century quartet sound and later revival. (Early recordings as the Happy Land/Blind Boys of Alabama (1950s gospel sides), numerous albums through the 20th century, and performances including The Gospel at Colonus.) [1939–2000s[1][3][4][6]]
- [[george_scott|George Scott]] - Founding member and key vocalist who helped establish the group at the Alabama Institute and later invited Jimmy Carter back into the group during their revival period. (Early touring and recordings from the 1940s–1950s; later work including the 1980s revival and The Gospel at Colonus.) [1939–1980s[2][3][4]]
- [[jimmy_carter|Jimmy Carter]] - Longtime singer who joined as a boy at the Alabama Institute and later became the group’s leader, fronting the ensemble through its late‑20th‑ and early‑21st‑century prominence. (Key vocalist on late‑20th‑century and 21st‑century albums and tours, including their Grammy‑winning projects and Echoes of the South.) [Initially early 1940s; core member and leader from 1982 onward[2][4][5]]
- [[the_gospel_at_colonus_theatrical_production_and_ensemble_cast_including_morgan_freeman|The Gospel at Colonus (theatrical production and ensemble cast, including Morgan Freeman)]] - The Blind Boys collaborated with a large theatrical cast and creative team in this Obie Award‑winning adaptation of Sophocles’ Oedipus at Colonus, using their gospel singing as a dramatic engine of the show. (The Gospel at Colonus (Off‑Broadway and Broadway production, also broadcast on PBS Great Performances).) [Early–mid 1980s[4][6]]

### Artists Influenced
- [[contemporary_roots_and_gospel_crossover_artists_various|Contemporary roots and gospel crossover artists (various)]] - The group’s longevity, innovative approach to traditional gospel, and broad crossover collaborations have made them a model for artists blending sacred themes with modern roots, Americana, and popular music; they are frequently cited as defining 20th‑century gospel traditions and creating a new gospel sound for the 21st century. (Their body of work, from 1950s quartet recordings through late‑career albums and their Grammy‑winning projects, has served as a template for later gospel and roots recordings.) [Late 20th century–present[4][5][6]]
