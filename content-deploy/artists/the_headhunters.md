## Biography
The Headhunters are a pioneering American **jazz‑funk and jazz‑fusion** band formed in 1973 by pianist and composer **Herbie Hancock** as he shifted away from his earlier, more experimental Mwandishi ensemble toward a more groove‑oriented sound.[1][4][6] The original lineup featured Hancock on keyboards with **Bennie Maupin** (saxophones and reeds), **Paul Jackson** (bass), **Harvey Mason** (drums, soon replaced by **Mike Clark**), and **Bill Summers** (percussion), fusing jazz harmony and improvisation with the rhythms and textures of funk, rock, and R&B.[1][3][4] Their debut album *Head Hunters* (1973) became one of the best‑selling jazz records ever, achieving platinum status, crossing over to rock and R&B audiences, and marking a major turning point in Hancock’s career and in 1970s electric jazz.[1][3][4][6]

Throughout the mid‑1970s, The Headhunters served as Hancock’s core band on a string of influential Columbia albums, including *Thrust* (1974), *Man‑Child* (1975), *Secrets* (1976), and *Sunlight* (1977), while also developing an identity as an autonomous group.[3][5] Encouraged by Hancock, they released *Survival of the Fittest* (1975), produced by him, and *Straight from the Gate* (1977/78), which featured him as a guest.[3][5][6] After Hancock’s departure around 1980, the band’s members pursued other projects, but The Headhunters periodically reunited: notably for *Return of the Headhunters* (1998, with Hancock), and later albums such as *Evolution Revolution* (2003), *Platinum* (2011), and *Speakers in the House* (2022), before continuing with live projects and new studio work.[4][5][6][8]

Musically, The Headhunters are defined by **deep funk grooves**, syncopated bass lines, polyrhythmic percussion, and concise, hook‑oriented melodies, combining the improvisational sophistication of post‑bop with the danceability of R&B and funk.[3][4][6] Their track “God Make Me Funky,” originally from *Survival of the Fittest*, became a canonical breakbeat, sampled hundreds of times by hip‑hop and pop producers in the 1980s and 1990s, while the *Head Hunters* classics “Chameleon” and “Watermelon Man” became standards of the jazz‑funk repertoire.[2][4][6][7] Led today by original members **Bill Summers** and **Mike Clark**, joined by New Orleans–based musicians such as **Donald Harrison**, **Kyle Roussel**, and **Chris Severin**, The Headhunters’ legacy stretches over five decades, widely credited with redefining modern funk, world music–inflected jazz, and the possibilities of popular‑leaning fusion.[2][4][7][8]

## Fun Facts
- The band’s name “Headhunters” was chosen by Herbie Hancock during a session of Buddhist chanting; he liked that it simultaneously suggested the jungle, intellectual pursuits, and sexuality.[1]
- Their debut album Head Hunters became jazz’s first or one of its first platinum‑selling albums, at one point reportedly outselling Miles Davis’s Bitches Brew and reaching rock and R&B audiences well beyond typical jazz listeners.[1][4][6]
- The track “God Make Me Funky” from Survival of the Fittest is often cited as one of the most sampled fusion tunes ever, with more than 350 documented samples across hip‑hop and pop.[4][6][7]
- In recent years The Headhunters have been co‑led by original members Bill Summers and Mike Clark and augmented by prominent New Orleans musicians, underscoring the group’s ongoing evolution rather than functioning solely as a nostalgia act.[2][4][7][8]

### Mentors/Influences
