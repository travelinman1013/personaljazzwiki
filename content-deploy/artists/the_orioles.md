## Biography
The Orioles were an American R&B vocal group formed in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1947, initially as the Vibra-Naires, and are widely recognized as one of the first vocal groups in R&B and pioneers of the doo-wop sound. Led by tenor Sonny Til (born Earlington Tilghman on August 18, 1928), the original lineup included Alexander Sharp (first tenor), George Nelson (baritone), Johnny Reed (bass), and guitarist Tommy Gaither. After meeting aspiring songwriter and manager Deborah Chessler, they appeared on Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts in 1948, securing a deal with It's a Natural Records (a Jubilee subsidiary). They changed their name to The Orioles, honoring Maryland's state bird, and scored their breakthrough hit 'It's Too Soon to Know,' which topped the R&B charts.[1][2][3]

Their musical style featured heartfelt lead vocals by Sonny Til on slow romantic ballads, supported by soft, wordless melismatic harmonies from the group, minimal instrumentation like guitar and bass, and a rhythmic approach evolving from Ink Spots-style pop. Hits like 'Tell Me So' (1949, #1 R&B), 'Forgive and Forget,' 'Crying in the Chapel' (1953), and 'In the Mission of St. Augustine' (1953) followed, drawing screaming fans especially for Til. Despite lineup changes after Gaither's death in 1950 and declining hits by 1954, Til reformed the group multiple times into the 1970s, recording for labels like Vee-Jay and performing with groups like the Ink Spots.[1][3][4]

The Orioles' legacy as 'founding fathers of R&B vocal groups' alongside The Ravens influenced doo-wop and rock and roll, establishing the pattern of tenor-led harmonies. Inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995 and the Vocal Group Hall of Fame, their shift from big bands to small vocal ensembles marked a pivotal change in popular music.[2][3][4]
