## Biography
Black Heat was a dynamic funk band that emerged in the early 1970s, founded by percussionist King Raymond Green and discovered by jazz trumpeter Phillip Guilbeau. The group quickly made a name for themselves with their energetic blend of funk, jazz, and breakbeat influences, signing to Atlantic Records and releasing three albums: 'Black Heat' (1972), 'No Time to Burn' (1974), and 'Keep On Runnin'' (1975). Their single 'No Time to Burn' became a moderate hit, reaching the top 50 on the Billboard R&B chart, and showcased their signature style marked by tight grooves, powerful horn sections, and infectious rhythms.[2][5]

The band's lineup included Johnell Gray (keyboards, vocals), Bradley Owens (guitar, vocals), Chip Jones (bass, vocals), King Raymond Green (congas, timbales, harmonica, vocals), Esco Cromer (drums, vocals), Ray Thompson (woodwind), and Rodney Edwards (trumpet). Black Heat's music was characterized by its raw funk energy, jazz-inflected improvisation, and danceable beats, aligning them with the broader 1970s funk movement and the emerging go-go scene in Washington, D.C. Their work, especially the album 'No Time to Burn,' is considered essential listening for funk enthusiasts and has been celebrated for its influence on later breakbeat and hip-hop sampling.[2][5]

Although Black Heat disbanded after their third album, their legacy endured through reissues and continued appreciation among collectors and DJs. In 2001, their first two albums were reissued as 'Declassified Grooves,' and the band reunited for a memorial concert honoring their original producer, Joel Dorn. Their music remains a touchstone for fans of 1970s funk and is recognized for its contribution to the development of the go-go and jazz-funk genres.[2]
