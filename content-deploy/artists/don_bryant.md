## Biography
Don Bryant, born April 4, 1942 in Memphis, Tennessee, emerged from a deeply musical family and a gospel-rich environment. His father, Edward Bryant, led the Four Stars of Harmony, and Don began singing in church at age five, later joining his father’s group before forming his own high school gospel quartet, the Four Kings, which successfully crossed over into secular R&B. Bryant’s early talent was recognized by bandleader Willie Mitchell, who brought him on as a lead singer and, crucially, as a songwriter for Hi Records. By age 18, Bryant was penning songs for Memphis’s top soul artists, quickly establishing himself as a prolific writer and performer.

Bryant’s career flourished through the 1960s and 1970s, both as a solo artist and as a staff songwriter. He released his own singles and the 1969 album 'Precious Soul,' but his greatest impact came behind the scenes, writing or co-writing over 150 songs for Hi Records. His most celebrated collaboration was with Ann Peebles, for whom he co-wrote the iconic 1973 hit 'I Can’t Stand the Rain.' The pair married in 1974, and Bryant continued to write and perform, primarily in gospel, for decades. After a long hiatus from solo recording, Bryant returned to the spotlight with the critically acclaimed albums 'Don’t Give Up on Love' (2017) and 'You Make Me Feel' (2020), earning overdue recognition as a masterful Memphis soul singer and songwriter.

Bryant’s musical style is rooted in gospel, classic soul, and blues, characterized by emotive vocals and heartfelt lyricism. His legacy is defined by his contributions to the Memphis soul sound, his enduring songwriting, and his influence on subsequent generations of soul and blues musicians.
