## Biography
Arthel Lane "Doc" Watson was born on March 3, 1923, near Deep Gap, North Carolina, and lost his eyesight as an infant due to an untreated eye infection. Raised in a musical family, Watson was exposed early to Appalachian ballads and shape-note hymns, and he taught himself guitar while attending the Morehead School for the Blind in Raleigh. His early performances on street corners and local radio earned him the nickname "Doc," and by the early 1950s, he was playing professionally as a lead guitarist in country and western swing bands, notably with Jack Williams and the Country Gentlemen[1][4].

Watson's career took off in the 1960s after meeting folklorist Ralph Rinzler, who encouraged him to pursue solo work and helped place him at the heart of the American Folk Music Revival. His virtuosic flatpicking guitar style, blending bluegrass, folk, country blues, and old-time music, became his signature and influenced generations of musicians. Watson recorded his first solo album with Vanguard Records in 1964 and went on to release over sixty records, winning eight Grammy Awards over a fifty-year career[1][2][5].

Doc Watson performed extensively with his son Merle Watson from the mid-1960s until Merle's tragic death in 1985. He continued to tour and record, collaborating with a wide range of artists and founding MerleFest in 1988 to honor his son and promote traditional music. Watson's legacy lies in his preservation and modernization of Appalachian music, his technical mastery, and his profound influence on American roots music. He died on May 29, 2012, at age 89[1][3][4].
