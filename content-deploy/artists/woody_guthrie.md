## Biography
Woody Guthrie, born Woodrow Wilson Guthrie on July 14, 1912, in Okemah, Oklahoma, was a pioneering American folk singer, songwriter, and activist whose music chronicled the struggles of ordinary people during the Great Depression and Dust Bowl era. Raised in a musically inclined family, Guthrie learned traditional folk, Western, and Indian songs from his parents, which shaped his early musical style. After experiencing personal tragedy and economic hardship, he became a traveling musician, hitchhiking and riding freight trains across the United States, singing for migrant workers and laborers. His experiences in the Dust Bowl and California migrant camps inspired many of his most famous songs, including 'So Long (It’s Been Good to Know Yuh)' and 'Dust Bowl Ballads,' which captured the hardships and resilience of the era.

Guthrie’s career flourished in the 1940s, particularly after moving to New York City, where he became a central figure in the folk revival movement. He collaborated with prominent artists and activists, including Pete Seeger and the Almanac Singers, and wrote his most iconic song, 'This Land Is Your Land,' as a response to the idealized patriotism of 'God Bless America.' Guthrie’s music blended storytelling with social commentary, addressing themes of labor rights, poverty, and social justice. His legacy endures as a foundational influence on American folk music and protest songwriting, inspiring generations of musicians and activists.
