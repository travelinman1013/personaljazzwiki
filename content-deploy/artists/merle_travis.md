## Biography
Merle Robert Travis (November 29, 1917 – October 20, 1983) was born in Rosewood, Muhlenberg County, Kentucky, in the heart of American coal country. The son of a farmer-turned-coal miner, Travis grew up in poverty but developed an early passion for music, initially learning the five-string banjo before his older brother gave him a homemade guitar at age twelve. His childhood experiences in the coal mining region profoundly shaped his songwriting, inspiring classics like "Sixteen Tons" and "Dark as a Dungeon" that chronicled the lives and economic struggles of Kentucky coal miners. Travis absorbed the distinctive fingerpicking guitar style unique to Muhlenberg County by following local musicians Ike Everly and Mose Rager to parties and dances, eventually mastering a complex technique that combined blues, ragtime, and popular music elements.

Travis launched his professional career in 1937 when fiddler Clayton McMichen hired him as guitarist for his Georgia Wildcats, followed by a six-year association with the Drifting Pioneers, a gospel quartet that broadcast over Cincinnati's powerful WLW radio station. After a brief stint in the Marines, he relocated to Los Angeles in 1944 and signed with Capitol Records in 1946, achieving immediate success with hits like "Cincinnati Lou," "No Vacancy," and "Divorce Me C.O.D." Throughout the late 1940s and early 1950s, Travis dominated the charts with seven Top Ten songs while also writing major hits for other artists, including "Smoke! Smoke! Smoke! (That Cigarette)." Beyond his recording career, Travis performed in stage shows and appeared in several B-Western films, establishing himself as a multi-talented entertainer.

Travis became widely recognized as America's greatest thumb-style guitarist, developing what became known as "Travis picking"—a distinctive fingerpicking technique that combined thumb-and-finger methods reminiscent of stride piano. His influence extended across generations of musicians, from Chet Atkins to his son Thom Bresh and contemporary hitmakers like Marty Stuart. Inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame, Travis's legacy as a pioneering guitarist and songwriter who elevated country music through both technical innovation and socially conscious songwriting remains unmatched in American music history.
