## Biography
Lee Dorsey was born Irving Lee Dorsey on December 24, 1924 (some sources cite 1926) in the Ninth Ward of New Orleans, Louisiana, a city renowned for its vibrant musical heritage. As a child, he was friends with Fats Domino, another future icon of New Orleans music. At age ten, his family relocated to Portland, Oregon, where Dorsey developed an affinity for country music. After serving as a gunner in the US Navy during World War II, he briefly pursued a career as a professional lightweight boxer under the name 'Kid Chocolate' before returning to New Orleans in the mid-1950s to work as an auto mechanic and begin singing in local clubs.

Dorsey's musical breakthrough came in 1961 with the hit single 'Ya Ya,' which topped the R&B charts and reached the pop Top 10. His career flourished throughout the 1960s, largely through his close collaboration with songwriter, producer, and arranger Allen Toussaint. Together, they crafted a string of memorable R&B and soul hits, including 'Working in the Coal Mine,' 'Ride Your Pony,' and 'Everything I Do Gohn Be Funky (From Now On).' Dorsey's warm, engaging vocals and Toussaint's inventive arrangements bridged the gap between 1950s New Orleans R&B and the emerging funk sound, often with backing from The Meters. Although his commercial success waned by the 1970s, Dorsey remained a beloved figure, especially for his 1970 album 'Yes We Can,' which is now regarded as a classic of progressive soul.

Dorsey's influence extended well beyond his own recordings, inspiring artists across genres and generations. He continued to perform in New Orleans and abroad, maintaining a devoted following until his death on December 1, 1986. His legacy endures in the enduring appeal of his hits and the ongoing reverence of musicians who cite him as a foundational figure in soul and funk.
