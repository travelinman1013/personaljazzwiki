## Biography
Seva Venet is a versatile guitarist and banjoist renowned for his deep commitment to traditional New Orleans jazz. Born and raised in Los Angeles, Venet’s early musical education included piano, trumpet, and trombone before he gravitated towards guitar in his teens. His formative years were shaped by studies with Bill Harkleroad (Zoot Horn Rollo), who introduced him to jazz improvisation and the works of Django Reinhardt and other jazz guitar luminaries. Further mentorship from Ted Greene expanded his harmonic understanding, while his uncle, legendary producer Nik Venet, influenced his approach to songwriting and professionalism. Seva’s father, Steve Venet, also a songwriter and producer, provided a model for artistic diligence and creativity.[1]

Throughout the 1990s, Venet worked as a professional musician and music educator in Los Angeles, performing in a wide array of genres including traditional jazz, blues, Cajun, zydeco, country, and rock. In 1999, driven by a passion for American roots music, he relocated to New Orleans, immersing himself in the city’s rich jazz heritage. There, he studied and performed with Tuba Fats and his Chosen Few band, playing extensively in Jackson Square and at iconic venues like Donna’s Brass Band Headquarters. Venet has since become a fixture in the New Orleans music scene, leading the Storyville String Band—a group modeled after the historic 6 & 7/8 String Band—and collaborating with many of the city’s jazz greats. He is also a prolific educator, having taught hundreds of students and led workshops at institutions such as the New Orleans Center for Creative Arts and the University of New Orleans.[1][2][4]

Venet’s musical style is rooted in the collective improvisation and rhythmic vitality of early New Orleans jazz, but his repertoire spans blues, ragtime, American songbook standards, folk, and even Hawaiian-influenced pieces. He is recognized for his research into the 19th-century roots of jazz and has contributed articles to publications like Offbeat magazine. Venet’s legacy lies in both his performances and his dedication to preserving and transmitting the traditions of New Orleans jazz to new generations of musicians and audiences.[2][3][5]
