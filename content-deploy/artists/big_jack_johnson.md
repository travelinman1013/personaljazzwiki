## Biography
Big Jack Johnson, born Jack N. Johnson on July 30, 1940, in Lambert, Mississippi, was a towering figure in the electric and Delta blues scene. Growing up in a large family of 18 children, Johnson was immersed in music from an early age, inspired by his father Ellis Johnson, a working musician who played fiddle, banjo, and guitar in blues and country styles. Johnson began playing guitar at age 13 and quickly mastered the Delta blues tradition, later expanding his skills to include the mandolin and fiddle. His early musical experiences were rooted in local juke joints and family gatherings, where he absorbed the raw, uncut sound that would define his career.

Johnson rose to prominence in the 1960s as a founding member of the Jelly Roll Kings, alongside Frank Frost and Sam Carr. The group became known for their electrified Delta blues sound, releasing influential albums such as 'Rockin’ the Juke Joint Down' (1979) and 'Off Yonder’s Wall' (1997). After the Jelly Roll Kings disbanded in 1987, Johnson launched a successful solo career, recording acclaimed albums like 'The Oil Man' and 'The Barbecue Sessions,' the latter winning a W.C. Handy Award for Best Acoustic Blues Album in 2003. He was celebrated for his gritty guitar work, soulful vocals, and ability to bridge traditional Delta blues with modern electric styles. Johnson remained a prolific performer and recording artist, touring internationally and earning accolades such as the Living Blues Award for Best Live Performer and Most Outstanding Blues Musician.

Big Jack Johnson’s legacy is marked by his deep connection to the Mississippi blues tradition, his innovative guitar playing, and his role as a mentor to younger musicians. He passed away on March 14, 2011, in Memphis, Tennessee, leaving behind a rich catalog of recordings and a lasting influence on the blues world.
