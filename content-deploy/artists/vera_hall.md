## Biography
Vera Hall, born Adell Hall Ward on April 6, 1902, in Payneville near Livingston, Alabama, emerged as one of the most celebrated voices in American folk and country blues. Raised in a musical family, Hall learned traditional spirituals and work songs from her parents, Efron 'Zully' Hall and Agnes, who instilled in her the rich oral traditions of the Black Belt region. Despite working most of her life as a washerwoman, nursemaid, and cook, Hall's remarkable vocal talent and deep repertoire of spirituals, blues, and folk songs set her apart in the annals of American music.[2][3][6]

Hall's national recognition began in the late 1930s when folklorist Ruby Pickens Tartt introduced her to ethnomusicologist John Avery Lomax, who recorded her for the Library of Congress. Lomax praised her as having 'the loveliest voice I have ever recorded.' Hall's haunting rendition of 'Another Man Done Gone' was broadcast by the BBC in 1943 and played by the Library of Congress to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation. In 1948, Alan Lomax brought Hall to New York City for the American Music Festival at Columbia University, marking her only trip outside Alabama. Her performances and interviews with Lomax became the foundation for his 1959 book 'The Rainbow Sign.'[1][2][3][6]

Vera Hall's legacy endures through her recordings, which capture a unique blend of blues, spirituals, and folk traditions. Her voice, described as a 'liquid, full contralto, rich in low overtones,' continues to inspire musicians and scholars alike. Hall's work was introduced to new generations when Moby sampled her song 'Troubled So Hard' on his 1999 album 'Play.' She was posthumously inducted into the Alabama Women's Hall of Fame in 2005, and her influence remains a defining element of Southern Black culture and American roots music.[1][3][6][7]
