## Biography
Roomful of Blues is a renowned American jump blues and swing revival band that originated in Westerly, Rhode Island, in 1967. Founded by guitarist Duke Robillard and pianist Al Copley, the group began as a four-piece ensemble focused on Chicago blues but soon expanded both its lineup and musical horizons. By 1970, the addition of a horn section, including saxophonists Rich Lataille and Doug James, marked their shift toward the swinging, horn-driven blues and R&B of the 1940s and 1950s. Their energetic live performances quickly earned them a devoted following throughout New England, with a notable 15-year residency at the Knickerbocker Cafe cementing their reputation as a premier live act.[1][2]

The band's national breakthrough came in the late 1970s, aided by the mentorship of songwriter Doc Pomus, who helped secure their first record deal and co-produced their acclaimed self-titled debut album in 1977. Over the decades, Roomful of Blues became known for their precise musicianship and genre-blending style, incorporating elements of boogie-woogie, blues rock, and modern blues. Despite frequent lineup changes—over 60 musicians have been part of the band, including notable members like Ronnie Earl, Lou Ann Barton, and Sugar Ray Norcia—the group has maintained a consistent sound rooted in big band swing and blues tradition. Their discography includes Grammy-nominated albums such as 'Turn It On! Turn It Up!' and collaborations with artists across the blues and rock spectrum.[2][4][3]

Roomful of Blues' legacy lies in their role as torchbearers of classic American blues and swing, revitalizing these genres for new generations. Their influence extends beyond their own recordings and performances, as they have inspired countless musicians and contributed to the broader blues revival movement in the United States. The band's longevity and adaptability have made them a fixture in the blues community for over five decades.[2][1]
