## Biography
Dave Pike was born on March 23, 1938, in Detroit, Michigan, and moved to Los Angeles with his family at a young age. He began playing drums at the age of eight and later taught himself to play the vibraphone, inspired by the work of jazz legends Milt Jackson and Lionel Hampton. By his late teens, Pike was performing professionally in Los Angeles, working with prominent West Coast jazz musicians such as Curtis Counce, Harold Land, Elmo Hope, and Dexter Gordon. In 1960, he moved to New York City, where he became known for pioneering the use of amplification with the vibraphone, a technique that helped shape his distinctive sound. His five-year tenure with flautist Herbie Mann in the 1960s brought him international recognition, as he toured and recorded extensively, particularly in the bossa nova and global jazz genres.

Pike's career spanned several decades and continents. After his time with Herbie Mann, he formed the Dave Pike Set, which gained popularity in Europe, especially in Germany and Belgium. He returned to the United States in the 1970s and revitalized the Orange County jazz scene by transforming Hungry Joe's, a small Huntington Beach club, into a vibrant jazz venue. Pike continued to record and perform, collaborating with artists such as Chick Corea, Hubert Laws, Charlie Haden, and Ornette Coleman. His music blended hard bop, avant-garde, and global jazz influences, and he was celebrated for his improvisational energy and innovative approach to the vibraphone. Pike remained active until his health declined in 2010, and he passed away on October 3, 2015, in Del Mar, California, leaving behind a legacy as a pioneering and versatile jazz vibraphonist.
