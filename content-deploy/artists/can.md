## Biography
Death was an American death metal band formed in Altamonte Springs, Florida, in 1983 by guitarist Chuck Schuldiner, initially under the name Mantas with drummer/vocalist Kam Lee and guitarist Rick Rozz. At age 16, Schuldiner, using the moniker 'Evil Chuck,' began writing and recording demos that circulated through the tape trading network, establishing an early death metal sound inspired by thrash and extreme metal acts like Nasty Savage and Possessed. The band renamed to Death by late 1984, releasing demos like *Reign of Terror* and *Death by Metal*, leading to their landmark 1987 debut album *Scream Bloody Gore* on Combat Records, widely regarded as one of the first true death metal records for its guttural vocals, intensified thrash riffs, and themes of gore and violence.[1][2][6]

Death's lineup remained unstable, with Schuldiner as the constant force driving evolution from raw aggression to technical complexity. After *Scream Bloody Gore*, featuring drummer Chris Reifert, the band recorded 1988's *Leprosy* with Rozz, bassist Terry Butler, and drummer Bill Andrews, gaining notice beyond the underground. Subsequent albums like *Spiritual Healing* (1989, with James Murphy on guitar), *Human* (1991), *Individual Thought Patterns* (1993), and *Symbolic* (1995) incorporated progressive elements, intricate guitar work, and cleaner production at Morrisound Recording. Tensions led to frequent changes, including legal disputes, but Schuldiner's vision propelled Death as pioneers of the Florida death metal scene.[1][2]

In their later years, Death released *The Sound of Perseverance* (1998), blending death metal with progressive influences, before Schuldiner paused the band for his progressive project Control Denied. The band disbanded following Schuldiner's death from glioma and pneumonia on December 13, 2001, at age 34. Death's legacy endures as linchpins of death metal, influencing the genre's shift from primitive extremity to technical sophistication, though they never achieved mainstream success.[1][2][3]

## Fun Facts
- Death originated as Mantas in 1983, named after a Slayer song, before rebranding due to another band using the name.
- Chuck Schuldiner briefly joined Canadian thrash band Slaughter in 1986 but quit after two weeks, calling it a mistake, to focus on Death.
- In 1990, bassist Terry Butler and drummer Bill Andrews toured Europe without Schuldiner, prompting him to take legal action against them.
- Death's debut *Scream Bloody Gore* was largely a one-man effort by Schuldiner, who played guitar, bass, and vocals, with only drums by Chris Reifert.
