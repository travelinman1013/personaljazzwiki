## Biography
Yellowjackets is an American jazz fusion band formed in 1977 in Los Angeles, California, originally as the backing group for guitarist Robben Ford’s solo album 'The Inside Story.' The initial lineup—keyboardist Russell Ferrante, bassist Jimmy Haslip, and drummer Ricky Lawson—found a unique musical chemistry, prompting them to continue as a group after Ford’s departure. Producer Tommy LiPuma signed them to Warner Bros. Records and selected the name 'Yellowjackets' from a list the band had compiled.

The band’s early years were marked by critical acclaim, with their self-titled debut album making a significant impact on jazz radio. Their second album, 'Mirage à Trois,' was nominated for a Grammy, and subsequent releases like 'Shades' and 'Four Corners' achieved commercial success and further Grammy recognition. Over the decades, Yellowjackets have continually evolved, incorporating new members such as saxophonists Marc Russo and Bob Mintzer, and drummers like Will Kennedy. Their sound blends jazz fusion, smooth jazz, jazz funk, and elements of world music, characterized by sophisticated arrangements and improvisational interplay.

With over 25 albums, 17 Grammy nominations, and 2 wins, Yellowjackets have become one of the most influential and enduring groups in contemporary jazz. Their legacy is defined by their innovative approach to jazz fusion, their adaptability to new musical directions, and their role in shaping the sound of modern jazz ensembles.
