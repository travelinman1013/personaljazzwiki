## Biography
SML is a contemporary jazz quintet formed in Los Angeles, California, comprising five highly regarded musicians from the city’s vibrant jazz, improvised, and indie music scenes. The group consists of bassist Anna Butterss, synthesist Jeremiah Chiu, saxophonist Josh Johnson, percussionist Booker Stardrum, and guitarist Gregory Uhlmann. Each member brings a wealth of experience from collaborations with leading artists such as Jason Isbell, Phoebe Bridgers, Meshell Ndegeocello, and Perfume Genius, among others. SML debuted with their album 'Small Medium Large' in June 2024, quickly earning recognition for their innovative approach to ensemble improvisation and production, including a #15 debut on Billboard's Contemporary Jazz Chart.

The band’s creative process is rooted in spontaneous improvisation, with performances often beginning without predetermined direction. This approach fosters a deep sense of trust and musical intuition among the members, resulting in dynamic and unpredictable live sets. SML’s studio work is equally collaborative, with all five musicians contributing to composition, production, and editing. Their sound draws comparisons to artists like Herbie Hancock and Essential Logic, blending elements of jazz, electronic, and experimental music into a cohesive, forward-thinking style.

SML’s legacy is rapidly growing within the Los Angeles music community, where they are seen as central figures in a new wave of jazz and improvised music. Their influence extends through overlapping projects, including Jeff Parker’s ETA IVtet and Expansion Trio, as well as solo and ensemble ventures by each member. With their second album 'How You Been' released in November 2025, SML continues to push boundaries and inspire a new generation of musicians.
