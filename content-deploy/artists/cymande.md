## Biography
Cymande is a pioneering British funk group formed in the early 1970s in South London by a collective of Black musicians who had emigrated from the Caribbean as children. The band was founded by bassist Steve Scipio and guitarist Patrick Patterson, both of whom grew up in Balham, South London, after moving from Guyana. Drawing on their Caribbean heritage and the vibrant multicultural environment of London, Cymande developed a unique sound that fused jazz, funk, soul, reggae, calypso, and African rhythms, resulting in a style that was both deeply political and spiritual.

Cymande's debut album, 'Cymande' (1972), along with 'Second Time Round' (1973) and 'Promised Heights' (1974), showcased their innovative blend of genres and quickly found an audience in the United States, where they became the first British band to perform at the Apollo Theater in New York and toured with soul legend Al Green. Despite this success abroad, the band faced indifference and prejudice from the UK music industry, leading to their initial split in 1975. Over time, however, their music gained cult status, especially among hip-hop, house, and rare groove communities, with tracks like 'Bra' and 'The Message' being widely sampled by artists such as De La Soul, Fugees, and Wu-Tang Clan. Cymande eventually reunited decades later, enjoying renewed acclaim and recognition for their foundational role in Black British music and their lasting influence across genres.
