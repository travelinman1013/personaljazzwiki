## Biography
Terry Timmons was an R&B vocalist from Cleveland, Ohio, born on April 12, 1927, with the personal name Teresa Walker.[2] She emerged as one of the notable vocalists of the late 1940s and early 1950s, a period when her musical work helped bridge genres and styles alongside her musical role model, Dinah Washington.[4][5] Timmons' recording career spanned from the early 1950s through the mid-1950s, during which she recorded boogie-woogie and northern soul influenced material that reflected the evolving sound of post-war American R&B.[3] Her career trajectory was notably affected by personal circumstances, as her recording career reportedly ended in the mid-1950s when her then-current boyfriend, who considered himself a talented musician, influenced her departure from the music industry.[3] Terry Timmons passed away on August 3, 1970, leaving behind a modest but historically significant body of work that documented the R&B vocal traditions of her era.[2]
