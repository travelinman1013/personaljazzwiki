## Biography
Quad City DJ's is an American Miami bass and party-rap group co-founded by producer-DJs C.C. Lemonhead (Nathaniel Orange) and Jay Ski (Johnny McGowan), who emerged from Jacksonville, Florida’s late‑1980s bass scene.[2][5] The pair first worked together in Jacksonville around 1988 in the group Chill Deal, producing local acts such as Three Grand and Icey J, whose answer record “It Takes a Real Man” responded to Rob Base & DJ EZ Rock’s “It Takes Two.”[2] After Chill Deal dissolved, they re‑formed as 95 South and helped drive the early‑’90s southern bass explosion with the triple‑platinum chant‑rap hit “Whoot, There It Is,” before going on to create and produce more club staples including Dis‑n‑Dat’s “Freak Me Baby” and 69 Boyz’ double‑platinum single “Tootsee Roll.”[2][3]

In 1996, Ski and Lemonhead recruited vocalist JeLanna “Lana” LaFleur and officially launched Quad City DJ’s, with “Quad” referencing local slang for powerful bass.[2] Their debut single “C’mon N’ Ride It (The Train),” a rap re‑imagining of Barry White’s 1974 “Theme from Together Brothers,” became their signature hit, reaching No. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100 and earning platinum certification.[2] That momentum carried into their debut album *Get On Up and Dance* (1996), which peaked at No. 31 on the Billboard 200, went platinum, and yielded the follow‑up single “Summer Jam.”[2] Later that year, the group wrote and performed the high‑energy title track for the film *Space Jam*, a song that charted on the Hot 100 and would later become an enduring meme and nostalgia touchstone.[2][3]

Although C.C. Lemonhead stepped back from the spotlight after the breakthrough single and the act was largely marketed as a duo, the Quad City DJ’s sound—built on booming 808 bass, party chants, and catchy, repetitive hooks—remained central to 1990s Southern club music and Miami bass culture.[2] In the 2010s, renewed online interest in the *Space Jam* theme and ’90s nostalgia led the group to perform live again, with a lineup centered on C.C. Lemonhead and newer members such as vocalist Tamara Wallace (formerly of Funky Green Dogs), rapper Tony WHOA! (Anthony Wallace II), and singer/percussionist David D.[2][3] They have released later singles like “4 Minute TwerkOut” (2015) and “What Happens Here Stays Here” (2017), and have continued to tour and record, underscoring their legacy as multi‑platinum, Grammy‑nominated architects of a still‑influential party‑rap sound.[2][3]

## Fun Facts
- The word “Quad” in Quad City DJ’s is a local reference to powerful bass, underscoring their identity as a deep‑bass Miami/Florida club act rather than a nod to a geographic region.[2]
- Their breakout single “C’mon N’ Ride It (The Train)” is built directly on Barry White’s 1974 “Theme from Together Brothers,” transforming a movie score instrumental into a platinum, chant‑driven party anthem.[2]
- Before branding themselves as Quad City DJ’s, C.C. Lemonhead and Jay Ski were already behind several major ’90s club hits, including 95 South’s “Whoot, There It Is” and 69 Boyz’ “Tootsee Roll,” both of which went multi‑platinum.[2][3]
- The group’s *Space Jam* theme, originally just one track on the 1996 film soundtrack, later exploded in popularity online, spawning thousands of mash‑ups and over 50 million combined views, and becoming a shorthand sound for ’90s nostalgia.[3]
