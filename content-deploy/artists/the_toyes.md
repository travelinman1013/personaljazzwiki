## Biography
The Toyes are an American reggae band founded in 1982 by brothers Mawg (Jean-Christophe Kay) and Sky (Michael Kay) while living in Waikiki, Hawaii. Initially performing in a Honolulu cover band called The Lifters, the Kay brothers wrote their signature song 'Smoke Two Joints' during an impromptu jam session, inspired by the enthusiastic response of their friends. The song was quickly recorded with the help of their mother and local drummer Ricci Accardi, and it became an instant sensation in Hawaii, dominating local radio and igniting the band's early popularity.[1]

After leaving The Lifters, Mawg formed The Toyes (originally Tightrope) with Sky, Ricci, and singer Mike Dawson. The band soon changed their name to The Toyes after a legal threat from Motown Records. They toured the Hawaiian Islands and Guam, and 'Smoke Two Joints' became a cult classic, later featured in the soundtrack for the film 'Homegrown' and the video game 'Narc'. The Toyes relocated to Grants Pass, Oregon, where the lineup solidified with Mawg (lead guitar/vocals), B-dub (rhythm guitar/vocals), John Trujillo (bass/vocals), and Brian Rogers (drums/percussion).[1][2][3]

The Toyes are known for their unique blend of reggae and rock, described as a cross between Bob Marley and Barenaked Ladies. Their advocacy for marijuana legalization is a recurring theme in their music and public persona. The band's legacy is anchored by 'Smoke Two Joints', which has been widely covered and mistakenly attributed to other artists, most notably Sublime and Bob Marley. Their discography includes albums like 'Anchovy Picnic', which showcases their creative arrangements and storytelling approach.[1][2]
