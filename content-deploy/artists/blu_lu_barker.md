## Biography
Louise Dupont Barker, known professionally as Blue Lu Barker, was born on November 13, 1913, in New Orleans, Louisiana. Growing up in a vibrant musical environment, she began performing bawdy blues songs on street corners from a young age, influenced by the rich cultural tapestry of New Orleans. At just 13, she left school and married guitarist Danny Barker, with whom she moved to New York City in 1930. Their partnership would become central to her career, as Danny promoted her singing and facilitated her entry into the professional jazz and blues scene.[1][3][4]

Blue Lu Barker's recording career began in earnest in 1938 with her first session for Vocalion Records, where she adopted her stage name. Her debut single, "Don’t You Feel My Leg" (also known as "Don’t You Make Me High"), became an immediate hit and established her as a leading female blues vocalist. She recorded extensively for Decca, Apollo, and Capitol, collaborating with jazz legends and appearing alongside artists such as Cab Calloway and Jelly Roll Morton. Barker's style combined playful, risqué lyrics with a distinctive vocal delivery, blending swing, blues, and jazz influences. Her career spanned several decades, with notable periods of retirement and resurgence, including a final live recording at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival in 1998.[1][2][3][4]

Blue Lu Barker's legacy is deeply intertwined with the history of New Orleans jazz and blues. She was inducted into the Louisiana Blues Hall of Fame in 1997, and her funeral in 1998 was a major event in New Orleans, celebrated with traditional jazz funeral rites. Her influence extended beyond her recordings, inspiring artists such as Billie Holiday and contributing to the revival of traditional New Orleans jazz through her performances and collaborations. Barker's enduring appeal is reflected in the continued popularity of her songs, notably "Don’t You Feel My Leg," which was revived by Maria Muldaur in the 1980s.[1][2][3][4]
