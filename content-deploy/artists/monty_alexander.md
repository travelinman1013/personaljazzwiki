## Biography
Montgomery Bernard 'Monty' Alexander, born on June 6, 1944, in Kingston, Jamaica, displayed prodigious musical talent from a young age, playing Christmas carols by ear at four, entertaining neighbors by five, and taking formal piano lessons at six. By 14, he performed in local clubs and recorded early sessions with producers like Ken Khouri at Federal Records, marking the beginnings of ska alongside musicians such as Don Drummond, Roland Alphonso, and Ernest Ranglin. In 1961, at age 17, he moved to Miami with his mother and soon relocated to New York City in 1963, where he established himself in the jazz scene, playing nightly at Jilly's club owned by Frank Sinatra's friend Jilly Rizzo, accompanying celebrities like Sinatra, Miles Davis, and Count Basie.[1][2][3][5][6]

Alexander's career flourished as he bridged his Jamaican roots with hard-swinging jazz, recording over 75 albums, including a dozen for the MPS label from 1971-1985 at Oscar Peterson's endorsement, and projects like the Grammy-nominated Harlem-Kingston Express, which fused acoustic jazz trios with Jamaican electric bass and drums. Key works include Stir It Up (1999) interpreting Bob Marley with reggae rhythm section Gumption alongside jazz musicians like Troy Davis and Hassan Shakur, and Yard Movement. He performed Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue with Bobby McFerrin and orchestra at the 1996 Verbier Festival, contributed to soundtracks like Clint Eastwood's Bird (1988) and Quincy Jones' For Love of Ivy (1968), and played with legends including Dizzy Gillespie, Sonny Rollins, and Ray Brown.[1][3][4][5][6]

Recognized as the fifth greatest jazz pianist by Hal Leonard Publishing, Alexander received Jamaica's Order of Distinction in 2000, Order of Jamaica in 2022, and an honorary doctorate from the University of the West Indies in 2018. A Grammy-nominated artist with a vibrant, groove-driven style blending Caribbean flavors, romantic melodies, and sophisticated swing, he continues touring worldwide, embodying a unique fusion that honors both heritages.[2][5]
