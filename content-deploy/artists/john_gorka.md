## Biography
John Gorka is a celebrated American folk singer-songwriter, known for his soulful baritone voice and insightful songwriting. Born in New Jersey, Gorka's musical journey began in the late 1970s while studying Philosophy and History at Moravian College in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. He became deeply involved in the local music scene at Godfrey Daniels, a venerable coffeehouse, where he lived for a time and served as resident MC and sound man. There, he encountered and was inspired by legendary folk artists such as Stan Rogers, Eric Andersen, Tom Paxton, and Claudia Schmidt, which shaped his early musical direction.

Gorka's career gained momentum after he won the prestigious New Folk Award at the Kerrville Folk Festival in Texas in 1984. He soon became part of the influential Fast Folk circle in New York City, a hub for emerging singer-songwriters. His debut album, 'I Know,' was released in 1987, and he later signed with Windham Hill, producing five albums that brought him national attention, including airplay on VH1 and CMT. Over the years, Gorka has released over a dozen albums, including 'True in Time' (2018), and is recognized as a leading figure in the New Folk movement, admired for his wry, poignant reflections on everyday life and his engaging stage presence. His work has left a lasting mark on the contemporary folk and Americana landscape.
