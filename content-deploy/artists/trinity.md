## Biography
Trinity, born Wade Brammer on February 10, 1954, in Kingston, Jamaica, was a pioneering reggae deejay and producer who emerged as a significant figure in the development of dancehall music during the 1970s and 1980s. Educated at the Alpha Boys School, he initially performed under the stage name Prince Glen before adopting the moniker Trinity, inspired by a Spaghetti Western character. After working as a deejay on several Kingston sound systems, he made his professional debut in March 1976 with the single "Set Up Yourself" for producer Joseph Hoo Kim, quickly establishing himself as a prolific recording artist.

Throughout 1977, Trinity's career reached its zenith, recording more than 20 singles for various producers and achieving his biggest commercial success with "Three Piece Suit" for Joe Gibbs, which featured him toasting over a new version of Alton Ellis's "I'm Still In Love With You" riddim. This track marked a pivotal moment in reggae history, as it anticipated the shift from cultural lyrics to the more material and carnal concerns that would define the dancehall era. His 1977 album "Uptown Girl," produced by Bunny Lee, and subsequent releases like "Three Piece Chicken and Chips" (with Ranking Trevor) and "Showcase" established him as a major force in reggae music. In 1978, he performed at the legendary One Love Peace Concert in Kingston, cementing his status in Jamaican music.

Beyond his deejaying career, Trinity became an accomplished producer, establishing his own Flag Man record label in the late 1970s and producing both his own work and other artists. He collaborated with notable reggae figures including Dennis Brown, Barrington Levy, and The Mighty Diamonds throughout the late 1970s and 1980s. Later in his career, he transitioned from deejaying to singing, releasing albums under the name Junior Brammer, including "Telephone Line" and "Hold Your Corner" in 1987. Trinity continued his musical activities until his death on April 9, 2021, at the National Chest Hospital in Saint Andrew Parish, Jamaica, at the age of 67, from complications related to diabetes.
