## Biography
Morris Holt, known professionally as Magic Slim, was born on August 7, 1937, in Torrance, near Grenada, Mississippi, to a family of sharecroppers. He began his musical journey as a piano player but was forced to switch to guitar after losing his little finger in a cotton gin accident. In 1955, following the encouragement of his childhood friend Magic Sam, Slim migrated to Chicago to pursue a career in blues. Initially, he played bass in Magic Sam's band, absorbing the sounds and styles of Chicago's blues greats including Muddy Waters, Freddie King, and Otis Rush. Discouraged by the highly competitive local scene, Slim returned to Mississippi around 1960 to hone his craft, teaching his younger brothers Nick and Douglas "Lee Baby" Holt to play during this period of intensive musical development.

After returning to Chicago in the mid-1960s with renewed confidence and refined guitar skills, Slim joined Robert "Mr. Pitiful" Perkins & the Teardrops as lead guitarist. When Perkins departed, Slim assumed leadership of the band, which would become known simply as Magic Slim & the Teardrops. His recording career officially began in 1966 with singles for the Ja-Wes label, and he released his first album, *Born Under a Bad Sign*, in 1977 on the French MCM label. Throughout the 1980s and beyond, Slim recorded prolifically—releasing no fewer than 36 albums across labels including Alligator, Rooster Blues, Wolf Records, and Blind Pig Records. His trademark sound featured a raw, hard-hitting guitar style characterized by stinging licks and churning blues shuffles that could transform nearly any song into a powerful blues groove.

Magic Slim & the Teardrops became recognized as one of the last great Chicago blues bands and the quintessential representation of the city's post-war electric blues tradition. The band achieved international prominence, touring extensively throughout Europe, Japan, and South America, and developing a particularly devoted following in Lincoln, Nebraska, where Slim eventually relocated with his family. The group won the W.C. Handy Award (later renamed Blues Music Award) six times, including a 2003 honor as Blues Band of the Year. Magic Slim passed away on February 21, 2013, and was posthumously inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 2017. His legacy endures as a defining figure in Chicago blues, with Living Blues magazine calling him and the Teardrops "a national treasure" whose intense style became a blueprint for modern blues and rock musicians.

## Fun Facts
- Magic Slim lost his little finger in a cotton gin accident while working as a young man, which forced him to abandon his original instrument (piano) and switch to guitar—a setback that ultimately led to his legendary guitar career.
- His stage name "Magic Slim" was given to him by his friend Magic Sam, who was six months older. Slim took the name from Sam's nickname, creating a playful distinction between the two musicians in Chicago's blues scene.
- Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam was so impressed by one of Slim's electrifying live performances at a local Chicago nightclub that he invited Magic Slim to open a Pearl Jam concert in the city.
- Magic Slim had an encyclopedic repertoire of hundreds of blues songs memorized, which gave his live performances a charming impromptu quality—he could play almost any song upon request and transform it into his signature churning blues shuffle.
