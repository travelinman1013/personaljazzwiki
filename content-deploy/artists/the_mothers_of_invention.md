## Biography
The Mothers of Invention was an American rock band that emerged from California in the mid-1960s as one of the most innovative and experimental groups of their era. The band originated from a rhythm and blues group called The Soul Giants, which featured Ray Collins, David Coronado, Ray Hunt, Roy Estrada, and Jimmy Carl Black. In 1964, after Collins and the band's original saxophonist/leader Coronado had a dispute, Frank Zappa was invited to join as guitarist. Zappa quickly transformed the group's direction, insisting they perform his original compositions. On Mother's Day 1965, they renamed themselves The Mothers, and later became The Mothers of Invention after record executives at MGM Records required the name change when they signed with Verve Records in 1966.

Under Zappa's leadership as primary songwriter, composer, guitarist, and producer, The Mothers of Invention created a distinctive sound that defied conventional categorization. Their work combined rock, jazz, doo-wop, classical music, and free jazz elements with satirical lyrics, surreal imagery, and frequent parodies of contemporary pop music. The band released their groundbreaking debut double album 'Freak Out!' in 1966, recorded in just three days at TTG Studios with producer Tom Wilson. The lineup featured Zappa, Ray Collins, Jimmy Carl Black, Roy Estrada, and Elliot Ingber, with Don Preston joining shortly after. Throughout the late 1960s, they produced critically acclaimed albums including 'Absolutely Free' (1967), 'We're Only in It for the Money' (1968), and 'Uncle Meat' (1969), which proved enormously influential on the emerging progressive rock genre. Their performances were known for avant-garde compositions, audio experimentation, and extravagant live shows.

Zappa disbanded the original Mothers of Invention in 1969, but reformed the group in 1970 with an entirely new lineup featuring vocalists Mark Volman and Howard Kaylan (formerly of the Turtles, credited as Flo & Eddie due to contractual issues), along with Ian Underwood, Jeff Simmons, George Duke, and Aynsley Dunbar. This incarnation had a stronger vaudeville style and bawdier approach. After Zappa was pushed offstage at London's Rainbow Theatre in 1971, he dissolved this lineup. He formed a third and final version of The Mothers in 1973 while recovering from his injuries, featuring George Duke, Ian Underwood, Ruth Underwood, Ralph Humphrey, Sal Marquez, Bruce Fowler, and Tom Fowler. This lineup produced albums including 'Over-Nite Sensation' (1973), 'Roxy & Elsewhere' (1974), and 'One Size Fits All' (1975), showcasing tight performances of challenging jazz fusion compositions. The final Mothers album, 'Bongo Fury', was released in 1975, featuring additions Denny Walley and Terry Bozzio.

## Fun Facts
- The band was originally called The Soul Giants, then The Mothers, but MGM Records insisted on adding 'of Invention' to the name, which Zappa later said was born 'out of necessity' due to record executive concerns about the original name.
- The debut album 'Freak Out!' was recorded incredibly quickly in just three days at TTG Studios, demonstrating how well-rehearsed the band was. On the final night of recording, they invited local 'freaks' down to the studio with $500 worth of rented percussion equipment to participate in recording sides three and four.
- Several notable musicians appeared on 'Freak Out!' without proper credit, including Mac Rebannac (who later became Dr. John) on keyboards, Paul Butterfield, and Kim Fowley who sang on 'Help I'm A Rock'.
- Zappa formed a short-lived big band called the Grand Wazoo after breaking up the second Mothers lineup in 1971, following an incident where he was pushed offstage at London's Rainbow Theatre, before reforming the Mothers again in 1973 with a funkier, jazz fusion sound.
