## Biography
Lettuce is a North American funk band formed in the summer of 1992 in Boston, Massachusetts, when its founding members—teenagers attending a music program at Berklee College of Music—came together inspired by classic funk acts like Herbie Hancock, Earth, Wind & Fire, and Tower of Power. They jammed extensively that summer before parting ways, but reconvened in fall 1994 as Berklee undergrads, adopting the name 'Lettuce' from their persistent pleas to club owners: 'Let us play.' Early keyboardists included Michael Butler and Jeff Bhasker, with Neal Evans later joining; the band built a grassroots following through word-of-mouth in cities like New York, San Francisco, Chicago, and Tokyo.[1][2][5]

Releasing their debut album *Outta Here* in 2002 and *Live in Tokyo* in 2003, Lettuce evolved their sound, blending funk with hip-hop urgency, jazz fusion, rock, psychedelia, soul, and avant-garde elements. Their 2008 album *Rage!* paid homage to 1970s funk leaders with covers like Curtis Mayfield's 'Move on Up' and Charles Wright & the Watts 103rd Street Rhythm Band's 'Express Yourself.' Subsequent releases include *Fly* (2012), the chart-topping *Crush* (2015), *Elevate* (2019, Grammy-nominated for Instrumental Album of the Year), *Resonate* (2020), *Unify* (2022), and the fully improvised *VIBE* (recent).[1][3][6] Core members today are Adam 'Shmeeans' Smirnoff (guitar), Nigel Hall (keyboards, vocals), Adam Deitch (drums), Erick 'Maverick'/'Jesus' Coomes (bass), Ryan Zoidis (saxophone), and Eric 'Benny' Bloom (trumpet), with past and occasional contributions from Eric Krasno (guitar), Neal Evans (keyboards), and Rashawn Ross (trumpet).[1][2][3]

Known for incendiary live shows that capture spontaneous energy, Lettuce has toured relentlessly for over three decades, collaborating across genres and pushing funk boundaries while maintaining deep camaraderie rooted in their Berklee origins. Their music reflects a genre-defying collective spirit, influencing modern jam and fusion scenes.[2][3][6]

## Fun Facts

- Their 2020 album *Elevate* earned a Grammy nomination for Instrumental Album of the Year.[1]
- Lettuce's latest release *VIBE* is a single 48-minute track of pure improvisation, recorded without planning, editing, or overdubs.[3][6]
- Early keyboardists Michael Butler and Jeff Bhasker paved the way before Neal Evans joined, reflecting the band's evolving lineup from Berklee roots.[1]
