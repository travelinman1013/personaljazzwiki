## Biography
Louise Vant was an African-American jazz and blues vocalist who recorded during the mid-1920s, primarily for Okeh Records. Active during the classic blues era, she made her recordings between approximately 1925-1926, working frequently with bands organized by pianist and composer Perry Bradford. What distinguished Vant from many of her contemporaries was her versatility in repertoire - while other early Black jazz and blues vocalists of the period like Sara Martin and Bertha 'Chippie' Hill typically recorded more traditional blues material, Vant often performed popular songs of the day such as 'Show Me the Way to Go Home' and 'Save Your Sorrow.'

Vant's vocal style represented a compelling blend of soulful expression and sweet delivery, allowing her to cross between blues and popular music with equal effectiveness. Her recordings demonstrate a sophisticated approach to both genres, whether performing bluesier material with groups like Buddie Christian's Creole Five or tackling medium-tempo dance ballads like 'If You Hadn't Gone Away.' Her work with Perry Bradford's organized bands showcased her ability to work with some of the finest musicians of the era, including trombonist Jimmy Harrison and trumpeter Gus Aiken. Despite her evident talent and the quality of her recorded output, biographical details about her personal life and career beyond her recording activities remain largely unknown, reflecting the unfortunate lack of documentation that affects many artists from this pivotal period in American music history.

## Fun Facts
- Unlike many of her contemporaries who focused on traditional blues, Louise Vant often recorded popular dance songs and ballads, making her repertoire more diverse than typical blues singers of the era
- Her recording of 'If You Hadn't Gone Away' featured a young Jimmy Harrison on trombone, who would later become one of the most influential jazz trombonists of the swing era
- She recorded for Okeh Records, the same label that had launched the career of Mamie Smith with the first blues recording by an African-American artist in 1920
- Her accompanist Roy Banks was noted for his competent blues-modified Harlem stride piano style and also recorded with other notable artists including Alberta Jones
