## Biography
Terry Callier was born on May 24, 1945, in Chicago, Illinois, and grew up in the Cabrini-Green housing projects on the city’s north side. Surrounded by a rich musical environment, he was childhood friends with Curtis Mayfield, Major Lance, and Jerry Butler, and began singing in doo-wop groups as a teenager. Callier’s early exposure to Chicago’s vibrant soul and jazz scenes deeply influenced his musical direction, leading to his first single, the northern soul classic 'Look at Me Now,' released on Chess Records in 1962.

Rather than following a conventional soul path, Callier’s debut album, 'The New Folk Sound of Terry Callier' (recorded in 1964, released in 1968), showcased his unique blend of folk, jazz, and soul, marked by complex time signatures and influences from John Coltrane. Throughout the 1970s, he collaborated with producer Charles Stepney on a trilogy of albums for Cadet Records, including the critically acclaimed 'What Color Is Love.' Despite critical praise, commercial success eluded him, and by the 1980s, Callier left music to focus on raising his daughter and pursued a career in computer programming, earning a degree in sociology.

A resurgence of interest in his work during the 1990s, particularly from the British acid-jazz scene, led to a late-career revival. Callier returned to recording and performing, collaborating with contemporary artists like Massive Attack and Beth Orton. His deeply spiritual, genre-blending style and poetic songwriting have since been recognized as highly influential, leaving a lasting legacy in soul, jazz, and folk music.
