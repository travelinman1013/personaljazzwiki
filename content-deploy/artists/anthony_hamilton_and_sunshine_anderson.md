## Biography
Anthony Hamilton and Sunshine Anderson are individual R&B artists who share a notable musical connection through their collaboration on the 2001 duet 'Last Night,' featured on Anderson's debut album *Your Woman* and Hamilton's compilation *Soulife*. Sunshine Anderson emerged in the early 2000s, managed by Macy Gray and signed to Soulife Records, the same early label home for Hamilton. Her breakout single 'Heard It All Before' reached #3 on the R&B charts, propelling *Your Woman* to gold status, while tracks like 'Lunch Or Dinner' showcased her earnest lyrics and laid-back grooves[1]. Anthony Hamilton, starting his career in church choirs at age 10, moved to New York in 1993 and signed with Andre Harrell's Uptown Records, later writing songs for artists including Anderson during his development phase[3][4].

Anderson's career continued with a sophomore album *Sunshine At Midnight* in 2007 under Mathew Knowles' Music World Entertainment, featuring singles like 'Something I Wanna Give You,' though it did not replicate her debut success, leading her to step back as a married mother[1]. Hamilton gained wider recognition post-collaboration, building on his songwriting for Anderson and others like Donell Jones, transitioning from background work to his own acclaimed soulful R&B solo career[3][5]. Their joint work highlights a shared soulful R&B style rooted in emotional, relationship-driven narratives.

A  documentary titled *Unfinished Business* explores Anderson's story, featuring Hamilton among others, underscoring their lasting professional tie in the R&B scene[2]. While neither achieved blockbuster longevity, their early 2000s output remains influential in soul and R&B circles.
