## Biography
The Boswell Sisters were a pioneering American close-harmony vocal trio made up of **Martha Boswell** (1905–1958), **Connee/Connie Boswell** (1907–1976) and **Helvetia “Vet” Boswell** (1911–1988). Raised in New Orleans after early childhood years in Kansas City and Birmingham, they grew up in a musically rich, middle-class household where their mother encouraged both classical study and immersion in the city’s diverse sounds, including Black gospel, blues, and early jazz.[1][4][5] All three were first trained as instrumentalists—Martha on piano, Vet on violin, guitar, and banjo, and Connee on cello, saxophone, trombone, and guitar—and even appeared with the New Orleans Philharmonic before gradually shifting focus to vocal work in the mid‑1920s.[4][5] Connee, who used a wheelchair or sat to perform because of childhood paralysis (likely polio, long described publicly as an accident), nonetheless became the group’s charismatic lead voice and artistic focal point.[1][4]

By 1925 the sisters were performing on New Orleans radio and cutting early records for Victor; touring on the vaudeville circuit took them to California and then to Chicago and New York, where national radio exposure and film work brought widespread fame.[1][2][4][5] Their breakthrough sound emerged when Connee, singing through a cold, moved close to the microphone and sang at half‑volume, creating an intimate, close-harmony blend that many historians credit as one of the earliest deliberate uses of microphone technique in popular singing.[5] Between roughly 1930 and 1935 they became one of the most popular vocal groups in the United States, recording extensively for Brunswick with leading jazz players such as the Dorsey Brothers, Benny Goodman, Joe Venuti, Eddie Lang, and Bunny Berigan, appearing in Hollywood films like *The Big Broadcast* (1932) and *Moulin Rouge* (1934), and starring on network radio, including their own CBS show and regular features on Bing Crosby’s program.[2][4][5] Their arrangements, sometimes called the “Boswell treatment,” were notable for extremely tight close harmony, scat singing, instrumental imitations, abrupt key and tempo changes, and sophisticated swing feel on songs like “Heebie Jeebies,” “Crazy People,” “Shout, Sister, Shout,” and “Was That the Human Thing to Do?”[2][5]

The trio’s recording career wound down in 1936 as Martha and Vet chose to retire for marriage and family life, while Connee—by then married to their manager, Harry Leedy—continued as a successful solo artist.[3][4] She scored hits in the 1940s and 1950s, including “Moonlight Mood” (1942) and “If I Give My Heart to You” (1954), and recorded popular duets with Bing Crosby such as “Bob White (Whatcha Gonna Swing Tonight)” and “Alexander’s Ragtime Band,” extending the Boswell legacy well into the postwar era.[3][4] Although their time as an active trio was relatively brief, the Boswell Sisters profoundly influenced later close-harmony groups and jazz singers; their innovative blend of New Orleans jazz sensibility, technical precision, and adventurous arrangements helped define early swing-era vocal style and cemented their reputation as one of the first and finest jazz vocal trios in American popular music.[2][3][5]

## Fun Facts
- The Boswell Sisters stumbled onto their signature intimate sound by accident when Connee, singing with a cold, moved closer to the microphone and sang at half‑volume—an approach often cited as one of the earliest deliberate uses of modern microphone technique in pop singing.[5]
- Despite being paralyzed from the waist down since childhood—likely due to polio—Connee Boswell performed seated, played multiple instruments, and sustained a high-profile solo career in an era with very little visibility for disabled entertainers.[1][4]
- Their arrangements were so intricate and idiosyncratic that fans and musicians referred to them as giving songs the “Boswell treatment,” characterized by rapid-fire key and tempo changes, tight jazz harmonies, and scat passages that radically reworked familiar tunes.[2][5]
- In 1998, Vet Boswell’s daughter Chica, along with her own daughter Kyla Titus and a team of musicologists, founded the Boswell Museum of Music in upstate New York to preserve and promote the trio’s legacy.[3]

## Musical Connections

### Mentors/Influences
- [[new_orleans_jazz_blues_and_gospel_musicians_collective_influence|New Orleans jazz, blues, and gospel musicians (collective influence)]] - As children and teenagers in New Orleans, the sisters absorbed local Black gospel, blues, and early jazz, which deeply shaped their rhythmic feel, phrasing, and repertoire, alongside their formal classical training. (General influence heard across recordings such as “Heebie Jeebies,” “Shout, Sister, Shout,” and other 1930–35 Brunswick sides.) [1910s–1920s]
- [[classical_music_teachers_and_new_orleans_philharmonic_milieu|Classical music teachers and New Orleans Philharmonic milieu]] - Formal classical instruction and orchestral performance experience gave them strong musicianship, ensemble discipline, and arranging sophistication that later informed their complex vocal charts. (Early classical and semi‑classical performances, including appearances with the New Orleans Philharmonic before 1925.) [1910s–early 1920s]

### Key Collaborators
- [[dorsey_brothers_tommy_and_jimmy_dorsey|Dorsey Brothers (Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey)]] - The sisters frequently recorded with the Dorsey Brothers’ orchestra during their peak years, combining their close harmonies with leading swing instrumentalists. (Multiple Brunswick recordings between 1930 and 1936, often billed with Dorsey Brothers accompaniment.) [c. 1930–1935]
- [[benny_goodman|Benny Goodman]] - Goodman and his musicians appeared on various Boswell Sisters recording sessions, contributing to the jazz-driven swing sound of their Brunswick sides. (Brunswick recordings in the early‑to‑mid 1930s featuring Benny Goodman and his orchestra.[2][4]) [c. 1930–1935]
- [[joe_venuti_and_eddie_lang|Joe Venuti and Eddie Lang]] - Top jazz violinist Joe Venuti and guitarist Eddie Lang appeared on recordings with the Boswells, adding virtuosic string playing to their vocal arrangements. (Selected Brunswick sessions in the early 1930s.[2]) [early 1930s]
- [[bunny_berigan|Bunny Berigan]] - Trumpeter Bunny Berigan participated in some of their Brunswick sessions, reinforcing the hot‑jazz character of their arrangements. (Early‑1930s Brunswick recordings with jazz orchestra backing.[2]) [early 1930s]
- [[bing_crosby|Bing Crosby]] - The Boswell Sisters were regulars on Bing Crosby’s radio program, and Connee later recorded popular duet hits with him during her solo career. (Radio appearances in the early 1930s; later duets including “Bob White (Whatcha Gonna Swing Tonight)” and “Alexander’s Ragtime Band,” both number‑one hits for Connee.[4]) [c. early 1930s (trio) and late 1930s–1940s (Connee solo)]
- [[nbc_and_cbs_radio_networks_producers_and_house_bands|NBC and CBS radio networks (producers and house bands)]] - Network radio shows, including a CBS program given to them by Bill Paley and earlier NBC contracts, provided orchestral backing and nationwide exposure. (CBS show starting 1934; NBC contract that brought them to New York in 1931.[2][3]) [early–mid 1930s]
- [[harry_leedy|Harry Leedy]] - Initially the trio’s manager, Leedy was crucial in negotiating their NBC contract and shaping their career; he later became Connee’s husband and continued as her manager. (Management of the Boswell Sisters’ move to New York; ongoing guidance of Connee’s solo recordings such as “Moonlight Mood.”[3]) [c. 1930–1975 (Boswell Sisters as a group through 1936; Connee thereafter)]

### Artists Influenced
- [[the_andrews_sisters|The Andrews Sisters]] - The Andrews Sisters, later famed as the leading female vocal group of the 1940s, openly acknowledged that they modeled much of their close-harmony style on the Boswell Sisters’ sound.

- [[ella_fitzgerald|Ella Fitzgerald]] - Ella Fitzgerald cited Connee Boswell as one of her major influences, particularly in terms of phrasing, swing feel, and jazz-pop crossover. (Fitzgerald’s early swing recordings with Chick Webb and her later solo interpretations reflect lessons drawn from Connee’s singing.[3]) [1930s–1950s and later]
- [[later_close-harmony_vocal_groups_and_jazzpop_vocalists|Later close-harmony vocal groups and jazz/pop vocalists]] - Historic New Orleans Collection notes that although their stardom was brief, the Boswells influenced close-harmony groups and solo artists for decades, helping to define the vocabulary of swing-era vocal arranging. (Broad impact on mid‑20th‑century vocal group arranging and on solo jazz singers’ use of microphone, scat, and rhythmic flexibility.[3][5]) [1930s onward]
