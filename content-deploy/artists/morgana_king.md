## Biography
Maria Grazia Morgana Messina (June 4, 1930 – March 22, 2018), better known as Morgana King, was an American jazz singer and actress born in Pleasantville, New York, of Sicilian descent.[1][2] She began her professional singing career at age sixteen, performing in New York and Long Island hospitals and clubs for ex-service personnel.[2] Her breakthrough came in 1953 when a record label executive discovered her performing at a Greenwich Village nightclub, impressed by her unique phrasing and extraordinary four-octave contralto vocal range.[1][2] She was reportedly renamed "Morgana" by mob boss Frank Costello, who owned the Greenwich Village Inn where she worked.[2] Her first album, *For You, For Me, For Evermore*, was released in 1956, marking the beginning of a prolific recording career that would span decades.[1]

King's musical style was distinctive and innovative, characterized by what The New York Times described as "an astounding melange of humming, singing and vocalising, creating tapestries of supple sounds that float in the air, that slither sinuously around a melody, that dip down to some visceral foundation or soar softly off into the stratosphere as an ethereal mutter."[2] Her breakthrough hit came in 1964 with "A Taste of Honey," which earned her a Grammy nomination for Best New Artist in 1965, though she lost to The Beatles.[2][4] She was among the first American artists to embrace bossa nova after discovering it during a trip to Brazil with her second husband, trombonist Willie Dennis.[2] King recorded over thirty albums throughout her career, working with labels including Mercury, Atlantic, Reprise, and Muse, with particular success in the 1970s and 1980s when she recorded nine albums for the Muse label.[3][4]

Beyond her music career, King achieved significant recognition as an actress, most notably playing Mama Corleone in Francis Ford Coppola's *The Godfather* (1972) and *The Godfather Part II* (1974).[5] She read Mario Puzo's novel two years before being cast without a screen test, and used hypnotherapy to prepare for the role.[2] Despite never achieving mainstream commercial success, King remained committed to her artistic integrity, famously stating: "I am a rebel. I am not a commercial artist. If I don't believe in something, I won't do it."[2] She toured extensively throughout the United States, Europe, Australia, and South America, performing at prestigious venues including the Blue Note, Cotton Club, and Rainbow Grill.[1] King passed away on March 22, 2018, leaving behind a legacy as a respected jazz vocalist whose innovative vocal techniques and artistic independence influenced generations of musicians.

## Fun Facts
- At age 16, King performed at the Crystal Caverns nightclub in Washington, D.C., where she pretended to be Creole because few white performers worked there. When discovered, she admitted she was Sicilian, and the club owners accepted this, billing her as the 'Creole songbird from the Ramparts section of New Orleans.'[2]
- King was reportedly renamed 'Morgana' by mob boss Frank Costello, who owned the Greenwich Village Inn where she worked early in her career.[2]
- She used hypnotherapy to prepare for her role as Mama Corleone in *The Godfather*, programming and conditioning herself to become a member of the cast after reading Mario Puzo's novel two years before being cast.[2]
- Cole Porter wrote King a fan letter during her early career, yet the general public remained largely unaware of her work until her later breakthrough in the 1960s.[4]
