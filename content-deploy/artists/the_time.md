## Biography
The Time is a Minneapolis-based funk and dance-pop band formed in 1981 under the guidance of Prince, who sought to create a group that would serve as both protégés and rivals within his musical universe. Built from the remnants of local funk units Flyte Tyme and Enterprise, the original lineup featured Morris Day (vocals), Jellybean Johnson (drums), Jimmy Jam and Monte Moir (keyboards), Terry Lewis (bass), Jesse Johnson (guitar), and Jerome Benton (percussion). Prince was instrumental in shaping the band's sound, composing and arranging much of their early material, and using The Time as an outlet for his funkier, more playful musical ideas[1][2][3].

The Time quickly gained recognition for their energetic live performances and infectious blend of funk, pop, rock, and post-disco. Their early albums, including 'The Time' (1981), 'What Time Is It?' (1982), and 'Ice Cream Castle' (1984), produced R&B hits like "Get It Up," "777-9311," "Jungle Love," and "The Bird." While the band's music was often lighthearted and humorous in contrast to Prince's more introspective work, their musicianship and stage presence made them a formidable act, sometimes even outshining Prince as his opening act[1][2][3].

Despite internal tensions and lineup changes—most notably the departures of Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, who became legendary producers, and Morris Day's brief exit for a solo career—The Time left an indelible mark on the Minneapolis sound and 1980s funk. The group reunited several times, notably for the 1990 album 'Pandemonium' and the 2011 project 'Condensate' (as The Original 7ven), and continues to tour as Morris Day and The Time, cementing their legacy as one of funk's most influential ensembles[1][2][4][6].

## Fun Facts
- The Time was originally created by Prince as a 'rival' act to himself, with the intention of fostering creative competition within his own musical circle.
- The band's early albums were largely written and performed by Prince (with Morris Day on vocals), with the rest of the band sometimes only adding parts later.
- Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, after leaving The Time, became one of the most successful songwriting and production duos in pop and R&B history, working with artists like Janet Jackson and earning numerous Grammy Awards.
- The Time's energetic live shows sometimes outshone Prince's own performances, leading to playful onstage rivalries and legendary tour stories.
