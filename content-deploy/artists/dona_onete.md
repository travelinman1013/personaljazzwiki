## Biography
Dona Onete, born Ionete da Silveira Gama on June 18, 1939 in Cachoeira do Arari, Pará, Brazil, is celebrated as the 'Queen of Carimbó.' Growing up in Igarapé-Miri, she was immersed in the musical traditions of the Amazon from a young age, singing sambas, quadrilles, and boi bumba by age fifteen. Her early career was rooted in education: she taught history and Amazonian studies for 25 years, researched local rhythms and dances, and was active in cultural preservation, founding music and dance groups and serving as Secretary of Culture in Igarapé-Miri[1][2][3][4][5].

Remarkably, Dona Onete only began her professional music career after retirement, recording her debut album 'Feitiço Caboclo' at age 73. She developed a unique hybrid genre known as 'carimbó chamegado,' blending traditional Amazonian rhythms with contemporary influences. Her music, rich in regional identity and poetic lyricism, quickly gained national and international recognition, leading to performances across Brazil, Europe, and the United States[1][3][4].

Beyond her musical achievements, Dona Onete is a respected activist and educator. She played a key role in founding the Sindicato dos Trabalhadores e Trabalhadoras em Educação Pública do Pará (SINTEPP) and was involved in the early days of the Central Única dos Trabalhadores (CUT). Her legacy encompasses not only her innovative contributions to Brazilian music but also her lifelong commitment to cultural and social advocacy[2][3][5].
