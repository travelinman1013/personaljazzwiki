## Biography
John Hyman's Bayou Stompers was a New Orleans jazz band led by cornetist John Wigginton Hyman (later known as Johnny Wiggs), who was born in New Orleans on July 25, 1899. The group made its first recordings in 1927 on the Victor label, capturing the sound of traditional New Orleans jazz during a pivotal era. Hyman, who had started his musical career on violin before switching to cornet, drew his stylistic influences from Bix Beiderbecke and King Oliver, particularly Oliver's pre-recording work in New Orleans. The band represented the authentic New Orleans jazz tradition during the late 1920s, though their recordings did not achieve the commercial success of contemporaries like Louis Armstrong and Jelly Roll Morton.

Despite the quality of their recordings, John Hyman's Bayou Stompers faced the challenge of jazz's marginal social status during this period. The Orleans Parish School Board held an unfavorable attitude toward jazz, which eventually led Hyman to adopt the pseudonym "Johnny Wiggs" to protect his day job as a teacher of music and architectural drawing. He worked as a high school teacher, journalist, and merchant seaman while maintaining his musical career. The Bayou Stompers' recordings on Victor remain important historical documents of New Orleans jazz in the 1920s, preserving the sound of traditional jazz before the swing era transformed the genre. Though the band's commercial impact was limited, Hyman would later become a crucial figure in the New Orleans jazz revival of the 1940s, helping to found the New Orleans Jazz Club and mentoring a new generation of musicians, including the famous clarinetist Pete Fountain.
