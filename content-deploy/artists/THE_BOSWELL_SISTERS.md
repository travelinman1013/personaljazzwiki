## Biography
The Boswell Sisters were a pioneering American vocal trio, celebrated for their intricate harmonies and innovative arrangements during the jazz and swing eras. Consisting of Martha, Connie (later Connee), and Helvetia 'Vet' Boswell, the sisters were born in Kansas City and Birmingham but grew up in New Orleans, where they were immersed in the city's rich musical traditions. Initially trained in classical music and proficient on multiple instruments—Martha on piano, Vet on violin, banjo, and guitar, and Connie on cello, saxophone, and trombone—they began performing in local theaters and on radio in their teens, blending classical, jazz, and popular styles[1][2][3][4].

Their career took off in the late 1920s and early 1930s, as they transitioned from vaudeville circuits to national radio and recording contracts. The Boswell Sisters became renowned for their close harmony singing, rhythmic experimentation, and creative use of scat, tempo changes, and vocal effects. Their arrangements often fused elements of Southern gospel, blues, and ragtime, reflecting both their classical training and the vibrant New Orleans jazz scene. The trio collaborated with leading swing musicians such as the Dorsey Brothers, Glenn Miller, Benny Goodman, and Artie Shaw, helping to shape the big band sound of the era[1][2].

The group disbanded in 1936, but Connee Boswell continued as a successful solo artist for decades. The Boswell Sisters' legacy endures through their profound influence on later vocal groups and soloists, notably inspiring the Andrews Sisters and Ella Fitzgerald. Scholars credit them with making jazz commercially viable and destigmatizing the genre, opening its appreciation to a wider American public[1][2][5].
