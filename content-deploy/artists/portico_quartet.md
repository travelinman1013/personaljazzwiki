## Biography
Portico Quartet is a British instrumental band formed in London in 2005, emerging from two sets of school friends who began their musical journey busking along the South Bank of the Thames. The original lineup featured Jack Wyllie (saxophones, electronics), Duncan Bellamy (drums), Milo Fitzpatrick (double bass), and Nick Mulvey (hang and percussion). Their distinctive sound, built around the rare and ethereal Hang drum, quickly set them apart from other jazz and nu jazz groups, blending elements of jazz, ambient, and world music into a unique sonic palette. Their grassroots approach—playing small gigs and busking outside the National Theatre—helped them build a devoted following and hone their innovative style.[1][2][3][6]

The band's debut album, 'Knee Deep in the North Sea' (2007), was a critical breakthrough, earning a Mercury Music Prize nomination and widespread acclaim for its fresh approach to jazz. This success led to a deal with Real World Records, where their sound evolved further on albums like 'Isla' (2009) and their self-titled 'Portico Quartet' (2012). Over time, the group continued to experiment, incorporating more electronic textures and ambient influences, especially after Mulvey's departure in 2011 and the arrival of Keir Vine. Their willingness to reinvent themselves—at one point even dropping 'Quartet' from their name—has kept their music at the forefront of contemporary jazz innovation.[3][4][5]

Portico Quartet's legacy lies in their ability to bridge genres and introduce the Hang drum to a wider audience, influencing a new generation of musicians interested in the intersections of jazz, electronic, and world music. Their music is recognized for its cinematic quality, emotional depth, and the seamless integration of acoustic and electronic elements, making them a standout act in the modern jazz landscape.[1][2][8]

## Fun Facts
- The band's name comes from an impromptu gig played under a portico in Italy after rain forced them to seek shelter.[3]
- Portico Quartet introduced the Hang drum—a rare Swiss percussion instrument—to the jazz mainstream, making it central to their sound.[1][3]
- They sold 10,000 copies of their self-pressed debut EP while busking on London's South Bank before signing a record deal.[2]
- After Nick Mulvey left to pursue a solo career, the band experimented with sampling and electronic manipulation of the Hang drum's sounds.[5]
