## Biography
Ivory Joe Hunter was born on October 10, 1914, in Kirbyville, Texas, into a deeply musical family. His mother was a gospel singer and his father, Dave Hunter, played guitar. Contrary to assumptions, Ivory Joe was his given name, not a stage name—according to Hunter, his parents thought he looked like the baby on the Castoria Ivory bottle when he was born. He showed exceptional musical talent early, becoming a proficient pianist by age 13 and playing in school orchestras. After his parents died when he was thirteen, he moved to Port Arthur to live with relatives, graduating from Lincoln High School in 1930. By 1933, at just 19 years old, he made his first recording for Alan Lomax and the Library of Congress under the pseudonym Ivory Joe White.

Hunter's professional career took off in the early 1940s when he hosted his own radio show on KFDM in Beaumont, Texas, eventually becoming program manager. In 1942, he relocated to California's West Coast, where he demonstrated his entrepreneurial spirit by starting his own label, Ivory Records, in Oakland. His first commercial hit, "Blues at Sunrise," became a regional success. Throughout the late 1940s and 1950s, Hunter recorded for multiple labels including 4 Star, King, MGM, and Atlantic, earning the nicknames "The Baron of the Boogie" and "The Happiest Man Alive." His breakthrough came in 1950 when "I Almost Lost My Mind" topped the R&B charts, followed by "I Need You So" reaching number 2. His biggest crossover success was "Since I Met You Baby" (1956), which reached number 12 on the pop charts and became his only top forty pop hit.

Hunter's musical versatility was remarkable, seamlessly moving between R&B, blues, boogie-woogie, and country music. As R&B's popularity waned in the 1960s, he successfully transitioned to country music, moving to Nashville and performing regularly at the Grand Ole Opry. He became one of the few artists honored at both the Monterey Jazz Festival and the Grand Ole Opry, reflecting his unique crossover appeal. As a prolific songwriter who reportedly wrote over 7,000 songs during his lifetime, his compositions were covered by major artists including Pat Boone, Elvis Presley, and Sonny James, whose 1969 version of "Since I Met You Baby" topped the country charts. Hunter's influence extended to important artists like Isaac Hayes and Ray Charles. He was named Cash Box's "Jazz and Blues Artist of the Year" in 1950. Despite his success, mounting medical bills from declining health drained his finances. He died of lung cancer in Memphis, Tennessee, on November 8, 1974, and was buried in his hometown of Kirbyville. A Texas Historical Marker was erected in his honor in Jasper County in 2009, and he is commemorated in the Museum of the Gulf Coast's Music Hall of Fame in Port Arthur.
