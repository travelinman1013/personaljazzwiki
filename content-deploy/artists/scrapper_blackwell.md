## Biography
Francis Hillman 'Scrapper' Blackwell was born on February 21, 1903, in Syracuse, South Carolina, and moved to Indianapolis, Indiana, as a child, where he spent most of his life. He was one of 16 children and reportedly had Cherokee ancestry. Blackwell was self-taught as a guitarist, building his first instrument from a cigar box, wood, and wire, and later learned piano. His nickname 'Scrapper' was given by his grandmother due to his fiery personality. By his teens, he was performing part-time and traveling as far as Chicago, establishing himself as a distinctive country blues guitarist and singer.

Blackwell's career reached its peak in the late 1920s and early 1930s as the guitarist in the influential duo with pianist Leroy Carr. Their partnership produced over 100 recordings, including the landmark hit 'How Long, How Long Blues' (1928), and helped define the urban blues sound of the era. After Carr's death in 1935, Blackwell retired from music for a time but returned in the late 1950s, recording several solo albums that showcased his raw, articulate guitar style and emotive vocals. He was tragically killed in a mugging in Indianapolis in 1962 at age 59.

Blackwell's legacy is marked by his innovative guitar technique, which blended blues, ragtime, and jazz influences, and his ability to create a unique, personal sound. His work has been cited by major artists like Bob Dylan as foundational to the development of American music. Blackwell was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 2024, cementing his status as a pivotal figure in the history of the blues.
