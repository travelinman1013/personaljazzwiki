## Biography
TCR was an American industrial rock duo formed by Robin Moulder, best known as the bassist and co-founder of Jack Off Jill, and TC Smith, a vocalist and programmer known for her work with Triggerpimp and other alternative acts. The project emerged after the dissolution of Jack Off Jill in 2000, when Moulder and Smith—who had become friends through the alternative music scene—decided to collaborate despite living in different cities. Their creative process was notably modern for its time, relying on remote collaboration via phone, FedEx, and FTP to exchange ideas and recordings.

In 2004, TCR released their only album, 'The Chrome Recordings,' which blended elements of metal, industrial, rock, goth, and punk. The album was praised by some reviewers as one of the best goth/industrial releases of the year, and featured guest appearances from notable musicians such as Chris Vrenna (formerly of Nine Inch Nails), Scott Putesky (aka Daisy Berkowitz, formerly of Marilyn Manson), and method from Godhead. Although TCR was short-lived, their music is remembered for its aggressive fusion of genres and its DIY, cross-country production ethos.

Following TCR, both members continued to pursue creative endeavors: Moulder co-founded the game development studio 3lb Games, while Smith continued her music and voiceover career, contributing to film trailers and scores. TCR remains a cult favorite among fans of early 2000s industrial and goth rock.
