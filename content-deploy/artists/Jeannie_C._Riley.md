## Biography
Jeannie C. Riley, born Jeanne Carolyn Stephenson on October 19, 1945, in Anson, Texas, embarked on her musical journey after relocating to Nashville, Tennessee.  This move followed a pivotal moment when Weldon Myrick, impressed by a demo tape, encouraged her pursuit of a music career. While working as a secretary for Passkey Music, Riley continued recording demos, laying the groundwork for her future success.  Her early influences and teachers are not explicitly mentioned in the provided text.

Riley's career experienced a significant turning point when Shelby Singleton, a producer, heard her demo and saw potential in the Tom T. Hall song "Harper Valley PTA."  The resulting recording catapulted Riley to stardom in 1968, topping both the Billboard Country and Pop charts. This achievement made her the first woman to achieve this feat, a record unbroken until Dolly Parton's success with "9 to 5" in 1981.  The song's success led to a Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance, a Country Music Association Single of the Year award, and nominations for Best New Artist and Record of the Year.  Further career highlights included hosting her own network variety special, *Harper Valley U.S.A.*, in 1969, with performances by Jerry Reed and Mel Tillis.  She also performed a duet with Loretta Lynn and continued to chart with songs like "The Girl Most Likely," "There Never Was A Time," and "The Rib," among others.  She later transitioned to MGM Records in 1972 and subsequently recorded with Mercury and Warner Bros. Records.

Riley's musical style blended country and pop elements, and her image, initially cultivated by her publicist and manager, played a significant role in her success.  She became known for her sex appeal and fashion choices, notably miniskirts and go-go boots, which contrasted with the more traditional image of many female country artists at the time.  This image, however, was not entirely comfortable for Riley, and she later adopted a more conventional wardrobe.  Her career spanned decades, encompassing both country and gospel music after her conversion to Christianity in the mid-1970s.  She published an autobiography, *From Harper Valley to the Mountain Top*, in 1980, which detailed her journey from country music stardom to her embrace of gospel music.  Her legacy includes a lasting impact on country music, particularly for female artists, and her induction into the Texas Country Music Hall of Fame in 2019.
