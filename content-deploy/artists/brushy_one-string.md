## Biography
Andrew Chin, known professionally as **Brushy One-String**, is a Jamaican singer‑songwriter and guitarist from Ocho Rios, Jamaica, celebrated for performing with a single‑string acoustic guitar. Born into a deeply musical family — his father was noted Jamaican soul and reggae singer Freddie McKay and his mother, Beverly Foster, toured as a backing vocalist with Tina Turner — he was orphaned at a young age and left school early, remaining illiterate until adulthood.[5][9][2] Growing up with little material support but surrounded by sound, he experimented with pots, pans, and eventually guitar, but initially struggled with the standard six‑string instrument; he recalls playing so hard that he broke all the strings and pushed the guitar under his bed.[1][5] 

In his mid‑teens, Chin had a vivid dream or vision instructing him to remove all but one string from his guitar and play it that way, an idea that family and friends largely mocked except for one person who told him it was his fate.[1][5][2] Taking the dream seriously, he restrung the guitar with a single low‑E string, developed a percussive style that uses the guitar body as a drum, and began busking in markets in a broad hat and sunglasses, singing songs that came directly from his daily struggles and surroundings.[1][5] After modest early recording activity, including cult‑status releases on the Roof International reggae label in the early 1990s, he drifted back to street performance, where filmmaker Luciano Blotta rediscovered him outside a rural studio around 2004 and recorded his song “Chicken in the Corn” for the 2007 documentary *Rise Up*.[4][2][5] A live performance video of “Chicken in the Corn” uploaded to YouTube in 2013 went viral, eventually garnering tens of millions of views and establishing him as the self‑styled “King of One String,” leading to festival appearances at South by Southwest, New Orleans House of Blues, and the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, as well as the documentary *The King of One String* (2014) and albums such as his acclaimed studio debut *Destiny* (2013) and *Live at New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival* (2015).[4][5][7]

Brushy One‑String’s music fuses **reggae, soul, rhythm and blues, and Delta blues** into a stripped‑down but full‑sounding style built from one vibrating string, syncopated knocks on the guitar body, and his resonant, emotionally charged voice.[1][3][5] He cites soul singer Teddy Pendergrass and dancehall star Shabba Ranks as key influences, and commentators have linked his one‑string approach to older blues instruments like the diddley bow and monochord zithers.[1][3][5] Despite the apparent minimalism of his setup, his songs are narrative and uplifting, often reflecting on hardship, perseverance, and destiny, and he has come to be regarded as an off‑the‑beaten‑path Jamaican “national treasure,” demonstrating how resourcefulness and individuality can carve out a distinctive place in contemporary roots music.[4][3][5]

## Fun Facts
- Brushy One-String performs on a standard acoustic guitar fitted with only a single low‑E string, using the remaining tuning pegs as makeshift percussion and the guitar body as a drum.[1][4][5]
- He was illiterate until adulthood and has said he primarily learned to read so that he could write his own lyrics and properly credit himself on songs after being exploited in an early recording contract.[4][3]
- The idea to strip his guitar down to one string came from a vivid dream he had as a teenager; despite initial ridicule from most people around him, he followed the vision and built his entire career on that one string.[1][2][5]
- His breakthrough song “Chicken in the Corn,” first captured informally by filmmaker Luciano Blotta, became a viral hit on YouTube in 2013, eventually attracting tens of millions of views and turning a street performance staple into an international calling card.[2][5][7]
