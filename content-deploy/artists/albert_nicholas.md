## Biography
Albert Nicholas (May 27, 1900 – September 3, 1973) was a distinguished American jazz clarinetist and saxophonist, born in the Creole section of New Orleans, Louisiana. He began his musical journey studying clarinet under the renowned Lorenzo Tio, Jr., a foundational figure in early jazz clarinet technique. By his late teens, Nicholas was performing with New Orleans jazz legends such as Buddy Petit, King Oliver, and Manuel Perez, and he led his own band at Tom Anderson’s Annex in 1922.

After serving three years in the Merchant Marines, Nicholas joined King Oliver’s band in Chicago from 1925 to 1927, recording with the Dixie Syncopators. He then spent time in East Asia and Egypt before settling in New York City in 1928, where he became a key soloist with Luis Russell’s orchestra until 1933. Nicholas’s career included collaborations with major jazz figures such as Chick Webb, Louis Armstrong, and Jelly Roll Morton, with whom he recorded during two separate periods. The Dixieland jazz revival of the late 1940s revitalized his career, leading to work with Bunk Johnson, Kid Ory, Art Hodes, and Ralph Sutton.

In 1953, Nicholas moved permanently to France, where he remained a sought-after performer and recording artist for the rest of his life, only returning to the United States for occasional recording sessions. His playing was celebrated for its warm, mellow tone and expressive phrasing, making him an instantly recognizable soloist and a significant figure in the preservation and evolution of traditional New Orleans jazz.
