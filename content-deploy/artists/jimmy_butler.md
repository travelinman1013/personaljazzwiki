## Biography
Jerry Butler Jr., known as the 'Iceman,' was born on December 8, 1939, in Sunflower, Mississippi, and raised in Chicago, Illinois. He began his musical journey singing in church choirs and a gospel quartet called the Northern Jubilee Gospel Singers alongside Curtis Mayfield as a teenager. Inspired by Sam Cooke, the Soul Stirrers, the Five Blind Boys of Mississippi, and the Pilgrim Travelers, Butler and Mayfield formed the Roosters, which evolved into the Impressions, signing with Vee-Jay Records and releasing the gold hit 'For Your Precious Love' in 1958.[1]

After leaving the Impressions in 1960, Butler launched a prolific solo career, achieving over 55 Billboard Pop and R&B chart hits, including 'He Will Break Your Heart' (co-written with Mayfield), 'Let It Be Me,' and the million-selling 'Only the Strong Survive.' His soulful style blended smooth ballads and uptempo tracks, often collaborating with Mayfield on early hits and later with the Philadelphia songwriting team Gamble and Huff on albums like *The Ice Man Cometh* (1968) and *Ice on Ice* (1969). He also co-wrote Otis Redding's 'I've Been Loving You Too Long' in 1965 and produced Motown albums in the 1970s.[1]

Beyond music, Butler served as a Cook County Commissioner in Illinois from 1985 to 2018, chairing health committees, and hosted PBS specials like *Doo Wop 50*. Inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame with the Impressions in 1991 and the National Rhythm & Blues Hall of Fame in 2015, he released *Time & Faith* in 1992. Butler died on February 20, 2025, at age 85 from Parkinson's disease complications in Chicago.[1]
