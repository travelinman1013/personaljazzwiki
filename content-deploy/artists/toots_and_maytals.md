## Biography
Toots and the Maytals, founded by Frederick 'Toots' Hibbert in the early 1960s in Kingston, Jamaica, are celebrated as one of the most influential groups in the history of reggae and ska. Hibbert, born in May Pen, Clarendon Parish in 1942, grew up singing gospel in church before moving to Kingston as a teenager, where he met Henry 'Raleigh' Gordon and Nathaniel 'Jerry' Mathias. Together, they formed The Maytals, initially recording for producer Clement 'Coxsone' Dodd at Studio One, with their gospel-infused harmonies quickly distinguishing them in Jamaica’s burgeoning ska scene. Their early years saw collaborations with legendary backing bands like The Skatalites and producers such as Prince Buster and Byron Lee, leading to hits like 'Bam Bam' and a win at the inaugural Jamaica Festival Song Competition in 1966.

The group’s trajectory was briefly interrupted when Hibbert was imprisoned on a controversial drug charge in 1966, an experience that inspired the classic song '54-46 Was My Number.' Upon his release, the group rebranded as Toots and the Maytals and began working with producer Leslie Kong, resulting in international hits such as 'Pressure Drop,' 'Monkey Man,' and 'Do the Reggay'—the latter widely credited with coining the term 'reggae.' Their energetic blend of gospel, soul, ska, and reggae, paired with Hibbert’s powerful, soulful vocals (often compared to Otis Redding), helped define the sound of Jamaican music in the 1960s and 1970s. The band’s music reached global audiences through the soundtrack of the film 'The Harder They Come' and albums like 'Funky Kingston' and 'Reggae Got Soul.'

Toots and the Maytals’ legacy is immense: they are recognized as reggae pioneers alongside Bob Marley, credited with shaping the genre’s sound and spirit. Their influence extends across decades and genres, inspiring countless musicians worldwide and leaving an indelible mark on popular music. Hibbert continued to perform and record until his death in 2020, cementing the group’s place as icons of Jamaican music.
