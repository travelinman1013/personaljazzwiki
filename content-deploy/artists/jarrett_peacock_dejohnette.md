## Biography
Jarrett/Peacock/DeJohnette, often referred to as the 'Standards Trio,' was a groundbreaking jazz piano trio formed by pianist Keith Jarrett, bassist Gary Peacock, and drummer Jack DeJohnette. The group first recorded together in 1977 for Peacock's album 'Tales of Another,' but their formal collaboration began in 1983 when Jarrett, inspired to revisit the Great American Songbook, invited Peacock and DeJohnette to record what became the seminal 'Standards, Vol. 1.' This marked the beginning of a 31-year partnership that would redefine the jazz trio format[2][3][5][7].

The trio's approach was revolutionary in its democratic interplay: each member contributed equally to the music's direction, often described as a musical conversation where roles were fluid and improvisation was paramount. Their repertoire focused on jazz standards, but their interpretations were deeply personal, blending tradition with spontaneous invention. Over three decades, they released more than 20 albums and became renowned for their telepathic communication and emotional depth, performing together until 2014. Their legacy is widely regarded as one of the most influential in modern jazz, setting new standards for ensemble interaction and the art of the jazz standard[3][6].
