## Biography
Oluwabukunmi Ariyibi Peter, professionally known as Kunmie, is a Nigerian Afrobeat singer and songwriter from the Itsekiri ethnic group in the Niger Delta region, raised in a Christian household in Ajegunle, Lagos. He began playing drums at age eight in church, attended Tolu Primary School and Mayday Secondary School, and initially worked as a songwriter for other artists before pursuing his own music. His breakthrough came in 2025 with the viral single 'Arike,' inspired by personal heartbreak and illness, which peaked at No. 2 on Spotify’s Global Viral 50 and amassed millions of streams, propelled by TikTok.[1][2][4]

Kunmie's debut EP, 'Before We Became Strangers' (2025), features four tracks including 'Arike,' 'I Admit,' 'Majekaja,' and 'One More Chance,' blending Afrobeats with soulful introspection in what critics call 'Afro-depression'—drawing comparisons to Fireboy DML but rooted in Ajegunle street rhythms. A pivotal 2023 studio encounter with producer The Kazez encouraged him to record independently using FL Studio. He performed 'Arike' at the 2025 AMVCA, went viral internationally in Uganda, and released a remix of 'Arike' featuring Simi and Mabel in July 2025, expanding his global reach on Apple Music and Spotify.[1][2]

At 21, Kunmie represents the new Ajegunle sound, channeling personal struggles like family challenges into symbolic artistry. His music emphasizes emotional honesty, metaphors, and storytelling, positioning him as a rising voice in Afrobeats with themes of love, regret, and renewal.[1][4]
