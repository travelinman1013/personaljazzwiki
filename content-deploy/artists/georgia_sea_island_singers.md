## Biography
The Georgia Sea Island Singers originated on St. Simons Island, Georgia, in the early 1920s when amateur folklorist Lydia Parrish organized the Spiritual Singers Society of Coastal Georgia to perform Gullah spirituals, songs, stories, dances, and games for guests at the Cloister Hotel. Composed of African American descendants of enslaved people from families like Armstrong, Davis, Ramsey, Morrison, and Proctor, the group preserved the isolated cultural traditions of the Georgia Sea Islands. Bessie Jones, a key figure from Dawson, Georgia, joined in 1933, enriching their repertoire with songs from the slavery era.[1][2][4]

Folklorist Alan Lomax first encountered the group in 1935 with Zora Neale Hurston and Mary Elizabeth Barnicle, recording them for the Library of Congress. He returned in 1959-1960, facilitating their national tours under the new name Georgia Sea Island Singers, with core members including Bessie Jones, Big John Davis, Peter Davis, Henry Morrison, Emma Ramsey, and Mable Hillery. Tensions with Parrish's control led to this offshoot. Douglas Quimby joined in 1969 after singing gospel, later bringing his wife Frankie Sullivan Quimby; Tony Merrell joined in 2001, continuing performances of traditional folk ring shouts and shouts.[1][2][3][5]

The group's career spans decades, performing for U.S. presidents (Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush), at the Smithsonian Folklife Festival, 1994 Olympics, and 2004 G8 Summit. They received the 1990 Governor’s Award in the Humanities. Their style features a cappella Gullah spirituals, ring shouts, and call-and-response singing, documented in Lydia Parrish's 1942 book Slave Songs of the Georgia Sea Islands and Lomax's Southern Journey recordings, leaving a lasting legacy in preserving Gullah Geechee culture.[1][2][3]
