## Biography
Betty Carter (born Lillie Mae Jones, May 16, 1929 – September 26, 1998) was an American jazz singer renowned for her daring improvisational technique, inventive scatting, and complex musical phrasing. Raised in Detroit, Michigan, Carter began studying piano at the Detroit Conservatory of Music at age 15, but soon gravitated toward singing, sneaking out as a teenager to perform in local jazz clubs. Her early exposure to jazz greats passing through Detroit, and a formative opportunity to sit in with Charlie Parker, shaped her musical ambitions and style.

Carter’s professional breakthrough came in 1948 when she joined Lionel Hampton’s band, where her penchant for bebop improvisation earned her the nickname "Betty Bebop." After leaving Hampton, she collaborated with jazz luminaries such as Miles Davis, Ray Charles, and Sonny Rollins, and became known for her fearless, unpredictable approach to melody and rhythm. Frustrated by the constraints of major record labels, Carter founded her own label, Bet-Car Productions, in 1971, asserting creative control and paving the way for other artists to do the same. Her landmark albums, including "The Audience with Betty Carter" (1979) and the Grammy-winning "Look What I Got!" (1988), solidified her reputation as one of jazz’s most innovative vocalists.

Carter was also a passionate mentor, founding the Jazz Ahead program in 1993 to nurture young jazz musicians. She continued to perform and teach until her death in 1998, leaving a legacy as both an uncompromising artist and a champion for the next generation of jazz talent.
