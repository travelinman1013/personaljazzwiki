## Biography
Fieldwork is a critically acclaimed jazz collective formed in New York City in the early 2000s, originally featuring pianist Vijay Iyer, saxophonist Aaron Stewart, and drummer Elliot Humberto Kavee. The group quickly became known for its innovative, bassless trio format and its intense focus on rhythm, complex structures, and collective improvisation. Their debut album, 'Your Life Flashes' (2002), showcased a distinctive blend of intricate, highly rhythmic compositions and avant-garde sensibilities, drawing from the M-Base school and the broader American jazz tradition.

After some personnel changes, Fieldwork reached its most celebrated lineup with Vijay Iyer (piano), Steve Lehman (alto saxophone), and Tyshawn Sorey (drums) by 2005. This iteration pushed the group's sound further, incorporating influences from modern composition, African and South Asian music, underground hip-hop, electronica, and the experimental ethos of Chicago’s AACM collective. Their albums 'Simulated Progress' (2005) and 'Door' (2008) received widespread acclaim for their dense, visceral, and tightly unified sound, marked by a communal approach to composition and rehearsal. Fieldwork's legacy lies in its rigorous, forward-thinking approach to jazz, influencing a new generation of improvisers and composers.

Fieldwork is recognized for its collective ethos, with all members contributing compositions and arrangements. The group’s music is characterized by its challenging rhythmic interplay, angular melodies, and a mysterious inner logic that is both intellectually demanding and accessible. Their work has been praised for its innovation, energy, and the profound sense of trust and communication among its members.
