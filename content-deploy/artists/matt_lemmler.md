## Biography
Matt Lemmler is a New Orleans–born pianist, vocalist, composer, arranger, educator, producer, and Steinway Artist regarded as one of the more original jazz voices to emerge from the city’s rich piano tradition.[1][2] Raised in the Lower 9th Ward just blocks from the home of rhythm-and-blues legend Fats Domino, he grew up in a deeply musical household where his father, Richard Lemmler Sr., a retired professional musician, and his brothers Richard Jr. and Michael (also a noted New Orleans pianist-bandleader), kept jazz and classical piano sounding through the house around the clock.[2] He went on to earn a Bachelor of Music degree from Loyola University New Orleans and a Master of Music from the Manhattan School of Music in New York, where his arrangements, compositions, and piano work were showcased in a debut performance at Carnegie Hall.[1][2] 

After completing his studies, Lemmler spent four years touring internationally with Andrew Lloyd Webber’s musical "The Phantom of the Opera" before returning to New Orleans to refine his craft with leading local bandleaders such as Bob French and the Original Tuxedo Jazz Band, Herb Tassin and the Blue Room Orchestra, and master clarinetist Pete Fountain.[1][2] In the 2000s he began recording under his own name, forming the New Orleans Jazz Revival Band and releasing albums including "Portraits of Wonder" (a New Orleans jazz tribute to Stevie Wonder), "The Music of New Orleans" (a tribute to his hometown), and "UBUNTU," a spiritually oriented collection of reimagined church hymns, American spirituals, and classic 1970s pop, as well as later projects like "Love," which pays homage to Billy Joel, the Lennon–McCartney songbook, and Lionel Richie.[1][2][3] His work, steeped in the legacy of New Orleans pianists from Jelly Roll Morton and Fats Domino to James Booker, Dr. John, Ellis Marsalis, and Harry Connick Jr., blends stride- and gospel-infused jazz piano with soul and pop sensibilities, often emphasizing healing, spirituality, and community—an outlook captured in his embrace of the concept of “Ubuntu,” the idea that the collective is stronger than the individual.[1][3] 

Beyond performance and recording, Lemmler has built an extensive career in education and musical direction. He serves as a jazz piano professor in the Jazz Studies program at Loyola University New Orleans and musical director for the New Orleans Jazz Revival Band, and has been active in broader industry leadership, including service as a GRAMMY Governor for the Memphis regional chapter from 2011 to 2013.[1][6][7] His projects have taken him far beyond New Orleans, from solo concerts in Moscow for the city’s 866th birthday celebration to commissions such as "Southern Songs & Sonatas" for the Ogden Museum of Southern Art’s 10th anniversary, and into television work where he has acted in and composed music for HBO’s "Treme" and AMC’s "Preacher."[1][3][7] Through this combination of performance, teaching, and composition, Lemmler positions himself as a contemporary bearer of New Orleans’ piano lineage while extending it into fresh, genre-crossing territory aimed at both honoring tradition and offering what he describes as an inspirational experience for mind, body, and spirit.[1][2][3]
