## Biography
Alanis Morissette was born in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, and began her musical journey early, learning piano at age four or six, guitar later, and writing her first songs by age eight or nine. She acted in the children's TV show You Can't Do That on Television in 1986, using earnings to release her debut single 'Fate Stay with Me.' At age 10, she formed a band named after herself, and by 14, she signed a publishing deal leading to two dance-pop albums on MCA Records: Alanis (1991), which went platinum in Canada, and Now Is the Time (1992).[1][2][3][5]

After high school graduation around 1993, Morissette moved from Ottawa to Toronto, then Los Angeles, seeking new collaborators. There, she partnered with producer Glen Ballard, shifting from dance-pop to alternative rock with confessional, emotionally raw lyrics delivered in her signature mezzo-soprano voice. Their collaboration yielded Jagged Little Pill (1995) on Maverick Records, which sold over 30 million copies worldwide, becoming one of the best-selling albums ever, with hits like 'You Oughta Know' and 'Ironic.' The album earned her five Grammy Awards in 1996, including Album of the Year.[1][4][5][6]

Subsequent albums like Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie (1998), Under Rug Swept (2002), and So-Called Chaos (2004) saw her take on producing duties, evolving her style while maintaining introspective themes. Morissette has also acted in TV shows, theater like The Vagina Monologues, and composed for the Jagged Little Pill musical in 2018. Her legacy includes pioneering female-driven alternative rock and influencing confessional songwriting.[1][2][6]
