## Biography
Muggsy Spanier, born Francis Joseph Julian Spanier on November 9, 1901 (some sources cite 1906), in Chicago, Illinois, was a pioneering American jazz cornetist whose career helped shape the sound of traditional jazz and swing. Growing up in Chicago, Spanier began playing the cornet at age 13 and was soon swept up in the city’s vibrant jazz scene. He became associated with the Austin High Gang, a group of young white musicians who were instrumental in popularizing jazz in Chicago during the 1920s.

Spanier’s career blossomed as he played with prominent bands and musicians, including stints with the Coon-Sanders Orchestra and Ted Lewis. His most influential work came in 1939 with the formation of 'Muggsy Spanier and His Ragtime Band,' whose recordings, known as the 'Great 16,' became a blueprint for the Dixieland revival. Spanier’s robust, lyrical cornet style was deeply influenced by early New Orleans jazz, especially King Oliver, and he became known for his expressive phrasing and driving rhythm. He continued to perform and record through the swing era and into the 1950s and 1960s, leaving a lasting legacy as a bridge between early jazz and later traditional jazz revivals.

Spanier’s dedication to classic jazz forms and his collaborations with a wide range of musicians cemented his reputation as a key figure in American jazz history. His influence extended beyond his own recordings, inspiring generations of jazz musicians to embrace the roots of the genre while bringing their own voices to the tradition.
