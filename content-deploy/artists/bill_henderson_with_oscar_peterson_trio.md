## Biography
Bill Henderson, born in Chicago, Illinois, in 1926, began performing as a singer and dancer at the age of four. After serving in the Army during World War II, he returned to Chicago and established himself in the local jazz scene, performing with the Ramsey Lewis Trio and gaining recognition for his rich, expressive voice. His big break came in 1958 when he recorded a vocal version of Horace Silver’s 'Señor Blues' for Blue Note Records, which became one of the label’s top-selling singles and cemented his reputation as a leading jazz vocalist.

Throughout the late 1950s and 1960s, Henderson recorded for Vee-Jay Records and collaborated with some of the most prominent names in jazz, including Oscar Peterson, with whom he recorded the acclaimed 1963 album 'Bill Henderson with the Oscar Peterson Trio.' This album, featuring Oscar Peterson (piano), Ray Brown (bass), and Ed Thigpen (drums), is considered a classic of vocal jazz. Henderson also worked with Art Blakey, Count Basie, and Jimmy Smith, and performed at major venues and festivals such as the Playboy Jazz Festival, Monterey Jazz Festival, and Lincoln Center. In addition to his musical career, Henderson became a successful actor, appearing in numerous television shows and films while continuing to perform and record jazz into his later years.

Henderson’s musical style blended blues, ballads, and swing, drawing comparisons to Joe Williams and Ernie Andrews but always marked by his own distinctive personality and interpretive depth. His legacy endures through his influential recordings and his impact on generations of jazz vocalists, as well as his contributions to both music and acting.
