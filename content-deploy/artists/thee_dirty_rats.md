## Biography
Thee Dirty Rats is a garage punk duo originating from São Paulo, Brazil, consisting of Rat Caesar on cigar-box guitar and vocals, and Fernando Hitman on drums and vocals.[2][3] Also identified as featuring Luis Tissot among the trash-loving rockers, the band embodies a raw, garage rock style aligned with their Spotify genre classification.[5] Limited details exist on their early formation, but they have released music such as the EP 'The Fine Art of Poisoning 1 & 2' and tracks like 'Who's The Man Behind The Rat' and 'Bacterial Bop,' showcasing their punk energy.[2][3][5]

The duo's career centers on producing gritty, garage punk music with a focus on unconventional instrumentation like cigar-box guitar, contributing to their niche presence in the international underground scene.[2][5] No extensive records of tours, major releases, or career milestones beyond Bandcamp outputs are available from credible sources, reflecting their low popularity (0 on Spotify).[context] Their style draws from trash rock influences, positioning them within Brazil's garage punk community.[5]

Thee Dirty Rats' legacy remains emerging due to sparse documentation, with no notable awards, widespread recognition, or long-term impact identified; they persist as a dedicated duo in the DIY garage punk realm.[2][3][5]
