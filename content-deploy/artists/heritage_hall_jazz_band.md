## Biography
The Preservation Hall Jazz Band originated from Preservation Hall, a legendary music venue in New Orleans' French Quarter founded in 1961 by Allan and Sandra Jaffe. In the 1950s, art dealer Larry Borenstein ran the space as a gallery and invited local jazz musicians to perform, drawing visitors including the Jaffes during their 1961 honeymoon. Allan Jaffe, a tuba player from Pennsylvania with a Wharton School background, and his wife took over management, hiring elderly New Orleans jazz masters aged 60s to 90s who faced poverty and hardship. The venue offered unamplified, alcohol-free performances without advertising, reviving traditional New Orleans jazz amid the rise of rock and bebop.[1][3][5]

The band formed in 1963 as the touring arm of Preservation Hall's house band, spreading New Orleans jazz worldwide with leaders like Sweet Emma Barrett, Kid Thomas Valentine, Percy and Willie Humphrey, De De and Billie Pierce, and clarinetist George Lewis. Early members had connections to jazz pioneers such as Buddy Bolden, Jelly Roll Morton, Louis Armstrong, and Bunk Johnson. After Allan Jaffe's death, his son Ben Jaffe assumed leadership as creative director, playing tuba and bass while maintaining the band's rotating lineup and global tours, even continuing post-Hurricane Katrina in 2005.[1][2][4][5]

The band's musical style embodies traditional New Orleans jazz—characterized by brass, collective improvisation, and joyful rhythms—while evolving with younger musicians. Its legacy lies in preserving this art form, nurturing generations of players, and influencing global audiences through performances at Carnegie Hall, for royalty, and via recordings, ensuring the music's timeless spirit endures.[1][3][6]
