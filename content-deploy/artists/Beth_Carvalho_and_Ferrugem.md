## Biography
Beth Carvalho (1946–2019) was a seminal Brazilian samba singer, guitarist, cavaquinist, and composer, celebrated as one of the most influential figures in the history of samba and pagode. Raised in a middle-class family in Rio de Janeiro, Carvalho was exposed to music from an early age—her father took her to samba school rehearsals, while her mother encouraged her interest in classical music. As a teenager, she began playing guitar and became involved in the Bossa Nova movement, winning a national TV song contest at 19. However, she soon shifted her focus to samba, releasing her first solo album, 'Andança,' in 1968, which brought her national attention.[1][3]

Throughout her career, Carvalho was known for championing the work of both legendary and emerging samba composers, including Cartola, Nelson Cavaquinho, Guilherme de Brito, and Nelson Sargento. She played a pivotal role in modernizing samba in the 1980s while preserving its traditions, and was instrumental in popularizing the pagode style. Her efforts earned her the title 'madrinha do samba' (the godmother of samba), as she consistently sought to give visibility to underrated artists and composers. Over a career spanning more than 40 years, Carvalho released numerous albums, collaborated with many samba greats, and became a cultural icon in Brazil, recognized for her substantial contributions to the genre and her advocacy for social causes.[1][2][3][4]

Beth Carvalho's legacy endures not only through her extensive discography but also through the artists she mentored and inspired. She is remembered for her exuberant performances, her dedication to the samba community, and her role in bringing samba to new audiences both in Brazil and internationally. Her music, which often addressed the struggles of the poor and Indigenous peoples, remains a touchstone in Brazilian culture.[1][3][4]
