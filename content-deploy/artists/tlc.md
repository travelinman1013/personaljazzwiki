## Biography
TLC is an American R&B and hip‑hop girl group formed in 1990 in Atlanta, Georgia, best known in its classic lineup of Tionne “T‑Boz” Watkins, Lisa “Left Eye” Lopes, and Rozonda “Chilli” Thomas.[5][1] The group initially began when producer Ian Burke and teenager Crystal Jones conceived a tomboyish girl group, 2nd Nature, with Jones, Watkins, and Lopes working on demos with producers Jermaine Dupri and Rico Wade before attracting the attention of singer‑manager Perri “Pebbles” Reid and LaFace Records executives Antonio “L.A.” Reid and Kenneth “Babyface” Edmonds.[5] After LaFace insisted on replacing Jones, Rozonda Thomas was added in 1991, and the trio took on the nicknames T‑Boz, Left Eye, and Chilli to preserve the acronym TLC as they signed to LaFace and Arista.[5] Their 1992 debut album *Ooooooohhh… On the TLC Tip* blended new jack swing, R&B, and rap with bright, condom‑themed fashion and playful, female‑empowering lyrics, quickly establishing them as one of the defining young acts of early‑1990s urban pop.[5][3]

TLC reached superstar status with their second album *CrazySexyCool* (1994) and its socially conscious, genre‑blending hits like “Creep” and “Waterfalls,” followed by *FanMail* (1999) and smash singles “No Scrubs” and “Unpretty,” ultimately scoring nine Top 10 hits and four No. 1 singles on the Billboard Hot 100 while becoming the best‑selling American girl group with over 65–85 million records sold worldwide.[5][1][6] Their music fused contemporary R&B, hip‑hop, pop, and soul, distinguished by T‑Boz’s husky contralto lead vocals, Chilli’s smooth mezzo‑soprano harmonies, and Left Eye’s agile, often socially aware rap verses, underpinned by producers such as Dallas Austin and Babyface and a strong emphasis on themes of female empowerment, safe sex, self‑respect, and social issues.[5] Despite commercial success, the group faced financial struggles and a widely publicized 1995 bankruptcy, as well as internal tensions and Lisa Lopes’s 2002 death in a car accident in Honduras; T‑Boz and Chilli chose not to replace her, continuing as a duo, releasing the album *3D* (2002) with Lopes’s posthumous contributions and later issuing their self‑titled album *TLC* in 2017.[5][3][1] Over time, their influence has been recognized through multiple Grammy Awards, MTV Video Music Awards, Soul Train Awards, and honors such as the Outstanding Contribution to Music award at the MOBO Awards and a Legend Award in Japan, cementing their legacy as pioneers of 1990s R&B and hip‑hop girl‑group artistry.[1][5]

TLC’s legacy extends beyond chart success: they helped open commercial and creative doors for later R&B girl groups, normalized a candid discussion of sexuality, health, and self‑image in mainstream pop, and brought a distinct Afrocentric, street‑meets‑high‑fashion visual identity to MTV at a time when hip‑hop‑influenced girl groups were rare on that platform.[3][5] Even after Lopes’s passing, T‑Boz and Chilli have kept the catalog alive through touring, reality television ventures like *R U the Girl?*, and documentary projects, while continuing to emphasize that TLC remains a group built on friendship, individuality, and advocacy for women’s autonomy in both music and life.[4][3]

## Fun Facts
- The name TLC originally stood for the first names of the founding members Tionne, Lisa, and Crystal; when Crystal Jones left and Rozonda Thomas joined, the group kept the acronym by giving the members the nicknames T‑Boz, Left Eye, and Chilli so that their stage names still spelled TLC.[5][6]
- In their early years, TLC’s signature look included brightly colored outfits accessorized with condoms sewn onto their clothes—with Lisa "Left Eye" Lopes famously wearing one over her left eye in her glasses—to promote safe sex and HIV/AIDS awareness in a playful but visible way.[5]
- Despite being multi‑platinum stars, TLC famously filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1995, citing a combination of recording and management contracts, expenses, and debts that left them with relatively little income compared to their massive sales.[5]
- TLC is widely recognized as the best‑selling American girl group of all time, with estimates of more than 65–85 million records sold worldwide and a catalog that includes multiple Grammy‑winning albums and several multiplatinum releases.[2][6][1]
