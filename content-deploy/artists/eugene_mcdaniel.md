## Biography
Eugene Booker McDaniels (February 12, 1935 – July 29, 2011) was born in Kansas City, Kansas, and raised in Omaha, Nebraska, where he was exposed to music from an early age through his father's church ministry. He studied at the Omaha Conservatory of Music and developed proficiency in saxophone and trumpet while cultivating a deep appreciation for jazz. In his teens, he formed a gospel singing group called the Echoes of Joy (later known as the Sultans) and went on to study at the University of Omaha Conservatory of Music before joining the Mississippi Piney Woods Singers, with whom he toured in California.[1]

McDaniels achieved his greatest commercial success in the early 1960s as a suave pop-R&B vocalist signed to Liberty Records. Working with producer Snuff Garrett, he scored major hits with "A Hundred Pounds of Clay" (which reached number 3 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1961 and earned gold status) and "Tower of Strength" (number 5, co-written by Burt Bacharach), establishing himself as a mainstream pop artist during an era when music by Black artists was often relegated to "race music" categories.[1][3] However, his chart success waned as British acts like The Beatles dominated popular music in the mid-1960s, prompting McDaniels to pivot toward songwriting.

In the late 1960s, McDaniels underwent a dramatic artistic transformation, reclaiming his full name and embracing a socially conscious direction that would define his legacy. His songwriting breakthrough came with "Compared to What," recorded live by Les McCann and Eddie Harris at the Montreux Jazz Festival in 1969, which became an anthem for the anti-war movement and is now considered one of the fifty most important protest songs of the last fifty years.[3] This period culminated in his provocative early 1970s albums *The Outlaw* (1970) and *Headless Heroes of the Apocalypse*, which featured folk-funk instrumentation and fearless social commentary on colonialism, racism, and injustice. The latter album was so politically charged that Vice President Spiro Agnew personally called Atlantic Records requesting its removal from circulation.[3] McDaniels' songwriting prowess earned him a lasting partnership with Roberta Flack, who recorded over 18 of his compositions, including the massive hit "Feel Like Makin' Love," which has been covered over 400 times and helped define 1970s R&B.[3]

## Fun Facts
- McDaniels' album *Headless Heroes of the Apocalypse* was so politically provocative that Vice President Spiro Agnew personally called Atlantic Records' executives requesting the album be pulled from circulation, making it a rare example of direct government censorship pressure during the Nixon administration.[3]
- The album *Headless Heroes of the Apocalypse* featured "Supermarket Blues", a proto-hip hop track where McDaniels rapped over a staccato beat about a confrontation with law enforcement over a can of peas—decades before hip-hop became mainstream, and later sampled by numerous hip-hop pioneers.[3]
- McDaniels' composition "Compared to What" has been recorded hundreds of times and is considered one of the fifty most important protest songs of the last fifty years, yet it was originally recorded live by other artists (Les McCann and Eddie Harris) at the Montreux Jazz Festival rather than by McDaniels himself.[3]
- After his initial pop success faded in the mid-1960s, McDaniels left the United States in 1968 following the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to live in Denmark and Sweden, where he concentrated on songwriting and eventually developed his revolutionary artistic vision.[1]
