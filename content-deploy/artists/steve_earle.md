## Biography
Steve Earle was born on January 17, 1955, at the Army hospital in Fort Monroe, Virginia, and grew up in Texas, where he received his first guitar at age 11 and became proficient by 13. He dropped out of school in the 9th grade, left home as a teenager to live with an uncle in Houston, and moved to Nashville in 1974 at age 19, working blue-collar jobs by day while playing music at night and establishing himself as a songwriter. There, he forged close relationships with musical idols Guy Clark and Townes Van Zandt, played bass in Clark's backing band, and appeared on Clark's 1975 album Old No. 1, while also working as a staff songwriter.[2][3][5][6][7]

Earle's breakthrough came with his 1986 debut album Guitar Town on MCA Records, which topped the country charts with hits like the title track and 'Goodbye's All We've Got Left,' blending country, rock, and rockabilly in what became a cornerstone of the Americana genre. His career saw highs with subsequent albums like Copperhead Road (1988) and lows including addiction struggles, but he staged comebacks with E-Squared Records releases such as I Feel Alright (1996) and Grammy-winning albums including The Revolution Starts...Now (2004), Washington Square Serenade (2007), and Townes (2009). Known for his gritty, outlaw style across alt country, americana, and country rock, Earle has released over 21 studio albums, earned three Grammys for Best Contemporary Folk Album, and expanded into acting (roles in The Wire and Treme), writing (novel I'll Never Get Out of This World Alive, 2011), and theater music (Ghosts of West Virginia, 2020).[1][2][3][4]

Earle's legacy endures as an influential songwriter inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2020, with Copperhead Road named an official Tennessee state song in 2023; tributes like Guy (2019) to Clark and Jerry Jeff (2022) to Jerry Jeff Walker highlight his roots, while recent works like J.T. (2021) reflect his ongoing evolution and political engagement.[2][3][4]
