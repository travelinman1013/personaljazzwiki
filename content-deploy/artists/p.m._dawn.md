## Biography
P.M. Dawn was an American hip hop act formed in 1988 in Jersey City, New Jersey, by brothers Attrell Cordes (known as Prince Be) and Jarrett Cordes (DJ Minutemix). Raised by their mother and stepfather George Brown—a founding member of Kool & The Gang—the Cordes brothers developed a unique musical style that blended hip hop, soul, and pop-oriented urban R&B. Their debut album, Of the Heart, of the Soul and of the Cross: The Utopian Experience (1991), brought them international acclaim, highlighted by the chart-topping single 'Set Adrift on Memory Bliss,' which sampled Spandau Ballet's 'True' and became the first #1 song on the Billboard Hot 100 after the introduction of Nielsen SoundScan. The group's subsequent albums, including The Bliss Album…? (1993), continued to receive critical praise, with hits like 'I'd Die Without You' and 'Looking Through Patient Eyes.' Despite declining commercial success in later years, P.M. Dawn remained influential for their innovative sound and introspective lyrics. Prince Be's health struggles led to his departure in 2005, and he passed away in 2016. The group continued with new members until 2018, leaving a legacy as pioneers of alternative hip hop and crossover pop.
