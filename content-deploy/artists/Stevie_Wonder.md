## Biography
Stevie Wonder, born Stevland Hardaway Judkins on May 13, 1950, in Saginaw, Michigan, is one of the most influential and innovative musicians of the late 20th century. Blind shortly after birth due to retinopathy of prematurity, Wonder moved with his family to Detroit at age four, where he quickly demonstrated prodigious musical talent. By age eight, he was already a skilled musician, teaching himself harmonica, piano, and drums, and singing in his local church choir. His early exposure to jazz, R&B, and artists like B.B. King deeply shaped his musical sensibilities.[1][2][3][4][5]

Discovered at age 11 by Ronnie White of The Miracles, Wonder auditioned for Motown founder Berry Gordy, who signed him to the label and dubbed him 'Little Stevie Wonder.' His debut recordings showcased his virtuosity on multiple instruments, but it was the live single 'Fingertips, Pt. 2' that catapulted him to national fame at just 13, making him the youngest artist to top the Billboard Hot 100.[2][3][5] As he matured, Wonder dropped the 'Little' from his name and developed a distinctive sound blending soul, Motown, funk, and pop. The 1970s marked his creative peak, with groundbreaking albums like 'Talking Book,' 'Innervisions,' and 'Songs in the Key of Life,' featuring hits such as 'Superstition,' 'You Are the Sunshine of My Life,' and 'Sir Duke.'[2][3][6]

Wonder's legacy is defined by his technical innovation, social consciousness, and genre-defying artistry. He pioneered the use of synthesizers in popular music and was a driving force in bringing socially relevant themes to mainstream audiences. His influence extends across generations and genres, cementing his status as a musical icon and a key architect of modern soul and pop music.[2][3][6]
