## Biography
Big Shanty is an American blues-rock musician known for his innovative fusion of traditional Delta blues with modern electronic elements, creating a sound that blends retro and techno influences. Growing up in Atlanta, Georgia, he was drawn to the blues from an early age, listening to local radio stations and developing a deep connection to the genre by age eight. His early musical journey was marked by experimentation, particularly with guitar tunings, leading him to develop his own unique tuning in 1977, which became a hallmark of his playing style. 

Big Shanty's career gained significant momentum in the mid-2000s, particularly with the release of his anti-war single "Killing Fields," which topped the Blues Critic singles chart for five weeks in 2007. His album "Ride With The Wind" was critically acclaimed, remaining in the top ten of the Blues Critic album chart for five months and earning the distinction of "#1 Blues Album of 2007" by Real Blues Magazine. Known for his energetic live performances and genre-blending approach, Big Shanty has collaborated with a range of notable musicians, including Col. Bruce Hampton and Liz Melendez, and has continued to release powerful collections of both studio and live recordings. His music is often compared to artists like the White Stripes, Jimi Hendrix, and Neil Young, reflecting his eclectic and boundary-pushing style. 

Throughout his career, Big Shanty has remained committed to expressing raw emotion through his music, often drawing inspiration from personal experiences and dreams. His legacy lies in his ability to merge the storytelling tradition of blues with contemporary sounds, making his work resonate with both traditional blues fans and new audiences.
