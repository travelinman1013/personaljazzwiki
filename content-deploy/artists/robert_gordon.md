## Biography
Robert Gordon (March 29, 1947 – October 18, 2022) was an American rockabilly singer born in Washington, D.C., and raised in Bethesda, Maryland. Inspired at age nine by Elvis Presley’s 'Heartbreak Hotel,' Gordon pursued a career in rock and roll, influenced by Gene Vincent, Eddie Cochran, and other pioneers of the genre. He made his recording debut at 17 with the group the Confidentials and later performed with the Newports. In the 1970s, Gordon moved to New York City and became involved in the punk rock scene, notably as the lead vocalist for the band Tuff Darts and appearing in the underground film 'Unmade Beds.' His pivotal career shift came when producer Richard Gottehrer discovered him and encouraged his move into rockabilly, leading to his 1977 debut album 'Robert Gordon With Link Wray.' This record, featuring guitar legend Link Wray, helped ignite the rockabilly revival of the late 1970s and early 1980s. Gordon’s style blended classic rockabilly with elements of psychobilly, boogie-woogie, and rock and roll, earning him a reputation as a torchbearer for the genre. His 1981 hit 'Someday, Someway,' written by Marshall Crenshaw, became his most successful single. Despite being overshadowed by the Stray Cats’ rise, Gordon’s influence on the rockabilly revival was profound, and he continued performing and recording into the 2000s, including tours with all-star lineups and collaborations with notable musicians.
