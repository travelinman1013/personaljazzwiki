## Biography
Henry Robert Merrill Levan, known as Bob Merrill, was born on May 17, 1921, in Atlantic City, New Jersey, and raised in Philadelphia over his family's candy shop. He began his entertainment career as a singer, impressionist, and emcee in burlesque houses and amateur shows before serving in the U.S. Army during World War II. After the war, he moved to Hollywood, working as a dialogue director and later casting director at Columbia Pictures and CBS, where he started composing songs despite being unable to read music or play instruments, using a toy xylophone and a numbering system to notate melodies.[1][2][3][5][6]

Merrill's songwriting career exploded in the 1950s with a string of massive pop hits, including 'If I Knew You Were Comin' I'd've Baked a Cake' (1950), '(How Much Is) That Doggie in the Window?' (1953), 'Mambo Italiano,' 'Honeycomb,' and songs for artists like Guy Mitchell, Patti Page, and Jimmie Rodgers. Transitioning to Broadway, he debuted with New Girl in Town (1957), followed by Take Me Along (1959), Carnival! (1961, for which he won the New York Drama Critics' Circle Award), and his pinnacle collaboration on Funny Girl (1964) with Jule Styne, featuring Barbra Streisand and hits like 'People' and 'Don't Rain on My Parade.' His style blended catchy novelty pop with heartfelt theatrical ballads.[1][2][3][4][6]

Merrill earned five Tony nominations, induction into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1987, and continued writing for TV specials like Mister Magoo's Christmas Carol (1962). Later Broadway attempts like Prettybelle (1971) and The Prince of Grand Street (1978) closed in tryouts, but his legacy as one of the 1950s' most prolific hitmakers endures. He died on February 17, 1998.[1][2][3][4]
