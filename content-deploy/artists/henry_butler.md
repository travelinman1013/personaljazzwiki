## Biography
Henry Butler was born blind in 1948 in New Orleans, Louisiana, and grew up in the Calliope housing projects. He began playing piano at age six and quickly demonstrated prodigious talent, joining the glee club at the Louisiana School for the Blind by age seven and performing professionally by age fourteen[1][2][3]. Butler's early musical education included not only piano but also baritone saxophone, valve trombone, and drums, and he became adept at arranging music for various ensembles[2].

After high school, Butler attended Southern University in Baton Rouge, majoring in voice due to the scarcity of braille scores for piano. There, he came under the mentorship of jazz clarinetist Alvin Batiste, who instilled in him the importance of improvisation and exposed him to a wide spectrum of musical traditions. Butler later earned a master's degree from Michigan State University and studied with renowned pianists Harold Mabern and Roland Hanna[2]. Returning to New Orleans in 1974, Butler immersed himself in the city's vibrant club scene, learning directly from legendary pianists like Professor Longhair and James Booker, and teaching at the New Orleans Center for the Creative Arts[1][2].

Butler's career spanned jazz, blues, R&B, and classical music, earning him acclaim as one of the greatest living New Orleans pianists and a modern link in the city's storied piano tradition[2][3]. He recorded his first album as a leader, "Fivin' Around," in 1986, collaborating with top jazz musicians such as Billy Higgins, Jack DeJohnette, and Ron Carter[2]. Butler performed internationally and at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival over three dozen times, blending influences from Caribbean, classical, pop, and world music into his expressive style. Despite losing his home to Hurricane Katrina, Butler continued to perform, teach, and inspire until his death in 2018[2][3].
