## Biography
Michael Burks, known as the 'Iron Man' of blues, was born on July 30, 1957, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, into a family steeped in musical tradition. His father, Frederick Burks, was a bassist who played with Sonny Boy Williamson II, and his grandfather was a delta blues musician, which gave Michael early exposure to the genre. By age five, Burks was already learning guitar, incentivized by his father's promise of a dollar for every song he mastered. He made his stage debut at six, joining his cousin's band, and later moved with his family to Camden, Arkansas, where he and his father built the Bradley Ferry Country Club, a 300-seat juke joint where Michael led the house band[1][2][5][6][7][8].

After the club closed in the mid-1980s, Burks worked as a mechanical technician at Lockheed Martin while continuing to play local gigs. In 1997, he self-released his debut album, 'From the Inside Out,' which was praised by critics as one of the year's best debut discs. His energetic, passionate performances earned him a reputation as a powerhouse blues guitarist and vocalist, despite critics noting his vocals were gritty rather than polished. Signed by Alligator Records in 2001, Burks released 'Make It Rain,' followed by 'I Smell Smoke' (2003) and 'Iron Man' (2008), the latter named after his nickname. He became a fixture at major blues festivals and was nominated five times for Blues Music Awards, winning the Living Blues Critics' Award for Best Guitarist in 2004[1][2][5][7].

Burks' legacy is marked by his emotionally charged guitar work and soulful blues-rock style, blending electric blues, soul blues, and blues rock. He influenced a new generation of blues musicians and was respected for his dedication to the craft. Burks died suddenly of a heart attack on May 6, 2012, in Atlanta, Georgia, after returning from a European tour. His posthumous album 'Show of Strength' won Blues Music Awards for Contemporary Blues Album and Album of the Year in 2013, cementing his place among modern blues greats[2].
