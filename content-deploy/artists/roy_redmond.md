## Biography
Roy Redmond is a mysterious figure in the world of Northern Soul, best known for his brief but impactful recording career in the late 1960s. Very little is documented about his early life or background, and almost all available information centers on his work with Loma Records, a Warner Bros. subsidiary focused on soul singles. In 1967, Redmond recorded just four songs, released as two singles, including his acclaimed cover of The Beatles' 'Good Day Sunshine' and a powerful rendition of Sam Cooke's 'A Change Is Gonna Come.'[1][2][6][7]

Redmond's music is characterized by its passionate vocal delivery and danceable, uptempo arrangements, which have made his tracks highly sought after by Northern Soul enthusiasts. His single 'Ain't That Terrible' is considered a classic of the genre, praised for its relentless energy and floor-filling appeal. Despite the quality and popularity of his recordings, Redmond disappeared from the music scene after these releases, leaving behind a legacy built on rarity and cult admiration.[1][2][7]

Although his career was short-lived, Roy Redmond's work has been celebrated in Northern Soul circles, especially in the UK, where collectors and DJs continue to champion his singles. The enduring demand for his records and the mystery surrounding his life have only added to his legendary status among soul aficionados.[1][2][7]
