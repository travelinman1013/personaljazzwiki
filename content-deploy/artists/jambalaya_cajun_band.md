## Biography
The Jambalaya Cajun Band is a prominent Cajun and zydeco ensemble that originated in the late 1970s in the Breaux Bridge area of Louisiana. Founded by Terry Huval and his brother Tony Huval, the band quickly became a staple of the regional music scene, known for its authentic Cajun sound and energetic performances. Over the decades, the group has played a vital role in preserving and promoting Cajun culture, performing at major festivals such as Festivals Acadiens et Creole for over 40 years. Their polished sound is a product of their long-standing presence and dedication to the genre, earning them recognition as an 'Up and Coming Band' and second place in the 'Musician du Bar' contest at Acadian Village in 1984.

Musically, the Jambalaya Cajun Band blends traditional Cajun instrumentation—featuring fiddle, accordion, and rhythm section—with zydeco influences, creating a vibrant and danceable sound. Terry Huval, a native speaker of Cajun French, is recognized as one of Cajun music's finest fiddlers and songwriters, contributing significantly to the band's repertoire and style. The group has also paid tribute to legendary Cajun musicians such as Aldus Roger and Lawrence Walker through special performances, further cementing their role as cultural ambassadors of Cajun music.
