## Biography
The Neville Brothers formed in 1977 in New Orleans, Louisiana, bringing together four brothers from one of the city's most legendary musical families: Art (born 1937), Charles (born 1938), Aaron (born 1941), and Cyril (born 1948). Before uniting as a band, each brother had already established successful individual careers that showcased their diverse talents. Art Neville was a founding member and keyboardist for The Meters, one of funk music's most influential groups, while Aaron had scored a number one hit in 1966 with "Tell It Like It Is," showcasing his distinctive falsetto voice. Charles played saxophone for legendary artists including B.B. King and Al Green, though his career was interrupted by a three-year prison term at Angola Penitentiary on marijuana possession charges. Cyril, the youngest brother, also performed with The Meters and later fronted the Soul Machine with Aaron.

The catalyst for their formation as The Neville Brothers came in 1976 through their uncle George "Big Chief Jolly" Landry, who headed the Wild Tchoupitoulas Mardi Gras Indian tribe. Following their mother Amelia's death and her wish to "keep them boys together," the brothers collaborated on the landmark album "Wild Tchoupitoulas" with Uncle Jolly and members of The Meters. This project, produced by Allen Toussaint and released on Island Records, marked a pivotal moment as it incorporated the distinctive chants and rhythms of New Orleans Mardi Gras Indians into their music. They made their official debut as The Neville Brothers at Tipitina's in 1977, joined by nine other musicians from their Thirteenth Ward neighborhood, and released their self-titled debut album on Capitol Records in 1978.

For over three decades, from 1977 to 2013, The Neville Brothers created a unique sound that seamlessly blended R&B, funk, soul, New Orleans jazz, Mardi Gras Indian chants, gospel, and doo-wop. Their music drew heavily from their upbringing surrounded by New Orleans musical legends like Professor Longhair, Fats Domino, and family friend Smiley Lewis, as well as the gospel music from Sunlight Baptist Church and Two Wing Temple. Notable releases included "Fiyo on the Bayou" (1981), which featured Mardi Gras Indian standards and a Louis Armstrong cover, and "Yellow Moon" (1989), produced by Daniel Lanois, which earned them a Grammy for "Healing Chant." Known for their electrifying live performances, including a four-year stint opening for the Grateful Dead in the late 1970s and regular appearances at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, The Neville Brothers secured their reputation as both first-rank showmen and cultural ambassadors for New Orleans music, with their influence extending far beyond their Spotify popularity rating of 40.

## Fun Facts
- Art Neville modeled The Meters after Booker T. and the MG's but added 'some swamp fever of my own,' creating a sound that would become legendary in funk music history.
- Aaron Neville scored a number one hit with 'Tell It Like It Is' in 1966, showcasing one of the finest falsetto voices ever recorded, before The Neville Brothers even formed.
- The brothers learned Mardi Gras Indian chants growing up from their uncle George Landry (Big Chief Jolly), and during their time living in the Calliope housing development, gospel music literally poured into the streets from the nearby Two Wing Temple, where Elder Utah Smith would plug his electric guitar into an amplifier with an extra-long cord and play outside when the spirit moved him.
- All four brothers hailed from the Thirteenth Ward of New Orleans, specifically Valence Street, which they paid tribute to with their 1999 album 'Valence Street' released on Columbia Records.
