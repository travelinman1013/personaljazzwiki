## Biography
Andreia Dias (sometimes credited as Andréia Dias) is a Brazilian singer, songwriter, and composer associated with São Paulo’s vibrant alternative music scene. Born on 2 March 1973, sources differ on whether her birthplace is the city of São Paulo or the coastal city of Santos, though other profiles describe her as coming from the poor neighborhood of Grajaú on the outskirts of São Paulo.[1][3][4] Raised in an evangelical family, she came into conflict with her parents over her desire to go out at night to rock shows, and at age 17 she ran away from home to pursue her own artistic path.[1][5] She later formalized her training by studying popular singing at the Universidade Livre de Música Tom Jobim, graduating in 1994, which grounded her experimental approach in solid vocal technique and Brazilian popular music traditions.[1]

Through the 1990s and 2000s, Dias became a key figure in cutting‑edge São Paulo collectives that blended samba, rock, MPB, and avant‑garde experimentation. She was part of the first lineup of the group Farofa Carioca, known for its mix of samba‑funk, pop, and socially conscious lyrics.[1] In 2001 she co‑founded the band DonaZica with Iara Rennó and Anelis Assumpção, recording the albums "Composição" (2003) and "Filme Brasileiro" (2005), works associated with the so‑called pós‑vanguarda paulista (post‑vanguard of São Paulo).[1] From 2003 she also joined Banda Glória, with whom she recorded "Passarinho" (2005) and "Banda Glória convida Cristina Buarque" (2008), deepening her links to samba and choro traditions through collaborations with figures like Cristina Buarque.[1]

Dias launched her solo career in 2008 with the album "Vol. 1," produced by drummer Guilherme Kastrup and featuring members of Banda Glória; she described this record as the beginning of a personal "Trilogia da minha cabeça" (“Trilogy of my head”).[1][3][4] The follow‑up "Vol. 2" appeared in 2010 on the independent label Scubidu Records, produced by Ricardo Prado and featuring guest appearances by Iara Rennó and Luque Barros, while "Pelos Trópicos" (2013) emerged from a research and travel project through ten Brazilian capitals, absorbing diverse regional sounds.[1] In 2015 she released "Prisioneira do Amor," revisiting and reinterpreting ten early‑1970s songs first recorded by Rita Lee, and in 2019 she completed her TPMramental trilogy with "Vol. 3," combining her own compositions with a musical setting of a poem by Mário Quintana.[1] Parallel to her solo work she has been closely associated with the legendary experimentalist Tom Zé, joining his band in 2017, singing on his album "Sem Você Não A" and the live/educational project "Estudando Tom Zé" at Sesc Pinheiros, and later contributing vocals to his 2022 album "Língua Brasileira".[1] Through these projects Dias has forged a reputation as a distinctive, avant‑garde voice who bridges samba, MPB, rock, and poetic experimentation in contemporary Brazilian music.[1][3][4]

## Fun Facts
- Dias left home at age 17, running away from her evangelical parents because they would not allow her to go out at night to rock concerts, a decisive act that pushed her fully into a musical life.[1][5]
- She studied popular singing at the Universidade Livre de Música Tom Jobim, graduating in 1994; this formal training underpins her often experimental, avant‑garde vocal approach.[1]
- Her three solo albums titled "Vol. 1," "Vol. 2," and "Vol. 3" form what she herself calls the "Trilogia da minha cabeça" ("Trilogy of my head"), a long‑term conceptual project spanning more than a decade.[1]
- The album "Pelos Trópicos" (2013) came out of a research trip through ten Brazilian capitals, during which she gathered musical impressions and regional influences that she then wove into the record.[1]
