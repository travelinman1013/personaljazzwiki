## Biography
Dee Dee Warwick, born Delia Mae Warrick on September 25, 1942, in Newark, New Jersey, was a celebrated soul singer whose career spanned over four decades[3][4]. She grew up in a deeply musical family: her mother, Lee Drinkard-Warrick, was a founding member of the Drinkard Singers, a renowned gospel group that included her aunt Cissy Houston[2][3]. As a teenager, Dee Dee sang in the New Hope Baptist Church choir alongside her sister Dionne Warwick and Cissy Houston, eventually forming the gospel trio The Gospelaires, which often performed with the Drinkard Singers[2][3][4]. Her early exposure to gospel music profoundly shaped her vocal style, characterized by emotional depth and technical prowess. In 1959, the Warwick sisters made their recording debut as background vocalists at the Apollo Theater, launching a prolific period of session work in New York City throughout the early 1960s[2][3]. Dee Dee began her solo career in 1963, recording for Jubilee and later Mercury Records, where she released hits like 'I Want To Be With You' and 'Foolish Fool'[1][2]. She is also notable for recording the original version of 'You're No Good' (later a hit for Linda Ronstadt) and 'I'm Gonna Make You Love Me' (famously covered by The Supremes and Temptations)[3]. Despite her talent, Dee Dee's career was often overshadowed by her sister's superstardom and the dominance of labelmates like Aretha Franklin and Roberta Flack at Atlantic Records[3]. She continued recording into the 1980s, with albums for Sutra and Heritage Records becoming collector's items[1][2]. Later in life, she returned to her gospel roots, performing in musicals and recording with Dionne. Dee Dee Warwick passed away on October 18, 2008, at age 66[1][4]. Her legacy endures as one of soul music's most respected yet underrated voices, celebrated for her contributions to both gospel and secular music.
