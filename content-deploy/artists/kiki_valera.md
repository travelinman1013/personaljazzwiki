## Biography
Kiki Valera, born in 1966 in Santiago de Cuba, is a renowned Cuban multi-instrumentalist, composer, arranger, sound engineer, and producer, internationally celebrated as a master of the Cuban cuatro. Raised in a deeply musical family, Kiki is the eldest son of Don Felix Valera Miranda, leader of the legendary Familia Valera Miranda, a group recognized as one of the most important purveyors of Son Cubano, Cuba’s iconic traditional music. Immersed in music from an early age, Kiki received his first tres at age six from his father and was taught the foundations of Cuban son in a household where music and dance were integral to daily life, passed down through generations since the 19th century.

Kiki pursued formal studies at the Conservatorio Esteban Salas in Santiago de Cuba, focusing on classical guitar before discovering his passion for the cuatro, which he customized and mastered, developing his own unique technique. Despite the restrictions on Western music in Cuba, Kiki ingeniously built his own shortwave radios to access jazz and other international sounds, drawing inspiration from artists like Pat Metheny, Wes Montgomery, and Chick Corea. Throughout his career, he has performed and recorded extensively with Familia Valera Miranda, co-founded Septeto Turquino, and collaborated with groups like Los Karachi. Now based in Seattle, Washington, Kiki continues to champion and modernize Cuban son, blending traditional roots with jazz influences, and is recognized as a vital bearer of Cuban musical heritage.
