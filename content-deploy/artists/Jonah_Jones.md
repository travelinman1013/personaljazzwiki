## Biography
Jonah Jones (born Robert Elliott Jones, December 31, 1909 – April 30, 2000) was a distinguished American jazz trumpeter known for his concise, swinging renditions of jazz and popular standards that appealed to broad audiences[1][5][6]. Raised in Louisville, Kentucky, Jones began his musical journey at the Booker T. Washington Community Center, initially playing alto saxophone before quickly excelling on trumpet[1][2][5]. His nickname 'Jonah' originated from a stuttering music instructor, and he was encouraged early on by Bessie T. Allen, the director of the orphanage where he lived[2][6].

Jones's career started on Mississippi riverboats in the 1920s, followed by stints with Horace Henderson and Jimmie Lunceford[1][5][6]. His early collaboration with violinist Stuff Smith from 1932 to 1936, and again from 1936 to 1940, was notable for its daring improvisations and creative interplay[1][5][6]. Jones later joined big bands led by Benny Carter and Fletcher Henderson, but his most prominent role was as a featured soloist in Cab Calloway's orchestra from 1941 to 1952, where he played alongside legends like Dizzy Gillespie[2][6].

In the 1950s, Jones formed his own quartet, developing a 'muted jazz' style characterized by subtle trumpet techniques and accessible arrangements[1][6]. His quartet, featuring George Rhodes (piano), John Browne (bass), and Harold Austin (drums), achieved commercial success with hits like "On The Street Where You Live" and "Baubles, Bangles and Beads," selling over a million copies[1][2][6]. Jones won a Grammy Award in 1959 for the album "I Dig Chicks"[2][6]. He continued performing into the 1980s, enjoyed international acclaim—especially in France—and was inducted into the Big Band and Jazz Hall of Fame in 1999[1][2]. He passed away in New York City at age 90.
