## Biography
Benjamin William Latimore, known professionally as Latimore, was born on September 7, 1939, in Charleston, Tennessee. Raised in a musically rich environment, he was influenced by country music, gospel from his Baptist church choir, and the blues, which would later define his signature sound. After a brief stint at Tennessee State University, Latimore moved to Miami in the early 1960s to pursue his musical ambitions, initially working as a pianist for various Florida-based groups and collaborating with artists like Steve Alaimo.

Latimore's recording career began in earnest in the mid-1960s with Dade Records, but his breakthrough came in the early 1970s after joining Glades Records. His 1973 rendition of T-Bone Walker's 'Stormy Monday' and the 1974 chart-topping 'Let's Straighten It Out' established him as a leading figure in blues and R&B. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Latimore released a string of successful albums and singles, later moving to Malaco Records, where he continued to record and perform well into the 21st century. Noted for his smooth, soulful vocals and expressive piano playing, Latimore's style blends blues, soul, and R&B, often exploring themes of love and personal reflection.

A respected session musician as well as a solo artist, Latimore has contributed to recordings by artists such as Joss Stone and has remained active in live performance, including appearances on national television. His enduring influence and contributions to American music were recognized with his induction into the Blues Hall of Fame in 2017, cementing his legacy as a pioneer of modern blues and soul.
