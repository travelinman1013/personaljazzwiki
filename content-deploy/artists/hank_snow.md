## Biography
Clarence Eugene "Hank" Snow, born May 9, 1914, in Brooklyn, Nova Scotia, began his musical journey amidst challenging circumstances.  His early life was marked by poverty, abuse, and hard labor during the Great Depression.  Despite this, his mother's encouragement and his own inherent musical talent, fostered by his musically inclined parents, led him to pursue a career in music. Inspired by country star Jimmie Rodgers, Snow initially played a Hawaiian steel guitar before transitioning to the guitar, honing his skills through self-teaching and local performances.  His early career included work as a fisherman and various odd jobs, but his determination to pursue music led him to radio performances under the name "Hank, The Yodeling Ranger."

Snow's career took off after securing a recording contract with RCA Victor in 1936.  His weekly CBC radio show and touring established him as a prominent figure in Canadian country music.  By the late 1940s, his popularity extended to the United States, leading him to relocate to Nashville in 1949.  His performance at the Grand Ole Opry in 1950 propelled him to national stardom, with "I'm Moving On" becoming a number-one hit for an impressive 21 weeks.  Subsequent number-one hits included "The Golden Rocket" and "The Rhumba Boogie," solidifying his place in country music history.  His collaboration with Hank Williams at Renfro Valley and his work with his son, Jimmie Rodgers Snow, further enriched his career.  He also played a significant role in launching Elvis Presley's career, providing him with stage time at the Grand Ole Opry and introducing him to Colonel Tom Parker.  Snow's song "I've Been Everywhere," a rendition of an Australian country song, became another major hit.  He continued to record prolifically, releasing 140 albums and charting over 85 singles on the Billboard country charts between 1950 and 1980.

Hank Snow's musical style was characterized by his distinctive yodeling and his songwriting, which covered a wide range of themes including joy, freedom, travel, anguish, and love, often inspired by his personal experiences.  His innovations included successfully blending various musical influences into his country sound.  His legacy is cemented by his induction into the Country Music Hall of Fame, the Canadian Country Music Hall of Fame, and the Canadian Music Hall of Fame.  His influence is evident in the numerous artists who have covered his music, including Elvis Presley, the Rolling Stones, Ray Charles, Johnny Cash, and Emmylou Harris.  His enduring impact is also reflected in his continued presence in popular culture, including a character partly based on him in Robert Altman's film *Nashville*, and his portrayal in Baz Luhrmann's *Elvis*.  He held the record for the oldest country artist to have a number-one hit for over 26 years.
