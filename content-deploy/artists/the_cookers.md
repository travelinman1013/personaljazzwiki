# The Cookers

## Quick Info
- **Genres**: hard bop, jazz
- **Spotify Popularity**: 5/100

- **Origin**: New York City, New York, United States

## Biography
The Cookers are a hard‑bop and post‑bop supergroup formed in the early 2000s by trumpeter and bandleader **David Weiss** as an outgrowth of a series of tribute concerts to the classic 1965 Freddie Hubbard live album *The Night of the Cookers*.[1][2][3] Initially conceived in the early 1990s as one‑off “Night of the Cookers/Freddie Hubbard Birthday” reunion gigs at the Up/Over Jazz Café in Brooklyn with veterans like Pete “La Roca” Sims and James Spaulding, the project gradually evolved as Weiss began combining players from these tributes with musicians he was working with in Charles Tolliver’s bands.[1][3] By 2007, after several personnel changes, a stable lineup “clicked” around tenor saxophonist **Billy Harper**, pianist **George Cables**, trumpeters **Eddie Henderson** and Weiss, bassist **Cecil McBee**, drummer **Billy Hart**, and later alto saxophonist **Donald Harrison**, and the working band officially became known as The Cookers.[1][2][3][4]

Collectively, The Cookers draw on more than four decades of experience each, embodying the driving, swing‑oriented hard bop and modal language that defined much of Black American Music from the mid‑1960s through the 1970s.[1][4][8] Most members came of age in the crucible of the New York jazz scene, cutting their teeth with major bandleaders: Harper and Cables served stints with **Art Blakey’s Jazz Messengers**; Hart and Henderson were core members of **Herbie Hancock’s Mwandishi** band; McBee anchored **Charles Lloyd’s** celebrated 1960s quartet and recorded with **Alice Coltrane**, **Pharoah Sanders**, **Jackie McLean**, and others.[1][4][8] Their repertoire mixes original compositions—often drawn from Harper, Cables, and other members—with arrangements that preserve the intensity and spiritual depth of 1960s–70s jazz while remaining a living, contemporary music. Critics and presenters frequently describe The Cookers as a “veritable jazz supergroup,” emphasizing both the historic weight of the individual players and the sense of camaraderie and “brotherhood” that animates the ensemble on stage.[1][2][4][7][9]

In performance and on record, The Cookers are known for long‑form, harmonically rich tunes, powerful horn lines, and a fiery but controlled group sound that reflects years of shared history among the players.[1][2][4] Their music channels influences from bebop through the avant‑garde: the Coltrane‑inspired spiritual intensity of Harper, the sophisticated harmonic palette of Cables, the exploratory post‑bop sensibility of the Mwandishi alumni, and the deep swing and flexibility of McBee and Hart.[1][4][8] While the group celebrates a golden era of jazz, it functions as a forward‑moving band rather than a repertory project, continually touring, recording, and expanding its book with new material. Presenters such as SFJAZZ and DownBeat highlight The Cookers as a vital link between generations, keeping the language of 1960s–70s hard bop and post‑bop vivid for contemporary audiences and younger musicians.[2][4][7][9]

## Fun Facts
- The band’s name and original concept come directly from Freddie Hubbard’s 1965 live album *The Night of the Cookers*; The Cookers began as reunion and tribute gigs built around musicians from that recording before evolving into a separate, permanent band.[1][2][3]
- Bassist Cecil McBee once played an early‑evening Los Angeles gig where bass legend Ray Brown was in the audience and personally praised his performance—McBee then immediately drove to the Monterey Jazz Festival and rushed onstage just in time for the concert that became Charles Lloyd’s classic live album *Forest Flower*.[5]
- Collectively, the members of The Cookers span birth years from 1935 (Cecil McBee) to 1964 (David Weiss), giving the group more than five centuries of combined life experience and several overlapping generations of jazz history inside one band.[4][9]
- Several core members—Billy Harper, Eddie Henderson, George Cables, Cecil McBee, and Billy Hart—had already recorded extensively with one another in various configurations over decades before The Cookers formally coalesced, making the group less a new project than a crystallization of a long‑standing musical brotherhood.[1][4][7]

- [[john_coltrane|John Coltrane]] - Major stylistic influence on tenor saxophonist Billy Harper, whose spiritual, intense playing and compositional voice in The Cookers draw heavily on Coltrane’s harmonic and emotional language.
