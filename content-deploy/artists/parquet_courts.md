## Biography
Parquet Courts is an American indie rock band formed in Brooklyn, New York, in 2010, though three of its four members—Andrew Savage, Austin Brown, and Max Savage—hail from Denton, Texas, while bassist Sean Yeaton is from Boston[1][3]. The band’s core, Savage and Brown, met at the University of North Texas, bonding over a shared love of music at a record-listening club Savage founded called 'Knights of the Round Turntable'[2][3]. After college, Brown moved to New York City in 2008, followed by Savage in 2009; both initially pursued solo and collaborative projects before reuniting to form Parquet Courts, with Max Savage (Andrew’s younger brother) joining on drums and Yeaton on bass[1][2][3]. Their early sound, as heard on the cassette-only debut 'American Specialties' and the breakthrough 'Light Up Gold', blends post-punk urgency, garage rock rawness, and literate, often surreal lyrics delivered with a distinctive bark—a style that has drawn comparisons to The Fall, Modern Lovers, and Neil Young[1][3]. Over the years, Parquet Courts have become celebrated for their sharp, lyrically driven songwriting, economical arrangements, and a sound that channels both the American and British underground, earning them a reputation as one of the most vital indie rock bands of their generation[1][3]. Their legacy lies in revitalizing guitar-driven, lyrically focused rock for a new era, with a discography that balances wit, social commentary, and restless experimentation.

## Fun Facts
- Parquet Courts’ drummer, Max Savage, joined the band just two weeks before their first gig in December 2010, learning the songs quickly as the band relied heavily on improvisation in their early days[2].
- The band’s name is a playful misspelling of 'parquet courts,' the basketball courts made of wooden tiles, reflecting their love of wordplay and New York City culture[1].
- Andrew Savage and Austin Brown first connected at a college record-listening club called 'Knights of the Round Turntable,' where they bonded over eclectic tastes ranging from Ornette Coleman to Belle and Sebastian[2][3].
- Sean Yeaton, the bassist, is the only member not originally from Texas; he was recruited after his band played a house show at Andrew Savage’s place in Denton, Texas[2][3].
