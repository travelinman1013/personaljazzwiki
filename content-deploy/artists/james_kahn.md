## Biography
James Kahn was born in Chicago, Illinois, in 1947. He began playing guitar at age 12, wrote his first song at 14, and developed a passion for storytelling through writing, music, and humor from a young age. After graduating from Maine Township High School West in 1965, he attended the University of Chicago, majoring in Biology, where he participated in the anti-Vietnam War movement and the 1968 Democratic Convention riots. Kahn pursued medicine, completing his residency in emergency medicine at USC/LA County and UCLA, working in busy LA hospitals while balancing family life, writing, and music.[1][2]

Kahn's career diversified into writing novels like the New World science fiction trilogy, and novelizations of major films including Return of the Jedi, Poltergeist, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, and The Goonies. He transitioned into television, writing for St. Elsewhere, creating characters for the sitcom E/R (featuring a young George Clooney), and producing Melrose Place from 1996-1998. In the 2000s, under the guidance of singer-songwriter Kate Wallace and producer David West, Kahn focused on music, releasing Americana/folk albums blending folk, blues, and country influences, such as Waterline (2011), Roadhouse Full of Blues (2012), and By the Risin' of the Sea, often with top session musicians elevating his heartfelt, narrative-driven songs.[1][2][3]

Kahn's musical style draws from folk traditions, reminiscent of James Taylor, emphasizing storytelling through acoustic vibes and themes of personal and collective crises. His legacy spans medicine, literature, screenwriting, and music, where he continues performing and recording as a multifaceted artist whose work reflects life's dramas and hopes.[3][4]
