## Biography
James Carroll Booker III (December 17, 1939 – November 8, 1983) was a New Orleans-born pianist and singer renowned for his flamboyant style, technical virtuosity, and genre-blending approach. A child prodigy, Booker received classical piano training from the age of six and played organ in his father's churches, mastering works by Chopin and Bach in his early teens. After a childhood accident left him with a limp and introduced him to morphine, Booker struggled with addiction throughout his life, a challenge that colored both his personal and professional trajectory.

Booker's career began early: by age 11, he was performing blues and gospel organ on local radio, and at 14, he recorded 'Doing the Hambone' for Imperial Records, reportedly as the label's youngest artist. His 1960 single 'Gonzo' became a national R&B hit, and he soon became a fixture in the New Orleans music scene, collaborating with local legends and touring internationally in the 1970s. Booker's style fused rhythm and blues, jazz, boogie-woogie, gospel, and classical music, often reinterpreting popular songs—such as those by The Beatles—with his signature syncopated backbeat and ornate improvisation.

Despite his struggles, Booker left a profound legacy in New Orleans and beyond. Known as the 'Piano Prince of New Orleans,' 'Bayou Maharajah,' and 'Black Liberace,' he influenced generations of musicians with his innovative playing and charismatic performances. His legendary residencies at venues like the Maple Leaf Bar, as well as his posthumous recordings and the documentary 'Bayou Maharajah,' have cemented his status as one of the most inventive and enigmatic figures in American music.
