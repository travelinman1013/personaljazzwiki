## Biography
Lucille Bogan (née Anderson; April 1, 1897 – August 10, 1948) was an American classic blues singer and songwriter, recognized as one of the earliest blues artists to be recorded and a pioneering figure in the genre. Her birthplace is disputed, with some sources citing Amory, Mississippi, and others Birmingham, Alabama, but census records and her own statements point to Birmingham as her hometown[3][5]. Raised in Alabama, she married Nazareth Lee Bogan in her teens and had a son before launching her musical career.

Bogan began recording in 1923 for Okeh Records, initially performing vaudeville songs with pianist Henry Callens. Later that year, she made history as the first Black blues singer to be recorded outside New York or Chicago, with "Pawn Shop Blues" in Atlanta[3][5]. Throughout the late 1920s and 1930s, she recorded for Paramount, Brunswick, Banner, and the American Record Company, often under the pseudonym Bessie Jackson to circumvent contractual restrictions[2][3]. Her musical style evolved from vaudeville roots to a raw, direct blues sound, characterized by candid lyrics addressing drinking, gambling, sexuality, and social realities. Notable songs include "Sloppy Drunk Blues," "Tricks Ain't Walking No More," and "Black Angel Blues," which became standards covered by later artists[3][4].

Bogan's legacy is defined by her fearless approach to taboo subjects, especially in her "dirty blues" repertoire, which featured explicit sexual themes and double entendres. Her influence extended to future generations of blues and jazz musicians, and she was posthumously recognized with induction into the Blues Hall of Fame in 2022[3][4].

## Fun Facts
- Lucille Bogan recorded some of the most sexually explicit blues songs of her era, including an unexpurgated version of "Shave 'Em Dry" that was not intended for public release but later became legendary for its rawness[4].
- She often used the pseudonym "Bessie Jackson" for recording, likely to bypass contractual limitations with record labels[2][3].
- Bogan was the first African-American blues singer to be recorded outside the major industry centers of New York and Chicago, with her 1923 Atlanta session[3][5].
- Her song "Groceries on the Shelf (Piggly Wiggly)" cleverly used the name of a supermarket chain as a metaphor for sexual availability, showcasing her wit and penchant for double entendre[3].
