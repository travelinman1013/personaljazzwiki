## Biography
Truckstop Honeymoon is an American acoustic duo consisting of husband and wife Mike West and Katie West (née Katie Euliss). The band's origins trace back to New Orleans, where Katie Euliss developed her musical foundation by performing in the streets of the French Quarter, learning to play wash-tub bass, blues piano, and guitar. This street-performing background deeply influenced the duo's approach to music, instilling in them a raw, authentic performance style that would become central to their artistic identity.

The duo is known for their highly personal and autobiographical songwriting approach, which emphasizes honesty and emotional directness. Their musical style blends elements of bluegrass, alt country, honky tonk, and Americana, creating a distinctive sound that reflects their roots in traditional American music while maintaining a contemporary sensibility.
