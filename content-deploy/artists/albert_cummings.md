## Biography
Albert Cummings is an American blues musician best known for his work with Blind Pig Records.  His musical journey began at age twelve with the five-string banjo, fostering a love for bluegrass music.  This early exposure to bluegrass, along with unspecified influences and teachers, laid the foundation for his later career in blues.  In his late twenties, he formed the trio Swamp Yankee, releasing their independently produced album *The Long Way* in 1999. This led to performances on the Northeast blues circuit and participation in the Blues Foundation's International Blues Challenge in Memphis that same year.

Following the release of *The Long Way*, Cummings' career progressed significantly.  He collaborated with Double Trouble, Stevie Ray Vaughan's rhythm section, featuring bassist Tommy Shannon and drummer Chris Layton, on his self-released solo debut *From the Heart* in 2003.  This recording marked Double Trouble's first project since Vaughan's death, with Reese Wynans also participating.  He subsequently signed a multi-album deal with Blind Pig Records in 2004, releasing *True to Yourself* that same year with Shannon on bass.  Further albums followed, including *Working Man* (2006), *Feels So Good* (a live album, 2008), *No Regrets* (2012), *Someone Like You* (2015), *Believe* (2020), *Ten* (2022), and *Strong* (2024), showcasing his evolving musical style and collaborations with various producers.  He also released an instructional DVD, *Working Man Blues Guitar*, in 2011.

Cummings' musical style blends elements of blues and rock, as evidenced by the description of *Ten* as "the blues rocker's gone country," suggesting an evolution and exploration of diverse influences.  His albums have achieved commercial success, with *No Regrets* reaching the top of the iTunes Blues Charts in the U.S., Canada, and France, and placing fifth on the Billboard blues chart.  His career demonstrates a consistent output of recorded music, instructional materials, and live performances, establishing him as a significant figure in contemporary blues.  His collaborations with renowned musicians and his consistent album releases solidify his lasting impact on the genre.
