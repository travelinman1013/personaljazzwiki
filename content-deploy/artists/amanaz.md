## Biography
Amanaz was a Zamrock band formed in 1973 in Kitwe, Zambia's third-largest city, during a pivotal moment in the nation's musical history. The band emerged from the convergence of several established musicians: vocalist Keith Kabwe (formerly of the Klasters), bassist Jerry Mausala (from the disbanded Macbeth), guitarist Isaac Mpofu (from Wrong Number), rhythm guitarist John Kanyepa (who left the Black Souls to join), and drummer Watson Lungu. The band's name stood for "Ask Me About Nice Artistes in Zambia," reflecting the pride and nationalist spirit of the Zamrock movement that flourished following Zambia's independence in 1964, when President Kenneth Kaunda mandated that 95% of radio music be Zambian in origin. Amanaz quickly became known throughout the Copperbelt region, performing at country clubs, Hindu halls, and competing with contemporaries like WITCH and Gas Company, while drawing attention from major music promoters including Zambia Music Parlour Limited director Edward Khuzwayo and producer Billy Nyati.

The band's sole album, "Africa," released in 1975 on both Teal and Zambia Music Parlour labels and recorded at Malachite Studios in Chingola, became a landmark in African rock music. Remarkably, the album was written and prepared in just three days, yet it carried significant conceptual weight, addressing themes of colonialism and slavery through tracks like the title song "Africa" and "Kale," while challenging hegemonic narratives with "History of Man." The recording was initially treated with skepticism by both the band and producer Billy Nyati, who added reverb to an alternate master in hopes of improving the unusual sound—ironically, both versions became equally admired. The album showcased the band's eclectic influences, blending psychedelic rock, funk, reggae, and the guitar virtuosity of Jimi Hendrix, with Isaac Mpofu's guitar work becoming one of the band's major draws. Vocalist Kabwe contributed theatrical stage presence inspired by Alice Cooper and David Bowie, famously emerging from a coffin in skeleton costume to open performances.

Amanaz disbanded in 1976 following internal differences, with Kabwe subsequently forming Drive Unit (a short-lived project that also featured bassist Ricky Banda), while Mpofu launched his own project as the Heathen. Though the band's active period was brief, "Africa" was rediscovered and rightfully identified as an African rock masterpiece during the first wave of Zamrock reissues in the 2000s, establishing Amanaz's enduring legacy in both Zambian music history and the broader global recognition of African rock music.
