## Biography
Ledisi, born in New Orleans and raised in Oakland, California, is an American singer-songwriter, music producer, author, and actress whose name means 'to bring forth' or 'to come here' in Yoruba. Heavily influenced by soul icons like Nina Simone, she began her career in 1995 by forming the band Anibade after her middle name and independently releasing her debut album *Soulsinger* in 2000 on LeSun Music, which gained local airplay with the single 'Take Time.' Her second album, *Feeling Orange but Sometimes Blue* (2002), blended jazz standards and won Outstanding Jazz Album at the 2003 California Music Awards, showcasing her early fusion of contemporary R&B, jazz, funk, pop, and soul.

Signing with Verve Forecast in 2006 marked a pivotal shift, leading to her third album *Lost & Found* (2007), which earned Grammy nominations including Best New Artist. She released multiple albums on Verve, including *Turn Me Loose* (2009), which topped the Billboard Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, and *Pieces of Me* (2011). Ledisi expanded into acting with roles like Mahalia Jackson in *Selma* (2014) and Patti LaBelle in *American Soul*, while returning to theater in shows like *The Life* directed by Billy Porter. Her first Grammy win came in 2021 for Best Traditional R&B Performance for 'Anything for You' from *The Wild Card*, released on her own Listen Back Entertainment label, solidifying her legacy as a versatile soul and jazz powerhouse with 14 Grammy nominations.

Ledisi's musical style evolved from R&B roots to jazz explorations, as seen in *Ledisi Sings Nina* (2021), a dream project honoring Nina Simone featuring the Metropole Orkest and New Orleans Jazz Orchestra, praised by John Legend. Her enduring impact spans music, theater, film, and authorship, including her 2018 autobiography *The Walk: Accepting Your Life As It Is Now*, establishing her as a multifaceted artist over two decades.
