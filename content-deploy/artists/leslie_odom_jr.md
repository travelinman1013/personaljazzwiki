## Biography
Leslie Odom Jr. (born Leslie Lloyd Odom Jr. on August 6, 1981) is an American actor, singer, and songwriter whose career bridges Broadway, film, television, and jazz-influenced popular music.[1][2] Born in Queens, New York, and raised in Philadelphia, he grew up singing in the choir at Canaan Baptist Church and attended Julia R. Masterman School and the Philadelphia High School for Creative and Performing Arts, where his interest in performance deepened.[1][2] At 13 he won an oratory competition on African American history that led to a scholarship at Philadelphia’s Freedom Theatre, Pennsylvania’s oldest African American theater, and by 17 he had made his Broadway debut in the musical *Rent* while still in high school, an experience he credits with cementing his love of musical theater.[1]

After choosing to leave Broadway to train formally, Odom earned a BFA from Carnegie Mellon University’s School of Drama in 2003 and then moved to Los Angeles, building a screen career with roles in series such as *CSI: Miami*, *Vanished*, *Big Day*, *Smash*, *Person of Interest*, and *Law & Order: Special Victims Unit*.[1][2] His defining breakthrough came with Lin-Manuel Miranda’s *Hamilton*, in which his nuanced performance as Aaron Burr in the original Broadway cast earned him the 2016 Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical and a Grammy Award for Best Musical Theater Album; the role was later preserved in the filmed stage production released on Disney+ and brought him a Primetime Emmy nomination.[1][3][5] Parallel to his acting work, he has released both standards and original music on albums such as his self-titled debut (2014), *Simply Christmas* (2016, reissued 2017), *Mr* (2019), *The Christmas Album* (2020), and *When a Crooner Dies* (2023), projects that showcase a smooth, jazz-soul vocal style and an interest in storytelling about Black identity and personal resilience.[1]

Odom has extended his reach into film with prominent roles in *Red Tails*, *Murder on the Orient Express*, *Only*, *Harriet*, *One Night in Miami…*, and *The Exorcist: Believer*, earning two Academy Award nominations for acting and songwriting for *One Night in Miami…* as singer Sam Cooke.[2][5] His artistic profile also includes authorship—his motivational memoir *Failing Up: How to Take Risks, Aim Higher and Never Stop Learning* was published in 2018—and frequent concert and speaking appearances that emphasize mentorship and disciplined risk-taking.[1][3] Widely regarded as a multifaceted modern Broadway star, Odom’s legacy is tied not only to redefining the role of Aaron Burr for a new generation but also to expanding the lane for Black male vocalists who move fluidly among theater, jazz, and contemporary pop while maintaining high-level acting careers.[1][5][6]

## Fun Facts
- Odom won an oratory contest on African American history at age 13, which earned him a scholarship to Philadelphia’s Freedom Theatre and effectively launched his formal path into professional acting.[1]
- He joined the Broadway cast of *Rent* at just 17 years old while still in high school, making his debut as a replacement in the ensemble before pursuing conservatory training instead of immediately continuing on Broadway.[1][2]
- His performance as Aaron Burr in *Hamilton* earned him a Tony Award and a Grammy Award, and the filmed stage version later brought him a Primetime Emmy nomination for his work in the same role.[1][3][5]
- Beyond performing, Odom wrote a motivational book, *Failing Up*, structured like a commencement speech, in which he frames his career as a series of risks and learning opportunities for young artists.[1]
