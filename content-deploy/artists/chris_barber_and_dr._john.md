## Biography
Chris Barber (Donald Christopher Barber, 1930–2021) was a pioneering English jazz trombonist and bandleader, widely regarded as one of the most influential figures in British traditional jazz and blues. Born in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, Barber began playing violin at age seven before shifting to trombone and double bass. He studied at the Guildhall School of Music and quickly became active in the postwar British jazz scene, forming his first band in 1949 and co-founding Ken Colyer’s Jazzmen in 1953, which soon became the Chris Barber Band.

Barber’s band was central to the British trad jazz movement, blending Dixieland, ragtime, swing, blues, and R&B. He was instrumental in popularizing skiffle through collaborations with Lonnie Donegan and in introducing British audiences to American blues legends like Big Bill Broonzy and Muddy Waters. Barber’s open-minded approach led to collaborations with artists from various genres, including the New Orleans pianist and singer Dr. John. Their joint album, 'Down On The Bayou,' showcased a fusion of British trad jazz with New Orleans R&B and funk, highlighting Barber’s versatility and Dr. John’s signature style.

Barber’s legacy extends beyond his own recordings: he helped launch the careers of numerous musicians and played a key role in the British rhythm and blues boom, influencing artists who would shape the sound of the 1960s and beyond. His band continued performing for over 70 years, adapting to changing musical landscapes while preserving the spirit of early jazz.
