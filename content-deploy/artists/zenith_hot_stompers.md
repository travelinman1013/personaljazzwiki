## Biography
Zenith Hot Stompers was a British traditional jazz and swing band active on the UK jazz and festival circuit from the mid‑20th century, known especially in the Midlands for its lively, dance‑oriented repertoire. A description attached to surviving live footage notes that the band was founded in 1964 and became regarded as the Midlands’ premier traditional jazz band, indicating that it emerged during the post‑revival wave of interest in classic New Orleans and Chicago styles among British musicians and audiences.[1] Their sound was rooted in early jazz and swing, with a small‑group front line and a rhythm section geared toward strong, stomping dance tempos rather than modern jazz experimentation.[1]

Over the decades the Zenith Hot Stompers appeared at UK traditional jazz festivals and club dates, including events such as the Bude Jazz Festival around 2000, where the band is documented in performance.[1] The long lifespan suggested by that recording, combined with its reputation as a leading Midlands traditional band, points to a stable regional following built on faithful interpretations of early jazz, swing standards, and popular tunes of the 1920s–40s.[1] Although detailed personnel histories and discographies are not readily documented in major reference sources, surviving video and commentary portray the group as part of the broader British trad‑jazz movement that kept pre‑bop jazz styles in active performance well into the late 20th century.[1]

Within this context, Zenith Hot Stompers’ legacy lies mainly in preserving and presenting classic jazz and swing repertoire for dancers and listeners in central England, helping sustain a live scene for traditional jazz outside London at a time when mainstream tastes were shifting toward rock, pop, and later fusion.[1] The band’s continued activity into at least the early 2000s demonstrates the durability of the trad‑jazz community in the UK and the value placed on maintaining a direct, performance‑based link to early jazz idioms rather than treating them only as archival music.[1]
