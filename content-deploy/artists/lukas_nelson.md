## Biography
Lukas Nelson was born on December 25, 1988, and is an American singer-songwriter who has established himself as one of music's most respected voices.[1][5] The son of country music legend Willie Nelson, Lukas began his musical journey at a very young age, taking guitar lessons from Maui-based gypsy-jazz guitarist Tom Conway by age 13, practicing eight to ten hours daily.[2] Despite his musical inclinations, he initially pursued higher education at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles in 2007, but his path changed dramatically when he attended a Neil Young concert where he met drummer Anthony LoGerfo, leading him to drop out of college and form Lukas Nelson & Promise of the Real in 2008.[1][2]

Throughout the 2010s, Nelson's primary musical outlet became his band Promise of the Real, which gained prominence through collaborations with Neil Young, including backing him on tour and recording his 2015 album "The Monsanto Years."[2] A pivotal moment came in 2016 when actor Bradley Cooper discovered Nelson performing at the Desert Trip Festival and recruited him to co-write and produce music for the 2018 film "A Star Is Born," alongside Lady Gaga.[1][2] This work earned Nelson a Grammy Award for Best Compilation Soundtrack for Visual Media and a BAFTA Award for Best Original Music in 2019.[1] After more than a decade with Promise of the Real, which announced an indefinite hiatus in June 2024, Nelson embarked on his solo career, releasing his debut album "American Romance" on June 20, 2025, produced by Shooter Jennings.[1][3] The album showcases Nelson's most vulnerable and honest work to date, featuring collaborations with Sierra Ferrell and Stephen Wilson Jr., and has earned him a Grammy nomination for Best Traditional Country Album in 2026.[1][3]

Nelson's career is characterized by his ability to blend traditional country and Americana influences with contemporary production, his captivating live performances, and his willingness to explore new musical territories.[5][6] His work spans multiple dimensions—as a solo artist, bandleader, film composer, and collaborator—demonstrating his versatility and creative depth within the music industry.

## Fun Facts
- Lukas Nelson met his future bandmate Anthony LoGerfo at a Neil Young concert in Los Angeles, and they decided to start a band together that same night, eventually naming it Promise of the Real after a lyric from Neil Young's 1974 song 'Walk On.'[1][2]
- At age 13, Nelson was already practicing guitar eight to ten hours daily under the tutelage of gypsy-jazz guitarist Tom Conway, demonstrating exceptional dedication to his craft from an early age.[2]
- Nelson wrote a song called 'Forget About Georgia' inspired by playing 'Georgia On My Mind' every night while touring with his father Willie Nelson—the repetition of the song made him unable to forget about a girl, prompting him to write his own composition.[2]
- Nelson not only co-wrote and produced music for the 2018 film 'A Star Is Born,' but also appeared in the movie as part of the backing band for Bradley Cooper's character Jackson Maine, and his work on the soundtrack earned him both a Grammy Award and a BAFTA Award.[1][5][6]
