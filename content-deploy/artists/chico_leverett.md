## Biography
Charles "Chico" Leverett was an American singer and songwriter who played a foundational role in the early days of Motown. Born in Detroit, Michigan, Leverett emerged from the vibrant local R&B and doo-wop scene, quickly becoming known for his smooth vocal style and songwriting talent. He was a founding member of The Satintones, the first group ever to record for Motown, predating even the Miracles. Leverett's creative force helped shape the group's sound, which blended tight harmonies with the emerging Motown aesthetic.

Leverett also recorded as a solo artist, releasing "Solid Sender" on Tamla Records in 1959, before the Motown name was officially adopted. His work with The Satintones included several singles between 1959 and 1961, such as "Going to the Hop" and "Motor City." Although the group never achieved commercial success, their recordings laid important groundwork for the Motown sound and contributed to the label's early identity. Leverett left The Satintones in 1961, and the group soon disbanded, but his influence persisted through Motown's formative years.

Leverett's musical style was rooted in doo-wop and R&B, characterized by melodic vocal arrangements and lyrical storytelling. His legacy is that of a Motown pioneer, whose contributions are often overshadowed by later stars but remain significant in the history of American popular music. Chico Leverett passed away on December 5, 2013, at the age of 79, leaving behind a modest but important catalog of recordings that continue to be rediscovered by enthusiasts of early Motown.
