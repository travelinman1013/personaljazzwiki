## Biography
Los Lobos is a pioneering Mexican American rock band formed in 1973 in East Los Angeles, California, by David Hidalgo, Louie Pérez, Cesar Rosas, and Conrad Lozano. The founding members met at Garfield High School and bonded over their eclectic musical tastes, ranging from traditional Mexican folk to American rock, blues, and jazz. Initially, the group played revved-up versions of Mexican folk music at local restaurants, weddings, and parties, gradually building a reputation in the East L.A. community.

By the late 1970s and early 1980s, Los Lobos began to incorporate more rock and roll and other American genres into their sound, reflecting their bicultural upbringing. Their breakthrough came with the Grammy-winning EP '...And a Time to Dance' (1983) and their major-label debut 'How Will the Wolf Survive?' (1984), which received critical acclaim. Their cover of Ritchie Valens' 'La Bamba' for the 1987 biopic catapulted them to international fame, topping charts in the U.S. and U.K. Rather than rest on commercial success, the band continued to explore their roots, releasing the Grammy-winning 'La Pistola y El Corazón' (1988) as a tribute to Tejano and mariachi music, and later the acclaimed 'Kiko' (1992).

Los Lobos is celebrated for their genre-blending style, fusing rock, Tex-Mex, country, folk, R&B, blues, and traditional Mexican music. Over five decades, they have released more than a dozen studio albums, won multiple Grammy Awards, and influenced generations of musicians while remaining true to their Chicano heritage and the 'soundtrack of the barrio.' Their enduring legacy is marked by both critical acclaim and a deep connection to their cultural roots.

## Fun Facts
- Los Lobos' name means 'The Wolves' in Spanish, and their original full name was 'Los Lobos del Este (de Los Angeles),' a playful nod to the norteño band Los Tigres del Norte.
- Before their commercial breakthrough, Los Lobos played hundreds of weddings and parties in East L.A.—they joked that if you were married there between 1973 and 1980, they probably played your wedding.
- Their 1987 cover of 'La Bamba' not only topped U.S. and U.K. charts but also introduced a new generation to the legacy of Ritchie Valens.
- Despite international fame, the core lineup of Los Lobos has remained remarkably stable for over five decades.
