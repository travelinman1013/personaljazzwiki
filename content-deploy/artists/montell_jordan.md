## Biography
Montell Du'Sean Jordan was born on December 3, 1968, in South Central Los Angeles to parents Elijah and Delois Jordan, who worked as deacons in their Baptist church.[1] Growing up in a deeply religious household, Jordan developed his musical talents early, playing piano for his church as a child. He attended Junipero Serra High School in Gardena, California, and later earned a bachelor's degree in communications from Pepperdine University in Malibu, California, graduating in 1991.[1] After college, Jordan worked for Williams Television Time creating TV infomercials while pursuing his music career. His breakthrough came when he invited coworkers to a showcase that caught the attention of Janet Jackson and Shanice Wilson, leading him to create his first mix-tape and eventually connect with Russell Simmons of Def Jam Records.[1]

Jordan's meteoric rise began in 1995 when he signed to Def Jam as the second R&B artist on the label, becoming the primary male solo artist on Def Soul until 2003.[1] His debut single, "This Is How We Do It," sampled Slick Rick's "Children's Story" and became a defining new jack swing anthem, reaching No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and remaining there for seven consecutive weeks.[1][5] The song, which Jordan described as "a reflection of what street life was for a kid who grew up in the neighborhood," propelled his debut album to platinum status with over a million copies sold.[1] Throughout his nearly twenty-year music career, Jordan released seven studio albums and fourteen singles, selling more than 10 million records worldwide and earning a Grammy nomination for Best Male R&B Performance.[2][3] His other notable hits included "Let's Ride" featuring Master P and Silkk the Shocker in 1998 and "Get It On Tonite."[1]

In 2010, Jordan underwent a significant spiritual transformation, becoming the worship leader and later executive pastor at Victory World Church in Norcross, Georgia.[1] During a church fast, he felt called by God to leave the music industry and dedicate himself to ministry.[1] Since then, Jordan has focused on his faith-based work, co-founding Master Peace Church with his wife Kristin as a fully virtual ministry from 2022 to 2024, and establishing Marriage Masterpeace Inc., a non-profit organization dedicated to strengthening marriages worldwide.[3][4] He has also become an ordained minister and champion ambassador for Special Olympics, using his platform to advocate for children with special needs and their families.[3]
