## Biography
Howlin' Wolf, born Chester Arthur Burnett on June 10, 1910, in White Station near West Point, Mississippi, emerged from a childhood marked by poverty and hardship to become one of the most influential figures in blues history. Raised on a cotton plantation, he was deeply influenced by the traditional music of the Mississippi Delta. After his parents separated, he endured a difficult upbringing with an uncle before rejoining his father as a teenager. Inspired by the legendary Charley Patton, Wolf learned guitar and performance techniques, and received harmonica instruction from Sonny Boy Williamson (Rice Miller), integrating these lessons into his own powerful, growling vocal style and dynamic stage presence.

Wolf began performing in juke joints across Mississippi in the 1920s and 1930s, gradually building a reputation for his electrifying performances. In the 1940s, he formed his own group in Arkansas and eventually caught the attention of Ike Turner, who helped him record his first single, 'Moanin' at Midnight,' in 1951. This success led to a contract with Chess Records in Chicago, where Wolf became a central figure in the transformation of Delta blues into the electric Chicago blues sound. His classic recordings, including 'Spoonful,' 'Smokestack Lightning,' and 'Killing Floor,' defined the genre and influenced generations of musicians. Wolf remained a commanding presence on stage and in the studio until his death in 1976, leaving a legacy honored by induction into both the Blues and Rock and Roll Halls of Fame.
