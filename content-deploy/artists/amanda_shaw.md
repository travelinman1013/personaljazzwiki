## Biography
Amanda Christian Amaya-Shaw, born August 2, 1990, in Mandeville, Louisiana, began her musical journey at age four with classical violin lessons at Southeastern Louisiana University's Community Music School. By age eight, she transitioned to Cajun music, immersing herself in the vibrant sounds of New Orleans, including fais do-dos, jazz, blues, funk, and rock 'n' roll, despite growing up on the opposite side of the state from Cajun music's birthplace in Lafayette. A child prodigy, she released her first independent album, *Little Black Dog*, in 2001 at around age 11, followed by *I'm Not a Bubble Gum Pop Princess* in 2004, which blended traditional Cajun melodies with covers like The Clash's 'Should I Stay or Should I Go?' and The Ramones' 'I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend' (retitled 'Girlfriend').[2][1][3]
