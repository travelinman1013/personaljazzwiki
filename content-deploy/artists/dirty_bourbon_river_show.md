## Biography
The Dirty Bourbon River Show is a New Orleans-based band known for their high-energy 'New Orleans Big Brass Circus Rock' sound, blending hard-edged blues, Lisztian piano ballads, New Orleans brass, gypsy folk, and circus elements into theatrical performances featuring multi-instrumentalism, instrument switching mid-song, group chants, stomps, and fireballs.[1][3][6] Formed in early 2009 at Tipitina's in New Orleans, the band quickly built a reputation through relentless touring, playing over 900 live shows across the USA and Europe while releasing 9 studio albums, often at a pace of two per year since 2010.[1][2][3] Their music pairs exuberant, syncopated lyrics with complex, harmony-rich songwriting and orchestration, captivating audiences with eccentricity and dexterity that evokes bygone musical eras.[1][8]

Core members have included Noah Adams (vocals, piano, guitar, accordion, trumpet, trombone, drums, percussion), Matt Thomas (vocals, tenor and baritone saxophone, clarinet), Nick Garrison (vocals, trombone, piano), Jimmy Williams (bass, sousaphone, flute), and Scott Graves (vocals, drums, percussion), all multi-instrumentalists and singers who emphasize theatricality.[1][8] The lineup evolved over time, with notable changes such as Charlie Skinner's departure around 2014 after serving as ringleader and trombonist, and additions like Logan Van Meter as 'Band Consigliere' and guest vocalist Sandra Love for tours.[2][4] By their 10-year anniversary in 2019, they celebrated with a concert at Tipitina's alongside Bon Bon Vivant and original members, marking a decade of independent production of over 100 songs.[4][5]

The band's legacy lies in their prolific output and live prowess, fostering a sense of escape to a whimsical, whiskey-soaked New Orleans vibe through festivals, respected venues, and international tours, including the UK, while maintaining a tight, multi-faceted sound that continues to draw fans despite lineup shifts.[1][2][4][5]
