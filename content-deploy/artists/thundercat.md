## Biography
Stephen Lee Bruner, professionally known as Thundercat, was born on October 19, 1984, in Los Angeles, California, and grew up in Compton and surrounding areas of Los Angeles. He was born into a deeply musical family—his father, Ronald Bruner Sr., is an internationally renowned jazz drummer who performed with the Temptations, Diana Ross, and Gladys Knight, while his brother Ronald Bruner Jr. is a Grammy-winning drummer who has collaborated with jazz legends like Stanley Clarke and Wayne Shorter. This rich musical heritage provided the foundation for Thundercat's extraordinary career. He began playing bass guitar at a very young age, drawing inspiration from virtuosos like Stanley Clarke. By his mid-teens, Thundercat was already performing professionally, joining the punk band Suicidal Tendencies as their bassist while still in high school and touring internationally with Stanley Clarke at just 16 years old.

Thundercat's transition from session musician to solo artist was catalyzed by his collaborations with producer Flying Lotus and singer Erykah Badu in the mid-2000s. After appearing on Erykah Badu's 2008 album *New Amerykah Part One (4th World War)* and Flying Lotus's 2010 album *Cosmogramma*, Flying Lotus signed Thundercat to his Brainfeeder label and produced his debut solo album, *The Golden Age of Apocalypse* (2011). This marked a pivotal moment, establishing Thundercat as a distinctive voice that transcended genre boundaries. He subsequently released *Apocalypse* (2013) and the critically acclaimed *Drunk* (2017), which solidified his reputation as a multi-Grammy-winning artist and bonafide star. His work encompasses elements of R&B, funk, soul, jazz fusion, and hip-hop, with notable contributions to Kendrick Lamar's landmark 2012 album *To Pimp a Butterfly*.

Thundercat's artistic legacy extends beyond his virtuosic bass playing and innovative songwriting. The stage name itself references the animated series he loved since childhood and reflects his wide-eyed, vibrant approach to music—a connection that came full circle in 2020 when he voiced a character named "Grune the Destroyer" and composed a song for Cartoon Network's *Thundercats Roar*. His influence spans multiple genres and generations of musicians, and in 2020, *Rolling Stone* magazine recognized him as one of the greatest bass players of all time. Thundercat continues to be a prolific session musician and collaborator, working across hip-hop, R&B, and jazz contexts while maintaining his position as one of the most innovative and technically skilled musicians of the 21st century.
