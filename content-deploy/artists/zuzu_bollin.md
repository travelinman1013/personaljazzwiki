## Biography
Zuzu Bollin, born A.D. Bollin on September 5, 1922, in Frisco, Texas, was a notable figure in the Texas blues scene, renowned for his expressive guitar playing and soulful vocals. Growing up next to a juke joint, Bollin was immersed in the sounds of blues and swing from an early age, absorbing influences from artists like Blind Lemon Jefferson, Peetie Wheatstraw, Leroy Carr, and big band leaders such as Count Basie and Artie Shaw. Initially, music was not his intended career—he planned to work pressing clothes after serving in the Navy, where he occasionally played hillbilly songs for officers. However, a chance opportunity to sing in Omaha launched his professional journey, leading him to join the Ernie Fields Orchestra and later perform with other prominent musicians.

Bollin's specialty was 'jump' blues, a style that fused the emotional depth of rural blues with the urbane swing of big-band jazz. In 1951, he recorded his best-known tracks, 'Why Don't You Eat Where You Slept Last Night' and 'Headlight Blues,' for Dallas-based Torch Records, with a band that included saxophonist David 'Fathead' Newman. Despite early promise, Bollin faded into obscurity for decades, presumed dead by many, until blues enthusiast Chuck Nevitt rediscovered him in Dallas in 1988. Nevitt organized a comeback, producing Bollin's first full-length album, 'Texas Bluesman,' in 1989, which revitalized his career and led to festival appearances in the U.S. and Europe. Bollin's late-life resurgence was cut short by his death in Dallas on October 19, 1990, but his legacy endures as a symbol of Texas blues resilience and artistry.
