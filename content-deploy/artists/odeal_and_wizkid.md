## Biography
Odeal & Wizkid refers to a cross-generational pairing between German‑Nigerian singer‑songwriter **Odeal** (Hillary Dennis Udanoh) and Nigerian Afrobeats star **Wizkid** (Ayodeji Ibrahim Balogun), typically encountered on streaming platforms via collaborative or jointly‑credited tracks and playlists rather than as a fixed duo or band. Odeal was born in Germany to Nigerian parents and raised between Spain, Nigeria and the UK, experiences that strongly shaped his hybrid sound.[4][5][6] As a teenager he attended boarding school in Awka, Anambra State, Nigeria, where he discovered a youth‑club studio, began recording his own songs, and taught himself production, even installing FruityLoops on a school computer to make beats at night.[2][3] Returning to London around 2017, he immersed himself in the emerging UK Afroswing scene, briefly worked with the collective TMG, and then pursued a solo path, releasing his early EPs independently and later through his OVMBR collective and label.[2][3]

Musically, Odeal blends Afrobeats, R&B, alté and UK rap/dance textures, drawing on icons like James Brown as well as African stars Fela Kuti, Burna Boy and Wizkid, whose work helped him imagine how to fuse African rhythms with contemporary soul and R&B vocalism.[3][4] His projects from *Pragma* and *OVMBR: Roses* through *Thoughts I Never Said* and *Sunday at Zuri* gradually built a reputation for mellow, introspective songwriting and genre‑fluid production, culminating in the viral success of “Soh‑Soh,” which charted on both the UK and U.S. Afrobeats charts and in Nigeria.[2] In 2024–25 he consolidated that momentum with further EPs (*Sunday at Zuri*, *The Summer That Saved Me*), label‑services deals and prominent features, while being singled out by Billboard as an important new African artist.[2] Within that ecosystem, Wizkid functions more as a towering stylistic influence and benchmark for Afrobeats and alté‑leaning singers like Odeal than as a formal bandmate, making “Odeal & Wizkid” best understood as a pairing of artist and influence rather than a separate biographical entity.

Wizkid himself, although not the primary subject here, is a Lagos‑born singer who rose from local church choirs and teenage groups to global prominence in the 2010s through albums like *Superstar* and *Ayo* and collaborations with Drake, Beyoncé and many others, helping define Afrobeats’ international sound. His melodic phrasing, laid‑back delivery and fusion of Nigerian pop with global R&B and dance music are part of the lineage that artists like Odeal inherit and reinterpret.[1][3][4] Thus, the “Odeal & Wizkid” tag most accurately signals the intersection of Odeal’s alté/afro‑R&B approach with the broader Wizkid‑shaped Afrobeats tradition, rather than a discrete, jointly‑operating group.

## Fun Facts
- As a teenager in Nigerian boarding school, Odeal secretly installed FruityLoops on a school computer and produced beats late at night until he was caught, an incident that nevertheless confirmed his dedication to music.[2]
- He once sold his beloved camera and Beats headphones to afford a new laptop, prioritizing music production over personal possessions so he could independently create his debut EP material.[3]
- Odeal’s upbringing stretched across Germany, Spain, Nigeria and the UK, giving him multiple accents and musical dialects that he consciously weaves into his vocal delivery and production choices.[4][5][6]
- His breakout single “Soh‑Soh” not only went viral on TikTok but also charted simultaneously on the UK Afrobeats Singles Chart, the Billboard U.S. Afrobeats Songs chart, and the Official Nigeria Top 100, signalling his truly transnational appeal.[2]

### Mentors/Influences
- [[james_brown|James Brown]] - Formative listening that shaped Odeal’s sense of groove, performance and soulful expression in his early development as a producer and singer. (General catalog cited as his “jump off point,” rather than specific albums, during his boarding‑school years in Nigeria.) [Early–mid 2010s (teenage years in boarding school).]
- [[fela_kuti|Fela Kuti]] - Local Afrobeat hero whose extended grooves, political edge and horn‑driven arrangements informed Odeal’s understanding of African music and its fusion with modern R&B. (Referenced broadly as an influence discovered while in Nigeria, via local listening and cultural context.) [Mid‑2010s onward, beginning in boarding school and continuing through his career.[1][3][4]]
- [[burna_boy|Burna Boy]] - Contemporary Afrobeats star whose afro‑fusion template offered a modern, globally‑minded model for blending African rhythms with pop and R&B, something Odeal later pursued in his own work. (Not tied to a single recording; cited as a key influence alongside Fela Kuti and Wizkid on Odeal’s developing style.[3][4]) [Mid‑2010s onward.]
- [[wizkid|Wizkid]] - Major stylistic influence and aspirational figure in Afrobeats whose melodic, R&B‑inflected approach shaped Odeal’s sense of what African pop could sound like globally. (Referenced broadly as an influence during Odeal’s formative years; specific tracks are not singled out in available sources.[1][3][4]) [Mid‑2010s onward.]

### Key Collaborators
- [[tmg|TMG]] - Early collective with whom Odeal collaborated in London Afroswing circles before moving fully into solo work. (Collaborative tracks and early material prior to his debut EP; individual song titles are not detailed in available sources.[2]) [Circa 2016–2017.]
- [[gabzy|Gabzy]] - Afrobeats/afro‑fusion collaborator within the UK/Nigerian alté scene, helping solidify Odeal’s presence across both spaces. (Collaborative tracks highlighted in profiles of Odeal; specific joint releases are mentioned generally as evidence of his range.[7]) [Early 2020s.]
- [[nines|Nines]] - UK rapper with whom Odeal has collaborated, showcasing his ability to bridge Afrobeats, R&B and UK rap. (Featured collaborations noted in interviews and profiles; exact track list not fully itemized in the cited sources.[7]) [Early 2020s.]

### Artists Influenced
- [[emerging_uk_alté_and_afrorandb_artists_general_cohort|Emerging UK alté and afro‑R&B artists (general cohort)]] - Industry and media descriptions position Odeal as a pioneer or leading figure in the UK alté and afro‑fusion space, suggesting his work has helped define a template for younger artists blending Afrobeats, R&B and UK sounds. (EPs such as *Pragma*, *OVMBR: Roses*, *Thoughts I Never Said*, *Sunday at Zuri* and singles like “Soh‑Soh” serve as reference points for this emerging style.[2][3][5][6]) [Late 2010s–2020s.]
