## Biography
Guitar Crusher was the stage name of Sidney Selby, an American blues singer and guitarist born on July 28, 1931, in rural Hyde County, North Carolina.[2][4] Growing up during the Great Depression, he worked in the cotton fields as a child before turning to music, singing in church and absorbing the blues, gospel, and rhythm-and-blues sounds that surrounded him.[2][4] He later moved north—eventually basing himself in New York—where he developed a powerful, gritty vocal style that earned him the nickname “Bone Crusher” before he became widely known as Guitar Crusher.[2]

Selby emerged on the club and touring circuit as a robust shouter in the classic blues and R&B tradition, combining raw, emotional vocals with straightforward guitar accompaniment.[2][4] Over the years he recorded and performed with various bands, appeared on the European blues circuit, and released albums that showcased a mix of traditional blues, soul-inflected numbers, and hard-driving R&B.[2][4] His stage presence and commanding voice made him a favorite among blues aficionados, and he continued performing well into later life. Selby died on September 23, 2020, leaving behind a modest but respected legacy as a classic blues shouter who bridged Southern roots with the urban blues sound.[2]

Musically, Guitar Crusher’s style was rooted in the down-home blues of his North Carolina upbringing, filtered through the vocal intensity of postwar R&B shouters.[2][4] His recordings often featured horn-backed arrangements, call-and-response passages, and a focus on storytelling lyrics, reflecting the tradition of Southern blues singers who migrated north and reshaped their sound for club audiences. Though not a mainstream star, he carved out a durable niche in the blues world and is remembered for his raw vocal power and dedication to the classic blues idiom.[2][4]
