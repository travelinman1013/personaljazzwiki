## Biography
Mose Allison was born on November 11, 1927, in Tippo, Mississippi, in the heart of the Delta country. Raised on his grandfather’s farm, Allison’s earliest musical experiences came from listening to blues records on the jukebox at his father’s service station and taking piano lessons from age five, quickly discovering his talent for playing by ear and a preference for bluesy songs. He led a Dixieland band in high school, played trumpet, and after serving in the Army, studied English at the University of Mississippi and Louisiana State University[3][4].

Allison moved to New York City in 1956, where he launched his jazz career, performing with leading figures like Stan Getz, Gerry Mulligan, Al Cohn, and Zoot Sims[1][2]. His debut album, 'Back Country Suite' (1957), evoked the Mississippi Delta and received critical acclaim. Allison became known for his unique blend of modern jazz and blues, marked by witty, ironic lyrics and a laid-back vocal style. He formed his own trio and, by the early 1960s, was recognized as both a gifted pianist and vocalist, with songs like 'Parchman Farm' becoming standards[1][2][3].

Throughout his career, Allison’s music bridged genres and generations, influencing rock, blues, and jazz musicians alike. His songwriting, characterized by subtle humor and evocative moods, earned him a reputation as one of the finest 20th-century blues songwriters. He continued recording and performing into the 1990s, and his legacy endures through the many artists who have covered his songs and cited him as an inspiration[1][4].

- He sat in with B.B. King in Memphis several times before launching his recording career[4].
- Allison dropped his most requested song, 'Parchman Farm,' from his playlist in the 1980s, partly due to criticism over its political correctness and changing times[1].
- He was inducted into the Long Island Music Hall of Fame in 2006[1].
