## Biography
The New Birth Brass Band is a seminal New Orleans brass band founded in the mid-1980s, emerging from the city's vibrant tradition of street parades and second line celebrations. The band was formed by acclaimed trumpeter James "Twelve" Andrews and quickly distinguished itself by blending traditional brass band repertoire with contemporary influences, including funk, hip-hop, blues, soul, and gospel. This innovative approach placed New Birth at the forefront of a new wave of brass bands that followed in the stylistic footprints of the Dirty Dozen and Rebirth Brass Bands, both of which had modernized the genre by incorporating funk and R&B elements[1][2][5][6].

Throughout its history, New Birth Brass Band has been known for its virtuosic musicianship and dynamic live performances, appealing to both traditionalists and younger audiences. Key members have included tuba player Kerwin James (brother of Rebirth Brass Band's Philip and Keith Frazier), bass drummer Cayetano “Tanio” Hingle, snare drummer Kerry Hunter, and trumpeters such as Kenny Terry and Derrick Shezbie. The band has released several acclaimed albums, including 'D-Boy' (1997), 'New Birth Family' (2005), 'New Orleans Second Line' (2006), and 'On My Way' (2012)[1][2]. Their music is characterized by powerful tuba riffs, energetic rhythms, and a repertoire that ranges from classic second line tunes to inventive covers and original compositions.

New Birth Brass Band's legacy is deeply intertwined with the evolution of New Orleans brass band music. They have inspired a new generation of musicians, contributed to the genre's global popularity, and remained resilient in the face of adversity, including the loss of key members and the challenges following Hurricane Katrina. Their enduring motto, "New Birth never dies, it multiplies," reflects their ongoing influence and commitment to keeping the spirit of New Orleans brass band music alive[1][2].
