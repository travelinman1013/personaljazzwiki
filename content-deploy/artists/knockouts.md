## Biography
The Knockouts are a Swedish rock band from Stockholm that formed in 1996, founded by Johan Frandsen who started playing guitar at age six. The current lineup consists of Johan Frandsen on vocals and guitar, Kennet Stone on double bass and vocals, and Ted Jergelind on drums. Their energetic beginnings were captured with their 1998 self-titled debut 7-inch single produced by Thomas Skogsberg of The Hellacopters, followed by their promotional album 'Skyline Supernova' recorded at Sunlight Studio and released in summer 2000.

The band achieved significant success in 2010 with the release of their album 'Among the Vultures' and have built a reputation for their 'cocky punk rock' sound combined with aggressive rockabilly technique. They solidified their sound in 2003 with the addition of longtime drummer Ted Jergelind and released a self-titled EP in 2004. The Knockouts have released four studio albums and one EP compilation, performing many packed and sold-out shows across Sweden and Europe. Their success earned them national support and slots at major festivals including Hultsfred Festival, where they played alongside acts like Iggy Pop and Rocket from the Crypt.

During 2004-2006, while The Knockouts were writing material for their second album, Johan Frandsen toured over 300 dates with the internationally respected Swedish rockabilly band The GoGetters, performing across Europe and the USA, including headlining at Viva Las Vegas and supporting Stray Cats members. This extensive touring experience helped shape their sound and expanded their musical connections within the rockabilly and punk rock scenes.
