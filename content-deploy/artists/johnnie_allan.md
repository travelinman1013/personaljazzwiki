## Biography
Johnnie Allan, born John Allen Guillot on March 10, 1938, in Rayne, Louisiana, is a pioneering figure in the swamp pop genre—a blend of Cajun, country, rock and roll, and rhythm and blues. Raised in a musically rich Cajun family, Allan received his first guitar at age six and learned to play from his mother, Helen Falcon, who herself was closely connected to early Cajun recording artists. By age 13, Allan was performing with Walter Mouton and the Scott Playboys, and soon after joined Lawrence Walker and the Wandering Aces, both respected traditional Cajun bands.[1][2][3]

Allan’s musical direction shifted dramatically after witnessing Elvis Presley perform in 1956, inspiring him to incorporate rock and roll into his repertoire. In 1958, he formed the Krazy Kats, helping to shape the emerging swamp pop sound. His early recordings, such as "Lonely Days, Lonely Nights" and "Letter of Love" for Jin Records, gained regional and national attention. Throughout the 1970s and beyond, Allan balanced a career in education with his music, recording hits like his swamp pop rendition of Chuck Berry’s "Promised Land" and Merle Haggard’s "Somewhere on Skid Row." He also became a respected chronicler of Louisiana’s musical heritage, authoring books and championing the region’s cultural legacy.[1][2][3]

Allan’s influence extends internationally, with regular performances in Europe and enduring popularity among swamp pop enthusiasts. His legacy is marked by a prolific recording career—over 30 LPs and dozens of singles—and his role as both a performer and a preserver of South Louisiana’s unique musical traditions. Now retired from education, Allan continues to reside in Lafayette, Louisiana, remaining a revered figure in the Cajun and swamp pop communities.[1][2][3]
