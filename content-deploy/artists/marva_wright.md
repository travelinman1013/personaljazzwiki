## Biography
Marva Wright, born Marva Maria Williams on March 20, 1948, in New Orleans, Louisiana, emerged as one of the city's most powerful blues and gospel voices. Raised in a musical family—her mother, Mattie P. Gilbert, was a gospel singer and pianist—Wright began singing in church at age nine, often accompanied by her mother. Her early exposure to gospel music and the vibrant New Orleans music scene shaped her distinctive vocal style, blending soulful blues with gospel fervor. Despite her prodigious talent, Wright did not pursue a professional singing career until 1987, when she was nearly forty, initially performing to support her family. Her breakthrough came with a live recording of 'Mama, He Treats Your Daughter Mean' at Tipitina's in 1989, followed by her debut album 'Heartbreakin' Woman' in 1991.

Wright's career quickly gained momentum, leading to national television appearances and performances at major festivals, including the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival. Her 1993 album 'Born With The Blues' was first released in France before gaining international distribution. Known for her commanding stage presence and emotive delivery, Wright was celebrated as the 'Blues Queen of New Orleans.' She collaborated with a wide array of artists and contributed backup vocals for luminaries such as Allen Toussaint, Fats Domino, and Aaron Neville. Wright's later work, including the 2007 album 'After The Levees Broke,' reflected her resilience in the face of personal loss, notably the destruction of her home during Hurricane Katrina.

Marva Wright's legacy endures through her recordings and the indelible mark she left on the New Orleans music community. She passed away on March 23, 2010, at the age of 62, remembered for her passionate performances and her role in preserving and advancing the blues and gospel traditions of her hometown.
