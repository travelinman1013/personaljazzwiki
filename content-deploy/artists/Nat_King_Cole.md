## Biography
Nat King Cole, born Nathaniel Adams Coles on March 17, 1919, in Montgomery, Alabama, was raised in a musical family and demonstrated prodigious talent from an early age, teaching himself piano by age four. Moving to Chicago as a child, he was influenced by the city's vibrant jazz scene and began performing professionally as a teenager. In the late 1930s, Cole formed the Nat King Cole Trio in Los Angeles, a groundbreaking group noted for its drummerless format and sophisticated interplay, which helped define the sound of small-group jazz during the swing era. The trio's early hits, such as 'Straighten Up and Fly Right' and '(Get Your Kicks on) Route 66,' showcased Cole's virtuosic piano skills and smooth, understated vocal style.[1][2][4][6]

By the mid-1940s, Cole's focus shifted from jazz piano to vocal pop, and he became renowned for his velvety baritone voice and romantic ballads. Signing with Capitol Records in 1943, Cole released a string of chart-topping singles, including 'Nature Boy,' 'Mona Lisa,' and the perennial holiday favorite 'The Christmas Song.' His crossover appeal made him one of the first African American artists to achieve mainstream commercial success in the United States. In 1956, Cole broke new ground as the first African American to host a national television variety show, 'The Nat King Cole Show,' further cementing his legacy as a trailblazer in entertainment.[1][2][3][4][8]

Throughout his career, Cole recorded over 150 charting singles and became an enduring icon of vocal jazz and adult standards. He faced and challenged racial barriers, contributing to the advancement of civil rights in America. Cole's influence extended beyond his lifetime, with posthumous honors including a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award and a virtual duet with his daughter Natalie Cole on 'Unforgettable,' which introduced his artistry to new generations. He died of lung cancer on February 15, 1965, in Santa Monica, California, but his music and impact remain timeless.[1][2][3][4]
