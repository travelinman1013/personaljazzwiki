## Biography
Teddy Pendergrass, born Theodore DeReese Pendergrass on March 26, 1950, in Kingstree, South Carolina, spent most of his childhood in North Philadelphia, where he was immersed in gospel and soul music from an early age[2][4]. He began singing in church and taught himself to play drums, eventually becoming an ordained minister at age 10[6]. Pendergrass dropped out of high school to pursue music, performing with local R&B and doo-wop groups before joining Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes in 1969 as a drummer. His powerful baritone soon earned him the role of lead vocalist, and under his voice, the group achieved mainstream success with hits like “If You Don’t Know Me by Now” and “I Miss You,” working closely with producers Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff at Philadelphia International Records[1][2][4].

In 1976, frustrated with being overshadowed by the group’s founder, Pendergrass left Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes to embark on a solo career. He quickly rose to prominence, releasing five consecutive platinum albums—a record for African-American R&B artists at the time[2]. His solo hits, including “Close the Door,” “I Don’t Love You Anymore,” and “Love T.K.O.,” established him as a leading figure in the Philly soul and quiet storm genres, known for his seductive vocal style and signature “ladies only” concerts[1][2][4]. In 1982, a car accident left him paralyzed from the chest down, but he continued to record and perform, notably appearing at Live Aid in 1985 and collaborating with artists like Whitney Houston and Stephanie Mills[3][4].

Pendergrass’s legacy is marked by his influence on soul and R&B music, his crossover appeal, and his resilience in the face of adversity. He inspired contemporaries and future generations, including Luther Vandross, and remained active in music until his retirement in 2007. He passed away on January 13, 2010, in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, leaving behind a catalog of classic soul recordings and a lasting impact on the genre[2][3][4].
