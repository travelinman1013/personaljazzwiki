## Biography
Johnnie Temple was born on October 18, 1906, in Canton, Mississippi, though some sources suggest Hazlehurst, Copiah County, as his birthplace. He grew up in the Jackson, Mississippi area, where he was exposed to the vibrant blues scene. Temple learned to play the guitar and mandolin as a child and began performing at local house parties as a teenager. His early influences included notable blues musicians like Skip James, with whom he became friends. Temple's career took off in the early 1930s when he moved to Chicago and started recording. He released his biggest hit, 'Louise Louise Blues,' in 1936, followed by another notable song, 'Big Leg Woman,' in 1938. Despite his consistent record sales, Temple never achieved widespread fame. He continued to perform in Chicago and later returned to Jackson, where he played until he left the music scene to become a preacher. Temple passed away on November 22, 1968, at the age of 62.

Musically, Temple was known for his articulate singing style and fleet guitar work. He was influential in popularizing the boogie bass figure, often credited to Robert Johnson. His songs often referenced his roots in Jackson, Mississippi, and he maintained a regional style throughout his career. Temple's music was characterized by its Southern accent and pronounced vibrato, setting him apart from other contemporary blues artists.

Temple's legacy includes his contributions to the blues genre, particularly in the 1930s and 1940s. His songs have been covered by various artists, and he played a role in exposing regional blues to a broader audience. Despite his relatively low profile, Temple remains an important figure in the history of blues music.
