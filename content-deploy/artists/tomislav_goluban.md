## Biography
Tomislav “Little Pigeon” Goluban is a Croatian blues singer, harmonica player, bandleader, radio host and educator known for fusing traditional American blues with the folk sounds of his native Zagorje region. Born in a house by the railroad tracks in Grabrovec, near Zabok in northern Croatia, he still lives in the same area, deeply rooted in the landscape that shapes much of his musical identity.[2][4] He began playing harmonica in 1997, initially driven by a desire to revive country and Delta blues after spending countless hours listening to classic recordings, and he quickly developed a distinctive style that blends rural U.S. idioms with Croatian traditional music.[2]

Over the following decades Goluban emerged as one of the most prominent blues musicians in Croatia and a respected figure on the European scene. He has performed both solo/duo and with band in the United States and many European countries, including an appearance at the International Blues Challenge in Memphis, and he has won numerous European awards and placed fourth at the 2005 World Harmonica Festival.[2][5] His discography spans at least fourteen studio albums, ranging from raw Delta-style duo recordings to full-band arrangements that touch on delta, country and Chicago blues, zydeco, rock ’n’ roll and world music, all anchored by his harmonica and blues foundations.[2] Albums such as “Chicago Rambler” and “Memphis Light” underline his transatlantic approach, combining old‑school Chicago and Memphis sounds with his Croatian heritage.[2][3]

Beyond performance, Goluban is a committed advocate for the blues. He created an educational program to teach Croatian children blues harmonica, founded the Etno Blues Festival in his home region, and has long hosted a blues radio show on Croatian national radio, helping to build a domestic audience for the genre.[2][3][5] He was one of the founders and the first president of the Croatian Blues Forces association, which received the Blues Foundation’s “Keeping the Blues Alive” award in 2019, underscoring his impact as an organizer and cultural ambassador.[2] In the 2020s he further expanded his international profile through collaborations such as the transatlantic project “Nashville Road” with California guitarist and singer Crooked Eye Tommy (Tommy Marsh), a record that weaves together Croatian and West Coast U.S. blues‑rock traditions and reinforces his reputation as a bridge between scenes and styles.[1][2][6][7]

## Musical Connections

### Mentors/Influences
- [[sonny_terry|Sonny Terry]] - Primary early harmonica inspiration whose country and Delta blues recordings Goluban listened to intensively when he started playing, shaping his acoustic harp style and his mission to revive country/delta blues. (General influence from classic Sonny Terry recordings rather than a single album; cited as central to Goluban’s hours of listening when he began in 1997.) [From the late 1990s onward, especially at the start of his harmonica playing in 1997.[1][2][7]]
- [[slim_harpo|Slim Harpo]] - Stylistic blues harp influence contributing to Goluban’s approach to blues harmonica and tone, cited alongside Sonny Terry as a key model. (General influence from Slim Harpo’s recorded output; referenced as part of the legacy Goluban draws on for his blues harp sound.) [Referenced as a formative influence in his development prior to and during his recording career.[1][7]]
- [[paul_butterfield|Paul Butterfield]] - One of Goluban’s first harmonica influences, leading him into the Chess Records sound and shaping his understanding of amplified Chicago blues harp. (Influence from Paul Butterfield’s recordings and the broader Paul Butterfield Blues Band catalog associated with the Chess Records aesthetic.) [Formative listening during his early years as a harmonica player, before and during the development of his Chicago‑oriented material.[2]]
- [[chess_records_artists_via_chess_records_sound|Chess Records artists (via Chess Records sound)]] - The Chess Records sound, reached through his interest in Paul Butterfield, informed Goluban’s orientation toward classic Chicago blues production and band feel. (General influence from Chess Records catalog rather than a single title, feeding into albums like “Chicago Rambler.”) [Early 2000s onward, particularly around the period leading to his Chicago‑style album “Chicago Rambler.”[2]]
- [[velvet_underground__lou_reed|Velvet Underground / Lou Reed]] - Major impact on his general musical background during school days, before he fully engaged with blues; broadened his artistic sensibility and taste beyond traditional blues. (General influence from Velvet Underground and Lou Reed recordings that he encountered in his youth.) [School days prior to his focused turn toward blues, influencing his broader artistic outlook rather than specific blues phrasing.[2]]

### Key Collaborators
- [[crooked_eye_tommy_tommy_marsh|Crooked Eye Tommy (Tommy Marsh)]] - Key transatlantic collaborator; Goluban first featured Marsh as a guest vocalist on his 14th studio album, then co‑led the joint project “Nashville Road,” blending Croatian and West Coast U.S. blues‑rock. (Guest vocal on one track of Goluban’s 14th studio album (title not specified in sources) and full collaborative album “Nashville Road,” where Goluban handles vocals/harmonica and Marsh provides vocals, electric and acoustic guitar.) [Initial collaboration on Goluban’s 14th studio album (early 2020s) leading to the full album “Nashville Road,” released January 17, 2025.[1][2][6][7]]

### Artists Influenced
- [[croatian_blues_forces_community_and_younger_croatian_blues_musicians_collective|Croatian Blues Forces community and younger Croatian blues musicians (collective)]] - Through his roles as founder and first president of the Croatian Blues Forces association, blues educator, festival organizer, and national radio host, Goluban has shaped the Croatian blues scene and encouraged new generations of players, although specific individual protégés are not named in available sources. (Influence expressed via the Etno Blues Festival, Croatian Blues Forces activities, his blues harmonica education program for children, and his Croatian national radio blues show rather than specific recordings by protégés.)
