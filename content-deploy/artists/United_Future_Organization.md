## Biography
United Future Organization (UFO) is a pioneering Japanese acid jazz and nu jazz group formed in 1990 in Shibuya, Tokyo, Japan, by DJs Tadashi Yabe, Toshio Matsuura, and French expatriate Raphael Sebbag. The trio emerged from Tokyo’s vibrant club scene, where their eclectic DJ backgrounds and international connections helped shape a distinctive sound blending jazz, funk, hip hop, and electronic music. Their debut single, 'I Love My Baby (My Baby Loves Jazz),' released in 1991, quickly gained traction in club circuits across London, Hamburg, and New York, establishing UFO as a global presence in the underground scene.

Throughout the 1990s, UFO released a series of influential albums, including 'Jazzin’ 91-93' (1993), 'No Sound Is Too Taboo' (1994), and '3rd Perspective' (1996), each pushing the boundaries of jazz fusion with innovative sampling, live instrumentation, and a cosmopolitan sensibility. Their participation in the Red Hot Organization’s 'Stolen Moments: Red Hot + Cool' (1994) further cemented their reputation, with the album being named 'Album of the Year' by Time Magazine. UFO’s music is noted for its sophisticated arrangements, genre-blurring compositions, and the trio’s unique approach to production, often relying on tape editing and spontaneous creativity rather than traditional music theory.

A major milestone occurred in 2002 when Toshio Matsuura departed to pursue solo projects, leaving Yabe and Sebbag to continue UFO’s legacy. The group’s influence is evident in the evolution of the Shibuya-kei movement and the broader acid jazz and nu jazz genres, inspiring a generation of Japanese and international artists. Tadashi Yabe remained an active figure in the scene until his passing in July 2024, leaving behind a legacy of innovation and cross-cultural musical dialogue.

## Fun Facts
- UFO’s members often produced music without formal training in music theory, relying on their DJ skills and knowledge of tape editing to create complex arrangements.
- Their debut album was recorded with a 30-piece string ensemble at Abbey Road Studios, despite the members not being able to read sheet music.
- Tadashi Yabe was instrumental in founding the Japan Music Selector Association, aiming to legitimize the role of DJs and music selectors in Japanese society.
- The group’s contribution to 'Stolen Moments: Red Hot + Cool' placed them alongside legendary jazz and hip hop artists, and the album was named 'Album of the Year' by Time Magazine.
