## Biography
Ike & Tina Turner was an influential American musical duo formed by Ike Turner and Tina Turner, active from 1960 to 1976. Ike Turner, originally from Clarksdale, Mississippi, was a talented musician and bandleader who relocated to St. Louis, Missouri, in the mid-1950s. There, he expanded his Kings of Rhythm band and recruited Anna Mae Bullock, later known as Tina Turner, whose dynamic stage presence and powerful vocals quickly became the centerpiece of the group[1][4][8]. The duo's early years were marked by a string of R&B hits such as "A Fool In Love," "It's Gonna Work Out Fine," and "I Idolize You," establishing them as major figures on the soul and R&B circuit. Their live performances, supported by the Kings of Rhythm and the Ikettes, were renowned for their energy and showmanship, earning them a reputation as one of the most potent live acts in the genre[1][4][8].

In 1966, their collaboration with producer Phil Spector on "River Deep – Mountain High" brought international acclaim, particularly in Europe, and led to a tour with the Rolling Stones. Throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s, Ike & Tina Turner reinvented themselves with soul-infused reinterpretations of rock songs, most notably Creedence Clearwater Revival's "Proud Mary," which won them a Grammy Award in 1972. Their album "Workin' Together" and the hit "Nutbush City Limits," written by Tina, further cemented their legacy. Despite their professional success, their personal relationship was tumultuous, marked by Ike's controlling behavior and abuse, which Tina detailed in her autobiography. The duo disbanded in 1976 following their divorce, after which Tina Turner launched a highly successful solo career[1][4][8].

Ike & Tina Turner are celebrated as pioneers of soul and rock music, with over 10 million records sold and numerous accolades, including induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1991. Their innovative blend of R&B, soul, and rock influenced generations of musicians, and their singles "River Deep – Mountain High" and "Proud Mary" are enshrined in the Grammy Hall of Fame. Both Ike and Tina Turner have passed away—Tina in 2023 and Ike in 2007—but their impact on popular music endures[1][4][8].
