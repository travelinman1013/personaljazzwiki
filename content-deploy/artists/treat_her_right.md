## Biography
Treat Her Right was an American rock band formed in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1985. The original lineup featured Mark Sandman on 'low guitar' (a custom three-string instrument), Billy Conway on cocktail drum, David Champagne on guitar, and Jim Fitting on harmonica. The group was notable for its minimalist approach—members famously insisted that all their equipment could be carried in a single trip—and for their unconventional instrumentation, which set them apart from typical rock bands of the era. Their music blended elements of rock & roll, blues-rock, swamp rock, and post-punk, with a dark, bluesy edge that foreshadowed the later sound of Morphine, Sandman's subsequent band.

Treat Her Right released three studio albums between 1986 and 1991: 'Treat Her Right,' 'Tied to the Tracks,' and 'What's Good for You.' The band earned a cult following for their raw, stripped-down sound and moody songwriting, with all members except Conway contributing vocals and songwriting. After disbanding in the early 1990s, members pursued other projects: Sandman and Conway went on to form Morphine, while Fitting and Champagne remained active in the Boston music scene. The band's influence persisted, and Champagne and Fitting revived Treat Her Right in 2009 with new members, performing sporadically in the Boston area until at least 2011. Their legacy is closely tied to the evolution of alternative blues and the unique sound that Sandman later perfected in Morphine.
