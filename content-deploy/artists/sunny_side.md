## Biography
Based on the available search results, there is no artist or band with the primary name "Sunny Side" in the lo-fi hip hop genre. The search results reference "Sunny Side" only as an album title, not as an artist name. Specifically, "Sunny Side" is the fourth studio album by Virginia-based singer-songwriter Andrew Neil (born Andrew Neil Maternick), released in 2021. The album features 10 optimistic tracks with a mellower, more lo-fi folk sound, performed with Andrew's vocals and vintage nylon string Ovation acoustic guitar, accompanied on some tracks by subtle keyboard overdubs. Additionally, search results mention "Sunny Side" as one of two records by rapper Lexa Gates that convey braggadocious, introspective grind-rap ambition, but this does not establish "Sunny Side" as a standalone artist entity. The Spotify context provided (lo-fi hip hop genre, popularity score of 25) does not match any verified artist by this name in the search results.
