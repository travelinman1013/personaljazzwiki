## Biography
Kait Dunton is a Los Angeles-based jazz keyboardist, composer, and bandleader known for her expressive, genre-defying approach to modern jazz. Raised in a non-musical household, Dunton was drawn to the piano from the age of four, taking lessons throughout her youth but not initially envisioning a professional career in music. She attended the University of Virginia, majoring in Spanish, but her passion for music led her to join the school band and take numerous music classes. A pivotal moment came when her undergraduate professor, John D’earth, encouraged her to pursue music professionally, planting the seed for her future career.[1][2]

Dunton's career blossomed after moving to Los Angeles, where she became known for her work as a multi-keyboardist and for leading the acclaimed trioKAIT, a jazz trio that blends acoustic and electric sounds with inventive rhythms and emotional depth. Since her debut album 'Real & Imagined' in 2008, Dunton has released eight albums of original music, earning critical acclaim including 4.5 stars from DownBeat magazine and multiple top ten placements on the Jazz Week radio charts. She has performed at major festivals such as the Monterey Jazz Festival and contributed to film soundtracks, including 'A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood.'[2][3]

Dunton's musical style is marked by a fusion of jazz with elements of classical, pop, rock, R&B, soul, and gospel, and she is celebrated for her facility on vintage keyboards like the Fender Rhodes and Hammond B3 as well as her nuanced touch on acoustic piano. Her influences include jazz luminaries such as Richard Tee, [[01_Projects/PersonalArtistWiki/Artists/Ahmad_Jamal]], E.S.T., [[Brad_Mehldau]], Chick Corea, and Herbie Hancock. As Chair of the Piano Department at Los Angeles College of Music, Dunton continues to shape the next generation of jazz musicians, leaving a legacy of innovation, emotional connection, and genre-blending artistry.[1][2][3]
