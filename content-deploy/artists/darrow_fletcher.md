## Biography
Darrow Fletcher is an American soul singer born on January 23, 1951, in Inkster, a suburb of Detroit, Michigan, and raised on Chicago’s South Side.[1][7] Encouraged by his stepfather and mentor Johnny Haygood, he began singing as a child and was already performing locally by his early teens.[1] While still a freshman in high school, Fletcher entered the studio in December 1965 and, at just 14, recorded “The Pain Gets a Little Deeper,” which he co‑wrote with producer Ted Daniels and cut with Haygood’s support.[1] Released in early 1966, the single reached the R&B charts, drew comparisons to Frankie Lymon’s youthful heartbreak records, and quickly established him as a prodigious new voice in Chicago soul.[1][2]

Through the late 1960s and early 1970s, Fletcher recorded close to twenty singles across nine different labels, including Jacklyn, Groovy, Revue, and Crossover, building a reputation for intense, emotionally mature performances that belied his age.[1][2] He toured the chitlin’ circuit and shared bills at major venues like the Apollo Theater, the Uptown, and Chicago’s Regal with artists such as B.B. King, Stevie Wonder, The Elgins, Lee Dorsey, Jimmy Ruffin, The Capitols, and local acts like the Sharpees and Jo Ann Garrett, and appeared on regional TV shows including the Chicago version of Soul Train and Ken Hawkins’ World of Soul in Cleveland.[1] His records ranged from driving Northern soul dancers such as “The Pain Gets a Little Deeper,” “Gotta Draw the Line,” and “Changing by the Minute” to poignant ballads and socially conscious sides like “My Young Misery,” “My Judgement Day,” and “When Love Calls,” helping place him within the classic Chicago soul tradition while also appealing to later European mod and Northern soul scenes.[1][2]

In 1974 Fletcher moved to California after Ray Charles, impressed by tapes brought to him by Crossover Records A&R representative Pat Bush, financed recording sessions at his Los Angeles studio and briefly signed him, praising Fletcher’s work ethic and emotional delivery.[1] Although this collaboration did not yield major commercial success, he continued to record into the late 1970s before gradually stepping back from the music business and eventually returning first to Detroit in the early 1980s, then to Chicago around 1987, where family bereavements and the death of Haygood led to a period of depression.[1] Later involvement with the church and gospel singing, along with a revival of interest in his records among Northern soul collectors—reflected in high auction prices and reissue projects such as Ace Records’ compilation “The Pain Gets a Little Deeper: The Complete Early Years 1965–1971”—brought him renewed recognition and concert appearances in both the United States and the UK, securing his legacy as a cult favorite and “iconic soul man” for dedicated fans worldwide.[1][2]
