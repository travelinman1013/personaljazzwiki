## Biography
Ann-Margret Olsson, known professionally as Ann-Margret, was born on April 28, 1941, in Valsjöbyn, Sweden, to Anna Regina and Carl Gustav Olsson.  Her early life was spent in a small town she described as populated by "lumberjacks and farmers high up near the Arctic Circle."  After her father emigrated to the United States, the family followed in 1946, and Ann-Margret became a naturalized American citizen in 1949.  Her early interest in dance led her to the Marjorie Young School of Dance, where her natural talent and her mother's handmade costumes supported her burgeoning career.  As a teenager, she appeared on various amateur talent shows, including the Morris B. Sachs Amateur Hour, Don McNeill's Breakfast Club, and Ted Mack's Amateur Hour, continuing her theatrical pursuits while attending New Trier High School in Winnetka, Illinois.  Her early performances laid the foundation for her future success as a singer and actress.

Ann-Margret's career took off in 1961, when she gained popularity as a singer with a distinctive contralto voice.  She began recording for RCA Victor, releasing her debut album *And Here She Is ... Ann-Margret*, arranged and conducted by Marty Paich.  Subsequent albums featured collaborations with notable musicians such as Chet Atkins, the Jordanaires (Elvis Presley's backup singers), and the Anita Kerr Singers, with liner notes provided by her mentor, George Burns.  RCA Victor attempted to market her as a "female Elvis," leading her to record versions of songs like "Heartbreak Hotel."  She achieved a minor hit with "I Just Don't Understand," which reached the Billboard Top 40.  Her only charting album was *Beauty and the Beard* (1964), featuring Al Hirt.  Other career highlights included appearances on *The Jack Benny Program* and singing the *Bachelor in Paradise* theme at the Academy Awards.  Her RCA Victor contract ended in 1966, but she continued to achieve success on the dance charts in the late 1970s and early 1980s, with "Love Rush" peaking at number eight.  Later, she recorded gospel albums, *God Is Love: The Gospel Sessions* (2001) and *God is Love: The Gospel Sessions 2* (2011), earning a Grammy nomination and a Dove Award nomination.  In 2023, she released *Born to be Wild*, a classic-rock album featuring collaborations with artists such as Pat Boone, Pete Townshend, The Fuzztones, Paul Shaffer, and The Oak Ridge Boys.

Ann-Margret's musical style was characterized by a sultry, vibrant contralto voice, often compared to Elvis Presley's.  Her recordings spanned various genres, from pop and rock to gospel and Christmas music.  Her career highlights included numerous successful albums and singles, as well as memorable performances on television and in concert.  While her film career often overshadowed her musical achievements, her contributions to music remain significant, showcasing her versatility and talent.  Her enduring popularity and lasting impact on entertainment solidify her legacy as a multifaceted performer.  Her recent album, *Born to Be Wild*, demonstrates her continued relevance and passion for music.
