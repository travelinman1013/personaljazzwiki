## Biography
The Bonzo Dog Band, originally known as the Bonzo Dog Dada Band and later the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band, was formed in London in 1965 by a collective of art students drawn together by a shared love of absurdist humor, Dadaist art, and vintage jazz. The group’s founding members included Vivian Stanshall, Neil Innes, Rodney Slater, Roger Ruskin Spear, Vernon Dudley Bohay-Nowell, 'Legs' Larry Smith, and Sam Spoons. Their early performances were characterized by surreal stage antics, elaborate props, and a musical style that parodied and celebrated British music hall traditions, 1920s jazz, and novelty songs, all filtered through a lens of sharp satire and irreverence[2][3][1].

As the band evolved, they shifted from their initial focus on 'trad jazz' and comedic nostalgia to embrace elements of pop, rock, and psychedelia, producing original material that lampooned contemporary British culture. Their breakthrough came with the 1967 album 'Gorilla' and a memorable appearance in The Beatles’ 'Magical Mystery Tour' film, performing 'Death Cab for Cutie.' The Bonzos became fixtures on British television, notably on 'Do Not Adjust Your Set,' where their anarchic humor influenced a generation of comedians and musicians. Their biggest commercial success was the single 'I'm the Urban Spaceman,' produced by Paul McCartney, which reached the UK Top 5 in 1968[2][4][5].

Though the band’s original run was brief (active mainly from 1966 to 1970), their blend of musical virtuosity, surreal comedy, and cultural parody left a lasting legacy. The Bonzo Dog Band are widely credited with paving the way for acts like Monty Python and inspiring later generations of musical satirists. Members Neil Innes and Vivian Stanshall went on to notable solo careers, with Innes collaborating extensively with Monty Python and The Rutles, further cementing the Bonzos’ influence on British comedy and experimental rock[2][4].
