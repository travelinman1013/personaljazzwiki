## Biography
Charles Mingus Jr. was born on April 22, 1922, in Nogales, Arizona, and raised in the Watts section of Los Angeles, where he studied cello as a child before switching to bass at age 16 under the tutelage of a symphonic musician. Of mixed heritage including African American, Chinese, and Swedish ancestry, he faced racial discrimination but emerged as a bass prodigy, playing professionally with Louis Armstrong in 1943, Barney Bigard, and later touring with Lionel Hampton's big band from 1947 to 1948. By the early 1950s, Mingus settled in New York, recording with jazz giants like Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, Bud Powell, and Duke Ellington, while developing his unique style blending bebop, avant-garde, and collective improvisation inspired by New Orleans traditions.[1][2][3][5]

Mingus's career peaked in the mid-1950s when he co-founded Debut Records with Max Roach in 1952 to champion innovative young musicians and formed the Jazz Workshop to experiment with compositions and support emerging composers. He led groundbreaking ensembles, including a pivotal 1964 sextet featuring Dannie Richmond on drums, Jaki Byard on piano, Eric Dolphy on reeds, Johnny Coles on trumpet, and Clifford Jordan on tenor saxophone, which performed extensively and was documented in live recordings like the Jazz Workshop Concerts 1964–65. His seminal albums—Pithecanthropus Erectus (1956), Mingus Ah Um (1959), The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady (1963), and others—pioneered post-bop, progressive big band jazz, and fusions like Cumbia and Jazz Fusion (1976), emphasizing emotional depth, unconventional structures, and group interplay over rigid notation.[1][2][3][4]

Mingus's legacy as a virtuoso bassist, composer, bandleader, and pianist endures through over 100 albums and 300 scores, influencing jazz's evolution toward greater experimentation and social commentary. Despite battling amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in his final years, he continued performing until his death on January 5, 1979, in Cuernavaca, Mexico, leaving works like 'Goodbye Pork Pie Hat' and 'Half-Mast Inhibition' (premiered in 1955) as cornerstones of modern jazz composition.[1][2][5]
