## Biography
Joaquim de Magalhães Fernandes Barreiros, professionally known as Quim Barreiros, was born on June 19, 1947, in Vila Praia de Âncora, a coastal town in northern Portugal. He began his musical journey at a young age, learning the accordion at 8 and joining his father's band, Conjunto Alegria, as a drummer by age 9, later transitioning to accordion. After performing in various dance bands and a folklore group, he joined the Portuguese Air Force in 1968, playing with its band until 1974. His first LP, 'Quim Barreiros – Acordeão,' was released in 1971, followed by 'Povo Que Canta' in 1974, both featuring Portuguese folk classics.

Barreiros soon developed his signature style, writing original songs filled with playful double entendres and risqué humor, which became hallmarks of the 'pimba' genre—a uniquely Portuguese blend of traditional folk, accordion, and cheeky lyrics. His energetic live performances and humorous songs, such as 'A Cabritinha,' 'A Garagem da Vizinha,' and 'Bacalhau à Portuguesa,' made him a staple at festivals and student events across Portugal and among Portuguese communities abroad. Over a career spanning more than five decades, he has released over twenty albums and is celebrated as the 'King of Pimba,' a cultural icon whose music is inseparable from the spirit of Portuguese popular festivities, especially the Santos Populares.

Barreiros' legacy lies in his ability to unite generations through music that is both entertaining and deeply rooted in Portuguese tradition. His influence on the pimba genre has helped shape a significant part of Portugal’s cultural identity, making him one of the country's most beloved and enduring musical figures.
