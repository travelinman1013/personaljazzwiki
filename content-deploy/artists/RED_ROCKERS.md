## Biography
Red Rockers were a New Orleans-based band formed in 1979 by John Thomas Griffith, James Singletary, and Darren Hill, who bonded over a shared passion for the burgeoning punk movement. Initially performing as the Rat Finks and covering songs by the Sex Pistols, the Clash, and Stiff Little Fingers, the group soon shifted to original material, inspired by their political views and personal experiences as young Americans during the Reagan era. Their debut album, 'Condition Red' (1981), was a raw, left-wing punk statement that earned them the moniker 'the American Clash.'

After relocating to Los Angeles and signing with 415 Records, Red Rockers evolved their sound, embracing a more melodic new wave and jangle pop style. This shift culminated in their 1983 hit 'China,' which reached #19 on the U.S. Mainstream Rock chart and received regular MTV airplay. Their subsequent albums, including 'Good as Gold' and 'Schizophrenic Circus,' showcased a broader pop sensibility, but the band ultimately disbanded in 1985. Despite their brief run, Red Rockers are remembered as pioneers who bridged punk’s political urgency with the accessible hooks of early '80s new wave.
