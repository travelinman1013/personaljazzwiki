## Biography
Sun Ra & His Arkestra, founded in the mid-1950s by the visionary composer, pianist, and bandleader Sun Ra (born Herman Poole Blount in Birmingham, Alabama), is one of the most influential and enigmatic ensembles in jazz history. Sun Ra, a child prodigy and early jazz innovator, began his career in Chicago, working as a sideman and arranger before forming his own group, initially called the Space Trio, which evolved into the Arkestra. The group became known for its ever-changing lineup, elaborate stage performances featuring costumes and cosmic themes, and a relentless commitment to musical innovation, blending swing, bebop, free jazz, and electronic music with non-Western influences and avant-garde experimentation.[1][3][4][6]

Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Sun Ra & His Arkestra were at the forefront of the free jazz and avant-garde movements, pioneering the concept of Afrofuturism by merging African-American cultural heritage with science fiction and mysticism. The Arkestra's performances were legendary for their theatricality, featuring dancers, singers, and light shows, and their music ranged from tightly arranged big band charts to wild, collective improvisations. After relocating to Philadelphia in 1968, the group continued to evolve, maintaining a rigorous rehearsal and touring schedule and releasing a prolific number of recordings, many on their own Saturn label.[1][2][3][4]

Following Sun Ra's death in 1993, the Arkestra has continued under the direction of key members, notably saxophonists John Gilmore and later Marshall Allen, preserving and expanding Sun Ra's legacy. The group remains active, performing internationally and inspiring generations of musicians with their boundary-pushing artistry and commitment to creative freedom.[1][2][3]

## Fun Facts
- Sun Ra claimed he was from Saturn, not Earth, and developed an elaborate cosmic philosophy that shaped the Arkestra's music and performances.
- The Arkestra lived communally in a Philadelphia rowhouse known as the Arkestral Institute, which doubled as their rehearsal space and creative hub.
- Sun Ra was one of the first jazz musicians to use electronic keyboards and synthesizers, including the Minimoog, in live performance.
- The Arkestra's discography is vast and often confusing, with albums released under various names and on their own Saturn label, making them a favorite subject for collectors.
