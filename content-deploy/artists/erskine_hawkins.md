## Biography
Erskine Ramsay Hawkins (July 26, 1914 – November 11, 1993) was an influential American trumpeter, composer, and big band leader born in Birmingham, Alabama. Nicknamed 'The 20th Century Gabriel' for his dazzling trumpet technique and ability to hit high notes, Hawkins began his musical journey as a drummer at age seven, then moved to trombone, and finally settled on trumpet at thirteen. He attended Alabama State Teachers College in Montgomery, where he led the college band, the 'Bama State Collegians. In 1934, Hawkins and his band traveled to New York City, where their energetic performances at the Savoy Ballroom led to professional success and the evolution of the group into the Erskine Hawkins Orchestra.

Hawkins' orchestra became a staple of the swing era, recording hits such as the jazz standard 'Tuxedo Junction' (1939), co-written with Bill Johnson and Julian Dash. The band's signature sound featured a strong, swinging rhythm section and showcased Hawkins' flamboyant trumpet solos. The orchestra was especially popular among African American audiences and maintained a loyal following through the 1940s and into the early 1950s, outlasting many other big bands as musical tastes shifted. Hawkins' later work leaned more toward rhythm and blues, and he continued performing and recording into his seventies.

His legacy includes not only his own recordings but also his role in discovering and nurturing talented musicians who passed through his orchestra. Hawkins was inducted into both the Alabama Music Hall of Fame and the Alabama Jazz Hall of Fame, and his influence is recognized in the enduring popularity of 'Tuxedo Junction' and his impact on future generations of jazz and R&B musicians.
