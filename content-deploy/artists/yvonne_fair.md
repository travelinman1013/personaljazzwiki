## Biography
Flora Yvonne Coleman, known professionally as **Yvonne Fair**, was born on October 21, 1942 in Richmond, Virginia, and grew up partly in the Bronx, New York.[1][5] Raised in the church and drawn early to rhythm and blues, she left school in her teens and initially married Leroy Fair, from whom she took the surname she would keep onstage.[1][6] Fair idolized powerhouse vocalists such as Etta James, shaping her own style around gritty, gospel-inflected soul singing and an extroverted stage presence that soon made her a draw on the club and revue circuit.[5]  

Her professional break came in the early 1960s when she joined **James Brown’s revue** and became one of his protégées, touring extensively and recording several singles with the James Brown Band for King Records, including “I Found You” (1962), a song Brown later reworked into his smash hit “I Got You (I Feel Good)”.[1] Between 1962 and 1966 she cut at least five singles for King, followed by stints with Smash and Soul Records in the late 1960s as she continued honing a hard-edged, emotive soul style.[1] In the early 1970s she signed with **Motown**, appeared (and sang) in the Diana Ross film *Lady Sings the Blues* (1972), and worked closely with producer Norman Whitfield on singles such as “Love Ain’t No Toy”, “Walk Out the Door If You Wanna”, and a fiery version of “Funky Music Sho’ Nuff Turns Me On”.[1] Her sole Motown album, *The Bitch Is Black* (1975), yielded her signature hit, a dramatic cover of “It Should Have Been Me” that reached the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 in 1976 and rose to No. 5 on the UK charts, cementing her reputation among soul and Northern soul audiences.[1]  

Fair’s music blended **classic soul**, gospel shouts, and the orchestral funk of Whitfield-era Motown, delivered with theatrical humor and blistering emotional intensity that made her a favorite onstage even if mainstream chart success was limited.[1][4] She continued to perform into the 1980s, and her recordings later found renewed life on the UK Northern soul scene and in film and television soundtracks, introducing her to new generations of listeners.[1][2][4] In her personal life she married singer Sammy Strain of Little Anthony & the Imperials and later The O’Jays, and had two children, including daughter Venisha Brown with James Brown.[1][2] Yvonne Fair died in Las Vegas, Nevada, on March 6, 1994, at the age of 51, leaving behind a compact but influential body of work revered by soul collectors for its raw power and attitude.[1][2]

## Fun Facts
- Her 1962 single “I Found You” with the James Brown Band provided the basis for James Brown’s classic hit “I Got You (I Feel Good)”, one of the most recognizable soul songs of all time.[1]
- Her biggest hit, the fiery breakup anthem “It Should Have Been Me”, was actually a cover of a song previously recorded by Kim Weston and Gladys Knight, yet Fair’s version became the one that stormed the UK Top 5 in 1976.[1]
- Her lone Motown album was provocatively titled *The Bitch Is Black*, a bold statement in 1975 that matched her reputation as a no‑nonsense, high‑drama performer.[1]
- She had a daughter, Venisha Brown, with James Brown; Venisha later became publicly known in her own right as part of the extended Brown family, highlighting Fair’s close personal ties to one of soul music’s most iconic figures.[1][2]
