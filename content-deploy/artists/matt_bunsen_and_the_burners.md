## Biography
Matt Bunsen, originally known as Matt Silbert, emerged from the Boston music scene in the 1990s and early 2000s as the bassist for the well-known band Seks Bomba, establishing his foundation in rock and alternative sounds.[4] Relocating to Los Angeles, he transitioned into a singer-songwriter career, forming the Americana band Matt Bunsen & The Burners, where he performs frequently as a bassist on electric and upright, alongside vocals and songwriting.[1][7] His songwriting explores themes of drugs, enlightenment, emotional baggage, and storytelling, often blending humor with introspection, as evident in his 2023 release 'I Am Consumed,' his fourth album.[1][3][6]

Bunsen's musical style spans classic rock, classic funk, traditional jazz, jamband, instrumental rockers, and comedy, with a penchant for righteous 60s covers and songs originally by female vocalists.[1][5] He gigs regularly in and around Los Angeles, both solo and with his band, showcasing versatility across instruments like bass, guitar, and synth.[1][2] Projects like the instrumental odyssey featuring collaborators highlight his compositional range.[2]

Though not yet widely recognized beyond local scenes, Bunsen's persistent output and live performances contribute to a niche legacy in LA's Americana and rock circuits, with 'I Am Consumed' marking a recent milestone in his evolving catalog.[3][6]
