## Biography
Leon Pinson, born January 11, 1919, in Union County, Mississippi, faced significant challenges early in life when a case of meningitis left him partially crippled and almost blind. Despite these disabilities, his musical talent shone through as a guitarist and pianist, enabling him to pursue music in rural Mississippi. Beginning in 1929, he traveled northern Mississippi alongside harmonica player Elder Roma Wilson, building a reputation performing down-home gospel music.[1][2][3][4]

Pinson's career centered on gospel performances, often in partnership with Wilson, whom he met as a musical companion in the late 1920s. The duo's collaboration extended into later decades, reactivating in 1989 after a chance reunion, showcasing their enduring musical bond rooted in Mississippi's Delta traditions. His style blended country blues and ragtime elements with gospel, reflecting the raw, spiritual sounds of the region, though he remained largely obscure outside niche folk and blues circles.[2][3][5][6]

Pinson lived much of his life in the Mississippi Delta and passed away on October 10, 1998. His legacy endures through preserved recordings and interviews, such as those from the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, highlighting his resilience and contributions to down-home gospel amid personal hardships.[1][2][5]
