## Biography
Jimmie Noone's Apex Club Orchestra was an influential Chicago jazz ensemble led by clarinetist Jimmie Noone, who was born on April 23, 1895, in Cut Off, Louisiana, and died on April 19, 1944.[2] Noone began his musical career in New Orleans, where he studied clarinet with Lorenzo Tio and the young Sidney Bechet at age 15, eventually switching from guitar.[2] He gained early professional experience playing with prominent New Orleans bandleaders including Freddie Keppard, Buddy Petit, Kid Ory, and Papa Celestin before joining Keppard's Original Creole Orchestra in 1917.[1][2] When the Storyville district closed in 1917, Noone relocated to Chicago, where he worked with Doc Cook's band from 1920 to 1926, establishing himself as one of the finest clarinetists of the 1920s.[1][2]

In 1926, Noone formed his own group at Chicago's Apex Club, creating Jimmie Noone's Apex Club Orchestra, which became notable for its innovative and unusual instrumentation for the era.[1][2] The quintet featured Noone on clarinet, alto saxophonist Joe Poston, piano, guitar, and drums, with tuba added in mid-1928.[1] This ensemble was remarkable for preserving New Orleans musical concepts without using brass instruments, creating a bridge between traditional New Orleans jazz and emerging swing styles.[2] The band's most celebrated recordings occurred in 1928-1929, featuring pianist Earl Hines, whose virtuosic right-hand playing and trumpet-style solos complemented Noone's clarinet work.[1][3] These recordings, including classics like "Sweet Lorraine," "Apex Blues," and "Four or Five Times," are considered Noone's finest works and represent a crucial transition in jazz history.[3]

The Apex Club Orchestra remained active until Prohibition violations forced the venue to close in 1929, though Noone continued recording prolifically through the 1930s with various record labels including Vocalion and Decca.[1][2] Unlike many Chicago jazz musicians of the era, Noone chose to remain in Chicago rather than relocate to New York, maintaining his distinctive style while adapting to jazz's evolution.[1] In 1943, he moved to Los Angeles, where he performed with various ensembles and made his only film appearance, playing "Apex Blues" and "Boogie Woogie" with a quartet.[1] Though largely forgotten outside hardcore traditional jazz circles today, Noone's Apex Club Orchestra recordings remain influential examples of early jazz innovation and the transition from New Orleans ensemble playing to modern swing.
