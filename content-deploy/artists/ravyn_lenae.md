## Biography
Ravyn Lenae Washington (born January 22, 1999) is an American singer and songwriter from Chicago’s South Side, known for a distinctive blend of alternative R&B, neo‑soul, and experimental pop.[1][2] Raised in the Pullman neighborhood in a Christian Reformed family, she grew up singing in church, where her grandfather pastored for three decades, and began writing songs in middle school.[2] Her mother is from Panama, and Lenae has cited both her family’s musical background—her grandfather once sang in a doo‑wop group—and her parents’ eclectic tastes in R&B, soul, and hip‑hop as early influences.[2][5][6] She attended the Chicago High School for the Arts, focusing on classical vocal training, opera, and music theory, which helped shape her precise, agile voice and broadened her understanding of how the voice can function as an instrument.[2][4][5]

As a high‑school sophomore, Lenae paid for her first studio session, resulting in her debut single “Greetings,” which quickly gained attention in Chicago and led to a deal with Three Twenty Three Music Group and later Atlantic Records.[1][2][4] She released her first EP, *Moon Shoes*, independently in 2015 (reissued by Atlantic in 2016), followed by the more romantic, atmospheric *Midnight Moonlight* in 2017, projects that established her as a rising voice in alternative R&B.[1][2][3][4] Around the same time, she helped form the Zero Fatigue collective with producer Monte Booker and rapper Smino, appeared on tracks by Chicago peers such as Mick Jenkins, and toured nationally opening for Noname and later SZA on the *Telefone* and *Ctrl* tours, respectively.[1][2][4] In 2018 she released *Crush*, an EP produced entirely by Steve Lacy that showcased a more sensual, funk‑inflected direction, and in 2022 she issued her debut album *Hypnos* on Atlantic, featuring collaborations with Monte Booker, Steve Lacy, KAYTRANADA, Smino, Fousheé, and others, earning critical praise for its dreamy production and intricate, feather‑light vocal performances.[1][7][8]

Lenae’s music is marked by ethereal falsetto, jazz‑tinged harmonies, and unconventional song structures that reflect her classical training and wide‑ranging inspirations, from India.Arie and Lauryn Hill to OutKast and Baroque composers like Vivaldi and Reynaldo Hahn.[5][6][7] Critics have highlighted her “smooth vocals” and poetic lyricism, her willingness to experiment with house, bedroom pop, and electronic textures, and her ability to convey intimacy and emotional nuance without vocal excess.[2][3][4] Though still in the early stages of her career, she has become a key figure in a new generation of Chicago‑rooted, genre‑blurring R&B artists, helping to expand the sonic palette of contemporary soul while maintaining a strong connection to community, collaboration, and formal musicianship.[1][2][7][8]
