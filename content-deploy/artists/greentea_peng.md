## Biography
Aria Wells, known professionally as Greentea Peng, was born in December 1994 in Bermondsey, South London, England, to an actor father and an African mother. Growing up in London, she discovered music through her father's influence, performing in school, church choir, and creating 'funky house tunes' as a child. After her parents' separation at age 12, she moved to Hastings, faced bullying, quit music by 15, left school early, and at 17 returned to London for nightlife jobs and partying amid depression and drug use. A transformative trip to Tulum, Mexico, around 2015–2016—working at a yoga retreat, joining local band Los Hedonistas, and meeting manager KESH—renewed her passion for music.[1][2][3]
