## Biography
Nicola de Brun is the pseudonym of Klaus Brüngel, a German composer and bass player born on October 2, 1949, in Holzwickede, a town near Dortmund in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany.[1][2] Working under his adopted stage name, Brüngel has established himself as a classical and orchestral composer with a distinctive approach to musical storytelling. His compositional work is characterized by programmatic music that translates literary and mythological narratives into instrumental form, demonstrating a deep engagement with classical traditions and narrative-driven composition.

Brüngel's most notable contribution to contemporary classical music is his extensive cycle of orchestral works based on Homer's Odyssey, which comprises 46 musical representations of the characters and places featured in the ancient epic.[4] This ambitious project showcases his ability to transform literary material into cohesive musical narratives, with works such as the Odyssey Suite Vol. 1 for Orchestra being published and distributed through major music retailers.[6] His compositional output also includes ballet music and piano exercises, demonstrating versatility across different musical genres and instrumental combinations. Though maintaining a relatively low profile in mainstream music circles, Brüngel's work represents a significant contribution to contemporary classical composition, particularly in the realm of programmatic orchestral music.
