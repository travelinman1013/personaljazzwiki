## Biography
Aziza Mustafa Zadeh is an Azerbaijani jazz pianist and singer born in Baku to renowned musical parents Vagif and Elza Mustafa Zadeh. Her extraordinary musical sensitivity was evident from infancy—at just eight months old, her parents discovered she would cry when her father played the melancholic mugham mode "Shur" and dance joyfully when he switched to the uplifting "Rast" mode. She made her stage debut at age three, improvising vocals with her father, and began studying classical piano at an early age with special interest in Bach and Chopin while developing a remarkable talent for improvisation. Tragedy struck when her father died of a heart attack in 1979 at age 39, prompting her mother Elza to give up her own singing career to nurture Aziza's musical development.

At 18, Aziza's mugam-influenced jazz style earned her third place in the 1988 Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz piano competition in Washington, D.C., alongside American Matt Cooper. She moved to Germany with her mother around this time and released her debut album "Aziza Mustafa Zadeh" in 1991, showcasing influences from Chick Corea and Keith Jarrett blended with Near Eastern music. Her second album "Always" won her the prestigious Phono Academy Prize and Echo Prize from Sony, establishing her as a significant voice in contemporary jazz. She has since performed internationally with numerous jazz and traditional musicians, releasing multiple albums with her most recent being "Generations" in 2020.

Aziza currently resides in Mainz, Germany with her mother, who also serves as her manager. Her unique musical style, which she describes as incorporating mugam—traditional Azerbaijani folk music—into jazz improvisation, has created a distinctive sound that bridges Eastern and Western musical traditions. Beyond music, she enjoys painting and considers it one of her favorite leisure activities alongside sleeping. She maintains a spiritual belief in God while not identifying with any particular organized religion.
