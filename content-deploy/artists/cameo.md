## Biography
Cameo is an influential American funk band formed in 1974 in New York City by Larry Blackmon, originally under the name New York City Players. The group started as a 14-member ensemble with a horn-driven sound, drawing early comparisons to Parliament-Funkadelic for their energetic stage presence and boundary-pushing funk style. After a legal dispute over their original name, they adopted 'Cameo,' inspired by a Canadian cigarette brand. Their debut album, 'Cardiac Arrest,' released in 1977, featured the hit 'Rigor Mortis' and established their reputation for infectious grooves and dancefloor appeal.

Throughout the late 1970s and 1980s, Cameo evolved musically, incorporating elements of pop, hip hop, rock, and reggae while maintaining their funk roots. The band's lineup fluctuated, but Larry Blackmon remained the creative force and iconic frontman, known for his distinctive red codpiece and charismatic performances. Major hits like 'Word Up!,' 'Candy,' and 'She's Strange' propelled Cameo to mainstream success, with 'Word Up!' reaching number one on the Billboard R&B chart and crossing over to pop audiences. Their innovative use of synthesizers and drum machines helped modernize funk for a new generation.

Cameo's legacy endures as pioneers who bridged classic funk with contemporary R&B and hip hop. Their influence can be heard in the work of numerous later artists, and their music continues to be sampled and celebrated. Despite changes in the music industry and shifting group membership, Cameo remains active, touring and inspiring audiences with their enduring funk sound.
