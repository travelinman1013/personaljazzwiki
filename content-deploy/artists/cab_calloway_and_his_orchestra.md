## Biography
Cabell 'Cab' Calloway III was born on December 25, 1907, in Rochester, New York, and emerged as one of the most dynamic and influential figures of the jazz age. After his family relocated to Baltimore when he was 11 years old, Calloway pursued law studies in Chicago following his high school graduation in 1927. However, the allure of music proved irresistible, and he began performing at Chicago's Sunset Café, where he met Louis Armstrong, who became his mentor in the art of scat singing—a technique that would become Calloway's signature. In 1928, Calloway formed a band called 'The Missourians' and relocated to New York City the following year, where his career would reach unprecedented heights.

Calloway's rise to stardom accelerated in 1930 when he was hired to replace Duke Ellington at the legendary Cotton Club in Harlem. His extraordinary stage presence, characterized by flamboyant zoot suits, dynamic dance moves, and exuberant performance style, distinguished him from other bandleaders of his era who typically conducted with a simple baton. By age 23, Calloway had become the Cotton Club's star attraction, leading what became known as the Cab Calloway Orchestra for more than a decade. The orchestra recorded prolifically across multiple labels including Brunswick, Victor, Vocalion, and OKeh Records from 1930 through the 1940s. His 1931 recording of 'Minnie the Moocher' became his most famous composition, showcasing his masterful scat singing and selling over a million copies.

Calloway's legacy extended far beyond music into entertainment and cultural pioneering. He became the first African American to host a nationally syndicated radio show and the first African American to publish a dictionary, which was printed in six editions. His orchestra served as a launching pad for numerous jazz legends, and his flamboyant personality led to acting roles in Broadway productions and films including 'The Blues Brothers' and 'The Cincinnati Kid.' The Cab Calloway Orchestra remained one of the most important jazz bands in America throughout the swing era, and his influence on jazz performance and showmanship continues to resonate. Calloway passed away on November 18, 1994, in Hockessin, Delaware, leaving behind an indelible mark on American music and culture.
