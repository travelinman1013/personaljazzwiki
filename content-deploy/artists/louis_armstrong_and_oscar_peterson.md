## Biography
Louis Armstrong Meets Oscar Peterson is not a musical artist or band, but rather a collaborative studio album released in late 1959 by two legendary jazz musicians: Louis Armstrong and Oscar Peterson. The album was recorded across two sessions in 1957 at Capitol Studios in Hollywood—on July 31 and October 14—but was not released until shortly before Christmas 1959, two years after the initial recordings. This project brought together two titans of jazz: Armstrong, one of the most innovative, singular, and beloved artists of the 20th century known for his revolutionary vocal style and trumpet playing, and Peterson, Verve Records' legendary "house pianist" renowned for his exceptional skills as both a pianist and leader. The collaboration resulted in a dozen tracks featuring Armstrong performing standards that were not part of his usual repertoire, presented in an unadorned setting that allowed his artistry to shine without excessive production elements. The album was produced by impresario Norman Granz under the Verve Records label and has since become recognized as a significant work in jazz history, demonstrating the musical kinship between two generational talents.

## Fun Facts
- The album was recorded in 1957 but not released until late 1959, a two-year gap between recording and commercial release.
- The 1997 CD reissue included four bonus tracks from the same recording sessions, including two songs that were previously only available on compilations: 'Indiana' and an alternate take of 'Let's Fall in Love.'
- Jazz critic Leonard Feather praised the album's stripped-down approach, noting that 'Hearing Louis in the unfrilled, ungimmicked setting of the Oscar Peterson rhythm section' would be a treat for those who appreciated Armstrong's artistry without excessive production.
- The album features Armstrong performing primarily as a vocalist with occasional trumpet solos limited to single choruses in most cases, showcasing his 'totally personal and thoroughly captivating vocal style' rather than his typical instrumental prominence.
