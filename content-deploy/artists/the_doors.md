## Biography
The Doors were an American rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1965, emerging as one of the most influential and controversial acts of the 1960s counterculture movement.[1][3] The group originated from a chance meeting between Jim Morrison and Ray Manzarek on Venice Beach in July 1965, when the two UCLA film school students recognized each other and discovered a shared creative vision.[1][3] Morrison, who had been writing songs and poetry, found the perfect musical partner in Manzarek, a classically trained keyboardist whose left-hand bass lines would become a signature element of the band's sound.[1] By August 1965, they recruited drummer John Densmore from meditation classes and later guitarist Robby Krieger, completing the classic lineup that would define the band's era.[3] Taking their name from Aldous Huxley's book *The Doors of Perception*—itself derived from William Blake's poetry—the band developed their distinctive blues-rock style influenced by 1960s California psychedelia during residencies at local clubs like the London Fog and the Whisky a Go Go.[1][3]

After signing with Elektra Records in August 1966, The Doors released their self-titled debut album in January 1967, which immediately established them as fully formed artists capable of both commercial success and avant-garde experimentation.[1][2] The album featured iconic hits including "Light My Fire," which reached number one on the charts, alongside the provocative "Break on Through (to the Other Side)," "Back Door Man," and the visionary masterpiece "The End."[1][2] Before the year ended, they released the ambitious follow-up *Strange Days*, demonstrating their rapid creative evolution.[1] Over five years, the band recorded six studio albums with Elektra Records, several of which are considered among the greatest rock albums of all time, including *Morrison Hotel* (1970) and *L.A. Woman*.[3] However, their trajectory was marked by controversy—Morrison's provocative lyrics, erratic stage persona, and legal issues made them simultaneously celebrated and condemned, while their theatrical performance techniques and refusal to be "mere entertainers" challenged audiences and redefined the relationship between rock musicians and their fans.[1][3]

Jim Morrison's untimely death in 1971 effectively ended The Doors' original run, though the surviving members—Manzarek, Krieger, and Densmore—reunited briefly in 1978 to record music accompanying Morrison's poetry readings for *An American Prayer*.[1] The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993, cementing their legacy as architects of psychedelic rock and counterculture icons.[3] Following Morrison's death and subsequent legal disputes over the band's name, Manzarek and Krieger continued performing under various names including "The Doors of the 21st Century" (2002) and eventually "Manzarek–Krieger," touring until Manzarek's death in 2013.[3] Morrison remains the template of the rock frontman, and The Doors' influence continues to inspire artists and audiences worldwide, their music representing a pivotal moment when rock music became a vehicle for artistic ambition, social commentary, and spiritual exploration.[1]

## Fun Facts
- The Doors were fired from the Whisky a Go Go after just three months of performances in 1966 for shocking audiences with loud music and sexually taboo language, an incident that paradoxically helped establish their rebellious reputation.[2]
- Jim Morrison initially had no intention of being a singer; he was invited to join Ray Manzarek's existing band 'Rick and the Ravens' solely on the strength of his poetry, which led to the formation of The Doors.[1]
- The band recorded their iconic six-song demo on September 2, 1965, at World Pacific Studios with bass player Patty Sullivan, before Robby Krieger officially joined the group in late 1965.[3]
- John Densmore, the band's drummer, was recruited from meditation classes he attended with Ray Manzarek, demonstrating how the band's formation was shaped by chance encounters and shared spiritual interests rather than traditional music industry connections.[3]
