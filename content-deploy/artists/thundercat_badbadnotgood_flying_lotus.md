## Biography
Stephen Lee Bruner, known professionally as Thundercat, was born on October 19, 1984, in Los Angeles, California. Raised in a highly musical family—his father, Ronald Bruner Sr., was a renowned drummer, and his mother, Pam, played flute and percussion—Thundercat began playing bass at an early age, drawing inspiration from jazz and funk legends like Stanley Clarke and Marcus Miller. By age 15, he had already achieved early success in Germany with the boy band No Curfew, and soon after joined his brother Ronald Jr. in the influential crossover thrash band Suicidal Tendencies, establishing his reputation as a prodigious bassist.[1][2][5]

Thundercat's career evolved rapidly as he became a sought-after collaborator, working with artists such as Kamasi Washington, Erykah Badu, Snoop Dogg, and most notably, Kendrick Lamar—contributing significantly to the landmark album 'To Pimp a Butterfly.' Encouraged by producer Flying Lotus, Thundercat launched his solo career with the album 'The Golden Age of Apocalypse' (2011), followed by 'Apocalypse' (2013), 'Drunk' (2017), and 'It Is What It Is' (2020), the latter earning him a Grammy Award for Best Progressive R&B Album. His music is celebrated for its genre-blending fusion of funk, soul, jazz, psychedelia, and progressive R&B, and his virtuosic bass playing has made him one of the most influential musicians of his generation.[1][2][3]

Thundercat's legacy is marked by his role in redefining modern bass and contemporary music, both as a solo artist and as a collaborator. His innovative approach and willingness to push musical boundaries have inspired a new generation of artists, and his work continues to be recognized for its creativity, technical mastery, and emotional depth.[1][2][3]
