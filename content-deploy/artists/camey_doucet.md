## Biography
Camey Joseph Doucet, born April 4, 1939, in Crowley, Louisiana, emerged as a pivotal figure in Cajun music and broadcasting. His early career began by lending equipment to radio station KAJN, leading to his role as a French-language disc jockey there, followed by stints at KSIG, KLVI in Texas, and KROF in Abbeville. As a musician rooted in **Cajun** and **zydeco** traditions, Doucet recorded numerous singles, five albums, and a CD, many on Swallow Records, blending heartfelt ballads and humorous tunes in French and English to preserve Acadiana's cultural heritage.[1][3][6]

Doucet's signature song, “Mom, I’m Still Your Little Boy” (and its French version “Je Suis Toujours Ton ’tit Garçon”), became a regional anthem capturing familial love and Cajun sincerity, while tracks like “Who Stole the Pies” showcased his playful charm. His dual career in radio and music amplified Cajun stories, language, and rhythms, shaping generations through broadcasts and performances with major names in the genre.[1][5]

His enduring legacy includes multiple hall of fame inductions, such as the CFMA Hall of Fame (1997, inaugural class), Louisiana Music Hall of Fame (1991), Mamou Cajun Music Festival Hall of Fame (2018), and recognition as a Living Legend by the Acadian Museum (2010), alongside a 2025 Louisiana Legislature resolution honoring his cultural contributions.[1][2][3]
