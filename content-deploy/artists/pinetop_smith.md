## Biography
Clarence 'Pinetop' Smith was born on June 11, 1904, in Troy, Alabama, and raised in Birmingham. A self-taught pianist, he began performing at local house parties and public venues in his mid-teens, quickly developing a distinctive style that blended blues, ragtime, and early jazz. His early career saw him move to Pittsburgh in 1920, where he worked as an entertainer and toured the Theatre Owners Booking Association (T.O.B.A.) vaudeville circuit, performing as a singer, comedian, and pianist. He also served as an accompanist for notable blues artists such as Ma Rainey and Butterbeans & Susie. In 1928, encouraged by fellow pianist Cow Cow Davenport, Smith relocated to Chicago to record for Vocalion Records, where he lived in the same rooming house as boogie-woogie legends Meade Lux Lewis and Albert Ammons, fostering a vibrant musical exchange.

Smith's musical style was characterized by rhythmic 'breaks' and a driving, danceable piano technique that became foundational to the boogie-woogie genre. His 1928 recording of 'Pinetop's Boogie Woogie' was the first known use of the term 'boogie woogie' on a record and helped cement the genre's identity. Tragically, Smith's promising career was cut short when he was fatally shot in a dance-hall fight in Chicago on March 15, 1929, the night before a scheduled recording session. Despite his brief career, Smith's influence on boogie-woogie and subsequent genres like rock and roll was profound, and his work gained renewed popularity after World War II through covers by artists such as Tommy Dorsey, Bing Crosby, and Count Basie.
