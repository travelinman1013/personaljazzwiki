## Biography
The Five Harmaniacs were a short‑lived **novelty jug band** active on the U.S. vaudeville circuit in the mid‑1920s, remembered today primarily through a handful of recordings for the Victor label.[2] Contemporary accounts describe them as having a “short‑lived but apparently successful run on vaudeville,” suggesting that, while their career peak was brief, they were a working professional act with enough visibility to secure major‑label releases in an era when many jug and skiffle‑type groups remained undocumented.[2]

Stylistically, the Five Harmaniacs sat at the crossroads of **ragtime, early jazz, and jug‑band novelty music**, using the characteristic mix of homemade and conventional instruments to deliver light, humorous material.[2] Their 78 rpm record Victor 20293, coupling “Sadie Green, Vamp of New Orleans” with “Coney Island Washboard,” was recorded on December 17, 1926 and captures their blend of rhythmic drive and comic flair.[1][2] Later commentators have cited their 1926 recording of “Coney Island Washboard” as the clear model for 1960s revival versions by the Jim Kweskin Jug Band, underscoring the group’s long‑range impact on the folk and jug‑band revival movement despite their limited discography.[3] Because few biographical details survive and no dedicated reference entry or archival biography is currently available, modern understanding of the Five Harmaniacs rests almost entirely on discographical data, surviving 78s, and occasional references in scholarship on early jug bands and reissue notes.[2][4]

Within the larger history of American popular music, the Five Harmaniacs occupy a niche but important place as one of only a small number of **country/novelty jug bands** to be recorded in the 1920s for a national company, later resurfacing on reissue series that surveyed early African American and vernacular musics.[2][4] Their recordings circulate today among collectors and historians of old‑time, jug band, and early country blues, and they continue to appear on specialist playlists and blogs that document the intersection of ragtime, jazz, and old‑time string band traditions.[1][2][5][6] Although individual member names and detailed career trajectories have not been firmly documented in accessible sources, the band’s preserved sides remain a useful window into the sound and comedic style of mid‑1920s vaudeville jug ensembles.[2][4]

## Fun Facts
- The Five Harmaniacs were described by later researchers as a “novelty jug band” with a “short‑lived but apparently successful run on vaudeville,” indicating they briefly broke into mainstream touring circuits before disappearing from view.[2]
- Their Victor 20293 release, coupling “Sadie Green, Vamp of New Orleans” with “Coney Island Washboard,” was recorded on December 17, 1926 and is one of the few firmly documented dates for the group.[1][2]
- Music writer Elijah Wald has pointed out that the Jim Kweskin Jug Band’s well‑known rendition of “Coney Island Washboard” explicitly follows the Five Harmaniacs’ 1926 recording, giving the group a posthumous role in the 1960s folk revival.[3]
- References in reissue notes and scholarship on early jug bands list the Five Harmaniacs among only a handful of country jug ensembles to be recorded and later reissued, which is why collectors of old 78 rpm records still seek out their sides today.[2][4][6]
