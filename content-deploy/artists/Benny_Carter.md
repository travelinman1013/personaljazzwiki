## Biography
Benny Carter, born Bennett Lester Carter on August 8, 1907, in New York City, was a prodigious figure in jazz whose career spanned over seven decades. He began his musical education with piano lessons from his mother and was later drawn to the trumpet through family and neighborhood influences. However, Carter found his true voice in the saxophone, becoming a pioneer of the alto sax and a model for swing-era saxophonists. Largely self-taught, he was already performing in Harlem clubs by age fifteen, quickly establishing himself in the vibrant New York jazz scene.[1][4]

Carter's career flourished in the 1920s and 1930s as he worked as an arranger for major bands, including Fletcher Henderson's, helping to shape the swing style. He led McKinney’s Cotton Pickers and his own big bands, and his innovative arrangements showcased the melodic capabilities of the saxophone. Carter spent several years in Europe as a staff arranger for the BBC and as a freelance soloist, before returning to the U.S. to form influential big bands and later settling in Los Angeles. There, he broke new ground for African American musicians in film and television, serving as a staff arranger and composer for major studios and networks.[1][2][3][5]

Throughout his life, Carter was celebrated for his versatility—not only as a saxophonist but also as a trumpeter, clarinetist, pianist, and arranger. His compositions, such as "When Lights Are Low" and "Blues In My Heart," became jazz standards. Carter continued to perform, teach, and advocate for racial equity in music well into his nineties, earning numerous honors including multiple Grammy Awards and the Kennedy Center Honors. He passed away on July 12, 2003, in Los Angeles, leaving an enduring legacy as one of jazz’s most influential and respected figures.[1][2][5]
