## Biography
James 'Boo Boo' Davis was born on November 4, 1943, in Drew, Mississippi, a small town near Clarksdale in the heart of the Delta blues region. He began his musical journey at an exceptionally young age, starting to play drums with his family band when he was seven years old, though he would later develop proficiency as a vocalist and harmonica player as well. His nickname 'Boo Boo' was derived from his father's brothers, James, establishing a family connection to his stage identity.

Throughout his career, Davis has performed as a multi-instrumentalist bluesman, working both as a solo artist and in partnership with other musicians, notably Arthur Williams. He represents one of the last generations of blues musicians who write and perform based on firsthand experience of the blues tradition, having been immersed in music since childhood. His work spans traditional blues and modern blues styles, with recordings that showcase his authentic approach to the genre.

Boo Boo Davis stands as a survivor of the classic blues era, maintaining his connection to the authentic Delta blues tradition while continuing to perform and record. His longevity in the music industry and dedication to preserving the blues through lived experience rather than academic study make him a significant figure in contemporary blues music. His most popular recordings, including 'I'm So Tired,' demonstrate his enduring appeal to blues audiences.
