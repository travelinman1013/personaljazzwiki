## Biography
Gene Austin, born Lemeul Eugene Lucas in Gainesville, Texas in 1900, began his musical journey early, learning piano and guitar in Minden, Louisiana.  His singing career unexpectedly launched at age 15 after a daring impromptu performance at a Houston vaudeville show.  This led to a paid position with the vaudeville company, showcasing his natural talent.  His early musical influences stemmed from his time singing in a Southern Baptist choir, and his experiences playing piano in New Orleans' vice district during his brief stint in the U.S. Army, where he served in both Mexico and France during World War I.  After the war, he briefly pursued dentistry and law in Baltimore before returning to music.

Following his time in Baltimore, Austin's career blossomed. He formed a vaudeville act with Roy Bergere, co-writing "How Come You Do Me Like You Do".  He later collaborated with Aileen Stanley on the popular song "When My Sugar Walks Down the Street" for Victor Talking Machine Company.  His career skyrocketed with the release of "My Blue Heaven," which sold over 5 million copies, holding the title of best-selling record for a time.  Other major hits included "The Lonesome Road," "Riding Around in the Rain," "Tonight You Belong to Me," and "Ramona."  At the height of his success, he insisted on Fats Waller as his sole accompanist.  He also worked with Nathaniel Shilkret and collaborated with George Reneau, providing vocals for his recordings.  Later in his career, he formed a trio, "Gene Austin and his Candy and Coco," with bassist Johnny Candido and guitarist Otto Heimel, and had a radio series from 1932 to 1934.  Colonel Tom Parker, later Elvis Presley's manager, began promoting Austin in 1938.  Austin also appeared in several films, including *Belle of the Nineties*, *Klondike Annie*, and *Sadie McKee* (all 1934), *Songs and Saddles* (1938), and *My Little Chickadee* (1940).

Austin is recognized as an influential early crooner, credited by later artists like Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra, and Russ Columbo for shaping their genre. His intimate, radio-friendly singing style, adopted alongside contemporaries like Rudy Vallee, contrasted with the earlier, fuller-voiced style of tenors.  Despite never learning to read music, he composed over 100 songs, many of which became standards and were recorded by numerous artists, including Duke Ellington, Nat King Cole, Bing Crosby, Louis Armstrong, and Frank Sinatra. His recordings achieved record sales and high circulation, significantly impacting the music industry.  His legacy includes two Grammy Hall of Fame inductions for "My Blue Heaven" and "Bye Bye Blackbird."  His influence extended to country music, with Jimmie Rodgers citing him as an idol.  Austin's success allowed him a comfortable retirement in Palm Springs, California, where he remained active in civic affairs until 1970.
