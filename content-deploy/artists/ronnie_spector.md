## Biography
Ronnie Spector, born Veronica Yvette Bennett on August 10, 1943, in East Harlem, New York City, grew up in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan. She formed the Ronettes in the late 1950s with her sister Estelle Bennett and cousin Nedra Talley, quickly becoming a defining voice of the girl group era. The Ronettes signed with Phil Spector’s Philles label in 1963, producing a string of iconic hits such as 'Be My Baby,' 'Baby, I Love You,' and 'Walking in the Rain.' Ronnie’s distinctive, emotive vocals and the group’s bold style—marked by teased hair, dramatic makeup, and confident stage presence—helped establish the 'bad girl' image in rock and roll and set them apart from contemporaries.[2][1]

Ronnie’s career was deeply intertwined with producer Phil Spector, whom she married in 1968. Their relationship was marked by severe emotional and physical abuse, which she later detailed in her memoir 'Be My Baby.' After escaping the marriage in 1972 and finalizing her divorce in 1974, Ronnie re-formed the Ronettes with new members and eventually established herself as a solo artist. Her solo career included the albums 'Siren' (1980), 'Unfinished Business' (1987), and 'English Heart' (2016), as well as a notable feature on Eddie Money’s 'Take Me Home Tonight' in 1986, which revived her popularity with a new generation.[2][3]

Ronnie Spector’s influence extended far beyond her own recordings. She was a muse and inspiration for artists across genres, from Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys to punk icons like the Ramones and Blondie. Her legacy is cemented in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (inducted with the Ronettes in 2007), and she is widely recognized as a trailblazer whose style and sound shaped the future of pop, rock, and punk music.[2][1]
