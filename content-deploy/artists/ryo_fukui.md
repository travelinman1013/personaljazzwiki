## Biography
Ryo Fukui was born on June 1, 1948, in Hokkaido, Japan. He began his musical journey relatively late, first learning the accordion at age 18 before teaching himself piano at 22. Driven by self-discipline and a passion for jazz, Fukui moved to Tokyo, where he immersed himself in the local jazz scene and honed his craft, despite occasional setbacks and feelings of slow progress. His perseverance paid off with the release of his debut album 'Scenery' in 1976, followed by 'Mellow Dream' in 1977, both of which showcased his dexterous playing and a style influenced by jazz greats such as McCoy Tyner and Bill Evans.[1][2][4]

Fukui's career flourished as he performed regularly in trios, notably with bassist Satoshi Denpo and his brother Yoshinori Fukui on drums. He became a fixture at renowned Japanese jazz venues and later performed internationally, including in France and America. In 1992, Fukui deepened his connection to bebop through mentorship with American pianist Barry Harris, further refining his technique. In 1995, Fukui and his wife Yasuko opened the Slowboat jazz club in Sapporo, which became a vibrant hub for jazz performance and education. His final album, 'A Letter From Slowboat' (2015), was recorded live at the club, serving as a heartfelt culmination of his musical journey.[2][1]

Fukui passed away from lymphoma on March 15, 2016, but his legacy endures. The Slowboat jazz club continues to operate, preserving the culture he fostered. In recent years, Fukui's work has experienced a resurgence, with his albums—especially 'Scenery'—being rediscovered and celebrated worldwide, symbolizing the sophistication and allure of Japanese jazz.[1][2][4]
