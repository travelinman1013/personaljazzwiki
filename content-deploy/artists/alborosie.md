## Biography
Alberto D'Ascola, professionally known as Alborosie, was born on July 4, 1977, in Marsala, Sicily, Italy. Growing up in a vibrant musical environment with a deep appreciation for Jamaican culture, he was inspired by reggae legends such as Bob Marley, Burning Spear, and Peter Tosh. He taught himself to play multiple instruments including guitar, bass, drums, keyboards, and percussion. At just 15 years old in 1993, Alborosie joined the Italian reggae band Reggae National Tickets (billing himself as Stena), which became the first Italian band to perform at major Jamaican festivals like Sunsplash and Sumfest in the 1990s, selling over 200,000 records across Europe.

In 2001, Alborosie made a life-changing decision to leave the band and relocate to Kingston, Jamaica, to immerse himself in the birthplace of reggae music and pursue a solo career. The transition was challenging, and he famously acquired his stage name by combining "Al" from his first name with "Borosie," a Jamaican term that was initially used derisively toward him. He quickly became integrated into Jamaica's music scene, working as an engineer at Gee Jam Studios in Portland under the mentorship of legendary producer Clifton "Specialist" Dillon, where he collaborated with numerous international and local artists. His breakthrough came in 2006 with the single "Herbalist," which David Rodigan named best song of the year, followed by his critically acclaimed debut album "Soul Pirate" in 2008.

Alborosie has established himself as the first Italian reggae artist to achieve international recognition and the first white artist to be distributed by Bob Marley's Tuff Gong label in Jamaica. Known for his distinctive deep, gravelly voice and authentic production style, he has released numerous successful albums including "Escape from Babylon" (2010), "2 Times Revolution" (2011), and "Freedom & Fyah" (2016). His music addresses socio-political issues, justice, faith, and love, earning him respect throughout the reggae industry and solidifying his status as the Italian Reggae Ambassador. Alborosie continues to bridge cultural gaps and contribute significantly to the global reggae movement.
