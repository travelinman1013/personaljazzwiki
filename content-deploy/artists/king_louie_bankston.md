## Biography
Louis Paul Bankston, known professionally as King Louie, was born on December 18, 1972, in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, and grew up in Harahan, a suburb of New Orleans. His musical journey began in the late 1980s when his interest in skateboard culture led him to discover punk and garage rock music. His family's hardware store in Harahan eventually expanded into a skate shop, reflecting the cultural shift that shaped his artistic sensibilities. After experimenting with numerous early punk projects including the Intelligenitals, the Lame Ones, and the Clickems, Bankston formed the Royal Pendletons as a teenager, which became arguably his first proper band. Throughout his career, he remained rooted in the underground garage-rock and punk scenes, cultivating a reputation as a prolific songwriter and musician who rejected the nihilistic approach of grunge in favor of melodic, guitar-driven rock infused with pop sensibility and emotional authenticity.

Bankston's musical style occupied a unique space between raw garage rock and power pop, characterized by his ear for rock-and-roll songcraft that was melodic, romantic, and winkingly dangerous. His most significant mainstream recognition came through his work with Portland-based power pop band the Exploding Hearts in the early 2000s, where he co-wrote most of the songs on their 2003 album 'Guitar Romantic,' including the cult hit 'I'm a Pretender.' Beyond this collaboration, Bankston maintained extraordinary creative prolificacy, participating in over 25 bands and projects throughout his career, including the Loose Diamonds, Black Rose Band, Missing Monuments, and the solo project King Louie One Man Band. His work was characterized by irreverent humor, energetic performances, and an unwavering commitment to authentic rock-and-roll expression despite struggling with substance use and health issues throughout his life. King Louie Bankston passed away on February 13, 2022, leaving behind a legacy as a deeply influential figure in the underground rock scene, beloved by a devoted community in New Orleans and respected by musicians across the country.

Despite his prolific output and critical acclaim within underground music circles, Bankston remained more of a cult classic and 'secret password' to those in the know rather than achieving mainstream celebrity status. His influence extended across the Southeastern underground music scene, and he collaborated with numerous respected artists including members of the Oblivians, Memphis punk pioneer Jay Reatard, and Quintron and Miss Pussycat. His legacy is characterized not by commercial success but by his unwavering artistic integrity, his ability to blend punk energy with pop sensibility, and his role as a connector within the underground rock community who helped define the aesthetic and ethos of independent garage rock from the late 1980s through the 2010s.

## Fun Facts
- Bankston's family hardware store in Harahan expanded into a skate shop when he was a middle schooler, directly influenced by his passion for skateboarding culture, which in turn shaped his musical taste and punk-rock aesthetic.
- He explicitly rejected the grunge movement that dominated his generation, famously stating: 'I've never been a grunge-rocker. It just seemed like a lot of people trying not to have fun. Not having fun is one thing, but actually putting effort into not having fun? It's just no fun.'
- One of his most playful projects was King Louie One Man Band in the mid-2000s, which sounded as if he was alone with his own creative engine and goofy sense of humor, showcasing his ability to blend irreverent comedy with serious musicianship.
- Despite being involved in over 25 bands and projects throughout his career, Bankston was obsessed with maintaining an accurate Wikipedia page listing all of his musical endeavors, demonstrating his awareness of his prolific output and commitment to documenting his legacy.
