## Biography
Luther Dickinson was born in western Tennessee to Mary Dickinson and Jim Dickinson, a renowned Memphis producer and musician who profoundly shaped his musical trajectory.[1][3] Growing up in Memphis during the 1950s and 1960s, Luther was immersed in a rich musical environment, surrounded by his father's collaborations with legends including Aretha Franklin, Bob Dylan, the Rolling Stones, Albert King, and Bukka White. This early exposure to diverse musical traditions—from rock and roll to blues to roots music—instilled in him a deep appreciation for American musical heritage and a commitment to musical excellence that would define his career.[1]

Luther made his recording debut at age 14 and went on to establish himself as a multi-talented musician, producer, and songwriter.[3] In 1996, he co-founded the North Mississippi Allstars with his brother Cody on drums, a band that became legendary for their high-energy performances rooted in Hill Country blues and Mississippi rock and roll.[1][2] Beyond the Allstars, Luther has maintained an extensive solo career and has been a member of The Black Crowes (alongside Rich Robinson), South Memphis String Band, and The Word. His distinctive slide guitar style and innovative approach to roots music—treating traditional songs as structural foundations for improvisation rather than fixed compositions—earned him recognition as a "New Guitar God" by Rolling Stone Magazine in 2007.[7]

As a 10-time Grammy Award-nominated producer and artist, Luther has collaborated with an impressive array of musicians including the Replacements, Beck, Ry Cooder, Lucinda Williams, Levon Helm, Mavis Staples, and many others.[3][4] Following his father Jim Dickinson's passing in August 2009, Luther joined Phil Lesh and his son Grahame for performances at Terrapin Crossroads in San Rafael, California, where he specialized in interpreting the Pigpen material from the Grateful Dead repertoire.[2] His 2023 album *Magic Music For Family Folk* represents a culmination of his artistic vision, featuring songs passed down through four generations of his family and recorded in intimate, communal settings.[4]

## Fun Facts
- Luther developed a distinctive and unconventional slide guitar technique called the 'lowebow,' played on a cigar box guitar, which has become a signature element of his sound that few other musicians have replicated.[5]
- In the mid-1990s, Luther produced Otha Turner's album 'Everybody Hollerin' Goat,' which Rolling Stone Magazine named one of the top ten blues records of the 1990s.[3]
- Luther recorded the bulk of his 2023 album 'Magic Music For Family Folk' during informal family gatherings—dinner parties, sleepovers, and play dates—before stowing the project away for years while he composed film scores and developed his production skills.[4]
- Luther made his recording debut at just 14 years old and has since collaborated with an extraordinarily diverse range of artists spanning multiple genres, from Beck to Lucinda Williams to the Dirty Dozen Brass Band.[3]
