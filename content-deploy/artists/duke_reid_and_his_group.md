## Biography
Arthur 'Duke' Reid, born on July 21, 1915, in Portland, Jamaica, was a pioneering figure in Jamaican music, best known for his work as a record producer, DJ, and label owner. After serving ten years as a police officer, Reid transitioned into the music industry, founding one of the most popular sound systems of the 1950s, Reid's Sound System, where he earned the nickname 'The Trojan.' His early career was marked by a deep love for American jazz, blues, and R&B, which influenced his musical selections and production style. In the 1960s, he established the Treasure Isle record label, which became synonymous with ska and rocksteady music, producing hits for artists such as Stranger Cole, Alton Ellis, and The Techniques. Reid's studio was a hub for innovation, and his hands-on approach set him apart from his contemporaries. Despite his initial skepticism toward ska, he eventually became one of its most influential producers, shaping the genre's golden era. In the 1970s, as reggae evolved and Rastafarian themes gained prominence, Reid's influence waned, but he remained active by recording toasters like U-Roy and Dennis Alcapone. He passed away in 1975 after battling cancer, leaving behind a legacy as a foundational figure in Jamaican music.
