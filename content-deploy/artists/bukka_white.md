## Biography
Booker T. Washington "Bukka" White (November 12, 1906 – February 26, 1977) was a foundational figure in American Delta blues, renowned for his expressive vocals and powerful slide guitar technique. Born in Houston, Mississippi, White was the grandson of a former slave and grew up in a musical household; his father, John White, was a multi-instrumentalist who gave him his first guitar and introduced him to local musical traditions. White developed his signature bottleneck slide style through instruction from local musicians and further honed his skills on guitar and piano during his travels across the Mississippi Delta and St. Louis.[1][2][3][8]

White's career began in earnest in 1930 when talent scout Ralph Lembo arranged his first recording session in Memphis, producing country blues and gospel tracks. He gained wider recognition with the 1937 release of "Shake 'Em On Down" in Chicago, but that same year was incarcerated at Parchman Penitentiary for a shooting incident. Folklorist John Lomax recorded him there in 1939, capturing some of White's most enduring songs. After his release, White recorded twelve influential tracks in Chicago in 1940, including "Fixin' to Die Blues" and "Parchman Farm Blues." He settled in Memphis during World War II, working in defense plants and performing with blues legends like Frank Stokes. White's music career waned in the 1950s, but he was "rediscovered" in the 1960s folk revival, touring extensively in North America and Europe and recording new material for Takoma and Arhoolie Records.[1][2][3][6]

White's musical style is marked by driving, percussive slide guitar, open tunings, and call-and-response vocals, often blending elements of blues, gospel, and country blues. His storytelling lyrics and emotive delivery influenced generations of blues musicians. He was instrumental in helping his younger cousin, B.B. King, establish himself in Memphis and the broader music scene. Posthumously inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1990, White's legacy endures through his recordings, annual festivals in his honor, and continued recognition as a master of classic blues.[1][2][3][8]

## Fun Facts
- White was recorded at Parchman Penitentiary by folklorist John Lomax in 1939, but only allowed Lomax to record two songs because he was reluctant to perform for free.
- His nickname 'Bukka' is a phonetic spelling of 'Booker,' his given name.
- White's percussive slide guitar style often involved using a bottleneck and snapping bass strings to create rhythmic effects.
- He was honored with a marker on the Mississippi Blues Trail in Houston, Mississippi, and an annual Bukka White Blues Festival is held in Aberdeen.
