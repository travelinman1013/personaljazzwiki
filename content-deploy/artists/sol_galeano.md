## Biography
Sol Galeano is a multidisciplinary musician, producer, and visual artist known for crafting deeply personal, atmospheric R&B and experimental pop that blurs the lines between sound, storytelling, and visual design. Based in the United States, they emerged in the late 2010s as a self-directed creative force, handling songwriting, production, and the visual universe surrounding their releases. According to their own studio site, they have developed a broad creative practice that spans music, film scores, brand work, and visual direction for prominent cultural platforms and artists.[1][3]

By their early twenties, Sol had already built a distinctive body of work and a reputation for “boundless” creativity, often being described as multidimensional and involved in every piece of the creative vision.[1][4] Musically, their catalog includes the 2020 project "GLASS BOI," a release that showcases hazy textures, intimate vocals, and fragmented song structures, followed by singles and collaborations such as “THINK OF ME,” “FILLMYLUNGS,” and "IN YOUR AIR" featuring reia and nicotine.[2][6] Their sound often incorporates dreamy synths, downtempo beats, and confessional lyricism, resonating with audiences drawn to experimental R&B and alt-pop. Beyond their own releases, Sol has worked with clients and platforms such as Saint Heron, Afropunk, Red Bull, Noname, and others, extending their impact into broader creative and cultural spaces.[1][3] While their legacy is still developing, Sol Galeano’s early career already reflects a model of the modern independent artist: self-styled, visually driven, and active across multiple disciplines.
