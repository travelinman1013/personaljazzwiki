## Biography
Jonathan David Samuel Jones, known as Jo Jones and later as Papa Jo Jones, was born on October 7, 1911, in Chicago, Illinois, though he grew up in Alabama where he studied music for 12 years.[1][2] Before becoming one of jazz's most revolutionary drummers, Jones was a multi-instrumentalist, mastering trumpet, saxophone, piano, and vibes. He began his professional career in the late 1920s as both a tap dancer and instrumentalist with carnival shows and regional territory bands, including Walter Page's Blue Devils in Oklahoma City.[2][3] His early work with Lloyd Hunter's Serenaders in 1931 and subsequent collaborations with pianist Tommy Douglas eventually led him to Kansas City, where his career would be forever transformed.[1]

Jones joined Count Basie's band in 1934, marking the beginning of his most influential period.[2][4] From 1934 to 1948, with a two-year military service interruption from 1944 to 1946, Jones anchored what became known as the "All-American Rhythm Section" alongside Basie on piano, Freddie Green on guitar, and Walter Page on bass.[2][3][4] This legendary rhythm section revolutionized jazz by providing an unequaled lift and support for soloists while bringing richness of sound and subtlety to jazz rhythm.[6] Jones's drumming style fundamentally transformed the instrument's role in jazz, shifting the basic pulse from the bass drum to the hi-hat cymbal, playing on slightly open hi-hats and closing them on beats 2 and 4 to create a more flowing sound.[1] Rather than pounding the bass drum on all four beats, he played more softly, occasionally "dropping bombs" by accenting bass drum notes, and he became renowned for his masterful brush playing.[1][3]

After leaving the Basie band in 1948, Jones became a highly sought-after freelance drummer, performing with Jazz at the Philharmonic and recording with jazz luminaries including Billie Holiday, Duke Ellington, Lester Young, Art Tatum, and Benny Goodman.[4] His influence on modern jazz drumming cannot be overstated—he is credited with establishing the ride cymbal as the primary timekeeping instrument and inspiring generations of drummers including Max Roach, Roy Haynes, Kenny Clarke, Art Blakey, Philly Joe Jones, and Elvin Jones.[2][5][6] Jones continued performing regularly at the West End jazz club in New York City, where his performances attracted other renowned drummers. He was inducted into the Alabama Jazz Hall of Fame in 1979 and named a Jazz Master by the National Endowment for the Arts in 1985, the year of his death on September 3.[3][4]

## Fun Facts
- Jo Jones was a multi-talented performer who began his career as both a tap dancer and instrumentalist with carnival shows, and he could play trumpet, saxophone, piano, and vibes in addition to drums—he chose drums as his primary instrument partly because 'being a drummer paid better.'[6]
- Jones was known for his irascible and combative temperament, contrasting sharply with his graceful and elegant drumming style.[2]
- In an era when extroverted showmanship and drum solos were admired among drummers, Jones seldom chose to solo, instead focusing on dynamic shadings and providing musical punctuation to support the band.[3]
- Jones had an uncanny instinct for finding great music sessions; he would discover or instinctively know where the greatest jazz sessions would be held in any city or town he visited, ensuring he was present for historic musical moments.[6]
