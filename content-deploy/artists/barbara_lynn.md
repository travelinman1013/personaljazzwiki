## Biography
Barbara Lynn (born Barbara Lynn Ozen, January 16, 1942, in Beaumont, Texas) is an acclaimed American rhythm and blues singer, songwriter, and left-handed electric guitarist, celebrated for her soulful voice and pioneering role as a female instrumentalist in the early 1960s. Raised in a Catholic family, Lynn began her musical journey playing piano and singing in her church choir, but soon gravitated toward the guitar, inspired by blues and rock icons such as Guitar Slim, Jimmy Reed, and Elvis Presley. By high school, she had formed an all-female band, Bobbie Lynn and Her Idols, and was already writing her own songs and winning local talent contests.

Lynn's big break came when she was discovered by swamp pop singer Joe Barry, who introduced her to producer Huey Meaux. This led to her first recording session at Cosimo Matassa’s J&M Studio in New Orleans, resulting in the 1962 hit "You'll Lose a Good Thing," which topped the Billboard R&B chart and reached #8 on the pop chart. Lynn's distinctive contralto voice, smooth guitar work, and songwriting prowess set her apart in a male-dominated industry. She toured extensively with soul legends such as Sam Cooke, Stevie Wonder, Ike and Tina Turner, and Al Green, and her songs were later covered by major artists including Otis Redding, Aretha Franklin, and the Rolling Stones. Despite stepping back from music after her husband's death, Lynn returned to performing in the 1980s and has continued to record and tour internationally, earning the title "Empress of Gulf Coast Soul" and receiving the National Heritage Fellowship in 2018.

Barbara Lynn's legacy is marked by her trailblazing role as a Black female guitarist and songwriter in soul and blues, her influence on both peers and future generations, and her enduring impact on the Gulf Coast sound. Her music remains celebrated for its emotional depth, melodic inventiveness, and the rare combination of vocal and instrumental artistry.
