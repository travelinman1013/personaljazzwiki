Walter 'Wolfman' Washington was born on December 21, 1943, in New Orleans, where he grew up surrounded by music. He began his musical journey by singing in his mother's church choir and later learned to play guitar using a homemade instrument made from a cigar box and rubber bands. His professional career took off in 1962 when he joined Lee Dorsey's band, followed by stints with Irma Thomas and Johnny Adams.
