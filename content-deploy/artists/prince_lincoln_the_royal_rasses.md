## Biography
Prince Lincoln Thompson, known as Sax, was born on July 10, 1949, in Jonestown, Kingston, Jamaica. He emerged in the Jamaican music scene during the late 1960s as a harmony singer with The Tartans, alongside Cedric Myton, before the group split in 1969[1][3]. Thompson's early career flourished at Studio One, where he recorded notable tracks such as 'Daughters of Zion,' 'True Experience,' and 'Live Up to Your Name.' In 1974, he formed The Royal Rasses, a band that became a vehicle for his innovative songwriting and spiritual messages, deeply rooted in the Rastafari movement[1][2].

Thompson's music with The Royal Rasses was distinguished by his high falsetto voice and a unique blend of reggae with international influences, including elements of soul, jazz, and funk. Albums like 'Humanity' (1974), 'Experience' (1979), and 'Natural Wild' (1980, featuring English rock musician Joe Jackson) showcased his willingness to experiment beyond traditional reggae rhythms, earning both acclaim and controversy among purists[1][2][3]. Despite commercial challenges, especially with the cross-genre 'Natural Wild,' Thompson remained committed to creating music for the moral upliftment of humanity, as reflected in his lyrics and themes[2].

Prince Lincoln Thompson's legacy endures through his pioneering work in roots reggae and his influence on subsequent generations of musicians. His humanitarian outlook, innovative musical style, and spiritual conviction have earned him recognition as one of reggae's most distinctive voices, even if his contributions remain underappreciated compared to contemporaries like Bob Marley. Thompson passed away from cancer in London on January 14, 1999, leaving behind a rich catalog of music and a reputation for artistic integrity[1][3].
