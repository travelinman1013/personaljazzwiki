## Biography
Elza Soares was a legendary Brazilian samba singer whose career spanned over six decades, making her one of the most influential voices in Brazilian music. Born in 1930 in Rio de Janeiro, Soares grew up in poverty and faced numerous hardships, including early marriage and the loss of her children. Her musical journey began when she won a radio contest at age 16, which launched her career as a crooner. She quickly gained fame for her powerful, husky voice and innovative style, blending samba with jazz and scat singing, notably in her debut hit 'Se Acaso Você Chegasse.' Over the years, she became a symbol of resilience and artistic reinvention, recording with major figures in Brazilian music and touring internationally. In the 1980s, she was rediscovered by younger generations, including rock bands like Titãs, and continued to push musical boundaries into the 21st century, earning accolades such as being named 'Singer of the Millennium' by the BBC in 2000. Her legacy endures as a pioneering force in samba and a cultural icon of Brazil.
