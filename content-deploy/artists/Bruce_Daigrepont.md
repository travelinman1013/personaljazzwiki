## Biography
Bruce Daigrepont, born July 11, 1958 in New Orleans, Louisiana, is a celebrated Cajun accordionist and singer whose roots trace to Avoyelles Parish, a region deeply embedded in Cajun tradition. His parents, part of a post-World War II migration from rural Louisiana, maintained their Cajun French language and customs, instilling in Bruce a strong sense of cultural pride from an early age[1][6]. Family gatherings were filled with music, with his father playing guitar in the Carter Family style and his uncle singing traditional Cajun songs. By age five, Bruce was playing guitar, and by ten, he had taken up the banjo[1][3][4].

Daigrepont's musical journey took a pivotal turn in 1978 after attending Festival Acadiens in Lafayette, which inspired him to master the Cajun accordion. By 1980, he formed his own Cajun band and began hosting weekly fais do-do dances at the Maple Leaf Bar in New Orleans, helping to popularize Cajun music and dance in the city[1][5]. His recording career began in 1986 with "Stir Up the Roux" on Rounder Records, followed by critically acclaimed albums such as "Coeur des Cajuns," "Petit Cadeau," and "Paradis." Daigrepont is known for his inventive approach, writing many original songs while staying true to the traditional Cajun sound. His performances are renowned for their spontaneity, with a repertoire of over 200 songs spanning Cajun waltzes, two-steps, blues, swamp pop, zydeco, and R&B[1][3].

Bruce Daigrepont is widely recognized as a passionate advocate for the preservation of Cajun culture and language. His music is characterized by a focus on accordion and fiddle, supported by a rhythm section that maintains the hard-edged Cajun style. Daigrepont's influence extends beyond performance; he has contributed significantly to the Cajun revival movement, inspiring both audiences and fellow musicians to embrace and evolve the tradition[1][7][8].
