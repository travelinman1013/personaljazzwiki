## Biography
Nat Myers is a Korean-American blues musician and poet, born in 1990 in Kansas and raised in Northern Kentucky. His early years were marked by a restless spirit and a search for identity, growing up as one of the few Asian faces in rural Kentucky. Initially drawn to skateboarding and hardcore music, Myers was introduced to guitar by his mother, who hoped it would keep him out of trouble. Despite early resistance to formal music education, he developed a distinctive left-handed fingerstyle technique that would become central to his sound[4][5][6].

Myers' journey into music was deeply intertwined with his love for poetry, which he studied at The New School in New York City. Busking on street corners and subway stations, he honed his craft and began sharing his performances online during the COVID-19 pandemic. This exposure led to a pivotal connection with Dan Auerbach of The Black Keys, who produced Myers' debut album, 'Yellow Peril,' released in 2023 on Easy Eye Sound. The album, which reached #1 on the Billboard Blues Charts, is celebrated for its blend of jumpy blues, folk roots, and poetic lyricism, reflecting Myers’ experiences as a first-generation Korean-American and his fascination with American history and storytelling[1][3][4].

Myers’ music is characterized by a stripped-down, pre-war blues style reminiscent of Charley Patton and Mississippi John Hurt, yet infused with his own modern perspective and personal narrative. His work has resonated widely, leading to tours across the US, Europe, and Australia, and establishing him as a fresh voice in contemporary blues[2][5][7].
