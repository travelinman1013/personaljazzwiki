## Biography
Bobby Henderson Powell is an American rhythm and blues and gospel singer, pianist, and songwriter whose powerful, gospel-rooted voice made him a cult favorite among Southern soul aficionados in the 1960s and 1970s.[2][6] Born near Winnfield, Louisiana, in 1943 according to most biographical sources, he was blind from birth and attended the Louisiana State School for the Negro Blind at Southern University in Baton Rouge, where he developed his skills as a singer and pianist.[1][2] He first sang in local gospel groups and began performing professionally in the 1950s, drawing on the church tradition that would shape his vocal style for decades to come.[1][4][6]

In the mid‑1960s Powell shifted from gospel to secular R&B, signing with Shreveport entrepreneur Lionel Whitfield’s Whit label and releasing his debut single “What Are You Trying to Do to Me” in 1965.[1][2] His second single, a driving, churchy version of the blues standard “C.C. Rider,” became his biggest hit, reaching number one on the national Cash Box R&B chart, number 12 on the Billboard R&B chart, and entering the pop chart in early 1966.[1][2] He followed it with “Do Something For Yourself,” which also charted R&B, and continued to cut a string of Southern soul singles for Whit into the early 1970s, including “I’m Gonna Leave You,” “I’m Gonna Leave You,” backed with the funk‑edged “Done Got Over,” and a 1971 remake of “The Bells,” his final chart entry.[1][2] Critics likened his deep, gritty, testifying style to Clarence Carter, with some writers calling “I’m Gonna Leave You,” with its stinging guitar and shouting chorus, one of the funkiest down‑home soul records of its era.[2]

Powell recorded his first full album, *Thank You*, for Excello Records in 1973, co‑arranging the set and writing several cuts that blended Southern soul, funk, and reflective balladry.[1][2] By the late 1970s he returned more openly to his gospel roots, cutting albums such as *Down By The Riverside* (1978) for Senator Jones’s New Orleans‑based Hep’ Me label and later gospel projects including *Bobby Powell Explains The Glory Of Love* (1981).[1][3][2] Though national chart success was limited, he became a fixture on the Baton Rouge blues and soul circuit in the 1980s, opening for touring acts and maintaining a loyal regional following, and he has continued to make occasional gospel performances in Baton Rouge into the 21st century, securing his reputation as a respected, if under‑recognized, Southern soul and gospel stylist.[1][2][3]

## Fun Facts
- Powell was born blind, as were both of his parents, and he attended a specialized school for blind students at Southern University in Baton Rouge, where he honed both his piano playing and vocal skills.[1][2]
- His biggest hit, a cover of the blues standard “C.C. Rider,” was originally recorded by Gertrude “Ma” Rainey in 1924; Powell’s 1965 version unexpectedly topped the Cash Box R&B chart and crossed over to the pop charts in early 1966.[1][2]
- Critic Colin Larkin singled out Powell’s single “I’m Gonna Leave You,” with its searing blues guitar and shouting gospel chorus, as “one of the funkiest, most down‑home soul records in history.”[2]
- After years of secular R&B and soul recording, Powell consciously returned to his gospel roots in the late 1970s, releasing albums like *Down By The Riverside* and later becoming a regular live presence on the Baton Rouge scene, often opening for major touring acts while remaining largely unknown outside the region.[1][3]
