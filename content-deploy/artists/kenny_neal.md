## Biography
Kenny Neal was born on October 14, 1957, in New Orleans, Louisiana, into a deeply rooted multi-generational blues family from Baton Rouge. As the oldest of ten children, he began playing music at a very young age, learning the fundamentals from his father, Raful Neal, a renowned blues harmonica player and singer who moved in the same circles as Buddy Guy and Slim Harpo. A formative moment came when Slim Harpo gave the crying three-year-old a harmonica to pacify him—Neal never put it down, eventually mastering harmonica, guitar, bass, trumpet, and piano. At just 13 years old, he joined his father's band, and four years later, at 17, he was recruited to tour extensively as Buddy Guy's bass player, an apprenticeship that solidified his blues credentials and exposed him to the highest levels of the genre.

Neal's professional recording career began in 1987 with his debut album *Bio on the Bayou*, released on King Snake Records and later reissued by Alligator Records as *Big News from Baton Rouge!!* in 1988, which established him as a modern swamp-blues master with the touch and voice of an old soul combined with the vision of a young artist. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, he released numerous acclaimed albums across multiple labels including Telarc and Alligator, while also demonstrating his versatility by appearing in the 1991 Broadway production of *Mule Bone* (by Langston Hughes and Zora Neale Hurston), where he performed numbers written by Taj Mahal. His career has been marked by consistent recognition, including a 2016 Grammy nomination for his album *Bloodline* in the Best Contemporary Blues Album category, a 2019 Blues Music Award for Contemporary Blues Male Artist of the Year, and his 2011 induction into the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame.

As a second-generation southern Louisiana bluesman, Neal has dedicated himself to preserving and advancing the Baton Rouge blues tradition while remaining imaginative enough to steer it in contemporary directions. His 2022 album *Straight From The Heart*, recorded at his own Brookstown Recording Studios in Baton Rouge with local musicians, represents a homecoming project that channels the spirit of the music that shaped his early years. Throughout his career, Neal has maintained a staunch Canadian fan base from his time fronting the Downchild Blues Band in Toronto during the 1980s, and he continues to tour internationally, bringing his inimitable guitar work, powerful harmonica playing, and roadworn voice to audiences around the globe.
