## Biography
Jack DeJohnette's Special Edition was a pioneering jazz ensemble formed by the acclaimed Chicago-born drummer, pianist, and composer Jack DeJohnette in 1979. DeJohnette, already established as one of the most versatile and influential drummers in jazz, assembled Special Edition to explore the boundaries of free jazz, post-bop, and avant-garde styles. The group's debut album, 'Special Edition,' recorded in New York in March 1979 and released by ECM in 1980, featured a quartet with DeJohnette on drums, piano, and melodica, David Murray on tenor saxophone and bass clarinet, Arthur Blythe on alto saxophone, and Peter Warren on bass and cello[1][3][5]. The album won the Down Beat Readers’ Poll Album of the Year award and was lauded for its innovative compositions and dynamic interplay, including tributes to jazz legends Eric Dolphy and Zoot Sims, as well as interpretations of John Coltrane pieces[1][5].

Over the years, Special Edition underwent several personnel changes, with subsequent albums such as 'Tin Can Alley' (1981), 'Inflation Blues' (1983), and 'Album Album' (1984) showcasing new collaborators like Howard Johnson (tuba, baritone saxophone), John Purcell (alto and soprano saxophone), and Rufus Reid (bass)[4]. Despite these changes, the group maintained a consistent vision of creative improvisation and genre-blending, often spotlighting rising talents in the jazz world. DeJohnette's leadership and compositional skills allowed Special Edition to serve as both a platform for his own musical ideas and a launchpad for the careers of his bandmates[2][3].

Special Edition's legacy lies in its adventurous spirit and its role in shaping modern jazz, particularly in highlighting the talents of musicians who would go on to become major figures in the genre. The ensemble's recordings are celebrated for their energy, humor, and technical mastery, and they remain influential in the evolution of contemporary jazz, inspiring both listeners and future generations of musicians[2][3][5].
