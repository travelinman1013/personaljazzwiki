## Biography
Melanie Safka, known professionally simply as **Melanie**, was born on February 3, 1947, in Astoria, Queens, New York, and grew up in a musical household where her mother was a professional jazz singer.[4][3] She made her first public appearance at age four on a New York radio show and later studied acting at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, where she began performing in Greenwich Village folk clubs such as The Bitter End.[2][1] Discovered by Columbia Records A&R legend John Hammond, she signed to Columbia in the late 1960s, releasing early singles including “Beautiful People,” which, though initially unsuccessful in the U.S., became a hit in the Netherlands.[6][2]

After moving to Buddah Records, Melanie broke through in Europe with the 1969 French number-one single “Bobo’s Party” and became part of the late‑1960s folk movement.[1][2] Her appearance at the 1969 Woodstock Festival—where she performed in the rain and witnessed the audience lighting candles—directly inspired her 1970 U.S. Top 10 hit “Lay Down (Candles in the Rain),” from the album *Candles in the Rain*.[1][4][6] Establishing herself with albums such as *Born to Be* (1968), *Affectionately Melanie* (1969), and *Candles in the Rain* (1970), she became known for an emotive, childlike yet powerful vocal style that blended folk, pop, and rock, often addressing themes of love, peace, freedom, and social justice.[4][1] In 1971 she and her husband/producer Peter Schekeryk founded Neighborhood Records—often cited as the first female‑owned independent rock label—and scored her biggest U.S. success with the quirky chart‑topping single “Brand New Key,” followed by further hits like “Ring the Living Bell” and “The Nickel Song.”[3][1][6]

At her commercial peak, Melanie was named Billboard’s No. 1 Top Female Vocalist of 1972 and became an official UNICEF ambassador that same year, choosing charity work over a world tour.[1][2][5] Although her last U.S. Top 40 hit, “Bitter Bad,” arrived in 1973, she continued to record prolifically—ultimately releasing more than two dozen albums—and her songs were covered by artists ranging from Nina Simone and Ray Charles to Miley Cyrus and Morrissey, underscoring her enduring influence.[3][4] In 1989 she won a Primetime Emmy Award for writing the lyrics to “The First Time I Loved Forever,” the theme for the TV series *Beauty and the Beast*, further cementing her reputation as a distinctive and lasting voice in American singer‑songwriting.[2][5]
