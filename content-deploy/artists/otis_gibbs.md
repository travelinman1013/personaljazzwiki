## Biography
Paul Otis Gibbs III is an American alt-country singer-songwriter and podcaster who has independently released several albums since 2002.[3] Raised in Wanamaker, Indiana, a neighborhood on the outskirts of Indianapolis, Gibbs was introduced to music at an early age when he would sing in a nearby saloon while a friend of his aunt's played piano.[3] Before fully committing to music, Gibbs worked for over 10 years as a tree planter in Indiana, planting an estimated 7,000+ trees while developing his craft as a songwriter.[3][4] His early reputation was built through performances in small neighborhood bars and clubs in the Midwest and South, but his career gained significant momentum when he began playing gigs in the UK and Europe.[1]

Gibbs' musical style draws from classic American folk music, country, roots, and rock, combined with Methodist hymns from his childhood.[1] His songs feature narratives about everyday working people with relatable, self-deprecating tales and thought-provoking lyrics that tackle complicated social issues without condescension.[1] His 2014 album *Souvenirs of a Misspent Youth* was described by *The Tennessean* as "his most pleasing, direct and artful work," establishing him as a significant voice in independent country and roots music.[3] In 2024, his tenth studio album *The Trust of Crows* was recorded at the legendary Columbia Studio A in Nashville, where Bob Dylan recorded *Blonde on Blonde* and *Nashville Skyline*.[4]

Beyond his music career, Gibbs has become a cultural archivist and storyteller. He hosts the podcast *Thanks for Giving a Damn*, which has been featured on iTunes' "New And Noteworthy" and "What's Hot" lists, and he hosts *Country Built* on Pandora for over 3 million subscribers.[3][5] His YouTube channel, with more than 100,000 subscribers, preserves personal stories and folklore from legendary musicians, reflecting his reverence for history and lived experience in the spirit of the Lomax Family and Studs Terkel.[4] Gibbs has embraced a DIY ethic throughout his career, starting his own record label and creating his own artistic ecosystem while maintaining the independent spirit that defines his work.[4]

## Fun Facts
- Gibbs has planted an estimated 7,176 trees during his 10+ years as a tree planter in Indiana, a fact he humorously includes in his artist biography alongside the claim that he 'once wrestled a bear and lost.'[4]
- His 2014 album *Souvenirs of a Misspent Youth* was recorded at Columbia Studio A in Nashville, the same studio where Bob Dylan recorded *Blonde on Blonde* and *Nashville Skyline*, a space that had been closed to the public for decades before Gibbs was granted permission to record there.[4]
- Gibbs has recorded over 100 podcast episodes for *Thanks for Giving a Damn* and hosts *Country Built* on Pandora for over 3 million subscribers, creating a living archive of American roots music stories in the spirit of the Lomax Family and Studs Terkel.[4][5]
- Despite being called 'the best unknown songwriter in music today,' Gibbs describes himself simply as 'a folksinger' and has maintained the same work shirt and old felt hat he wore while planting trees 25 years ago.[4]
