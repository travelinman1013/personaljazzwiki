## Biography
Diesel Doug & The Long Haul Truckers is a cult country band from Portland, Maine, led by singer-songwriter Scott Link, known professionally as Diesel Doug. The group emerged in the Maine roots-music scene, gaining a reputation as the house band at Gritty’s Old Port brewpub, where they performed trucker country-style music characterized by humorous, road-themed songs that evoke classic honky-tonk and working-class narratives.[2][3][7] Their sound aligns with expectations of trucker country, featuring witty lyrics and traditional instrumentation, as heard in tracks like 'My Girlfriend is a Waitress' from their 2005 release and 'Jesse Rose.'[2][6]

The band released albums including 'An Angel, Not a Saint,' 'Mistakes Were Made (1995-2005),' and material from the mid-2000s, blending original songs with a playful nod to trucking culture.[3][7] Scott Link drew inspiration from earlier Maine musicians, adapting a song like 'It’s all over now and it’s all over town' (originally from Doug Hubley's repertoire) for their first CD.[1] Active primarily in the 1990s and 2000s, they built a local following through live performances and recordings that captured the gritty, fun essence of Maine's Americana scene.[2][5]

Though not widely known beyond regional circles, the Truckers left a legacy as a staple of Portland's roots music community, with enduring appeal among fans of niche country subgenres. Their low Spotify popularity (1) reflects their cult status rather than mainstream success.[context]
