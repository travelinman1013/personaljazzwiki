## Biography
Timothea Beckerman, known simply as Timothea, was born in Westwego, Louisiana, and began her musical journey at a young age, singing for change in her aunt's bar before sharing the stage with New Orleans legends like Earl King, Irma Thomas, Ernie K-Doe, Dr. John, Johnny Adams, and the Neville Brothers by age twelve[1][4][6][7]. At fourteen, she recorded her first single, 'Teenage Prayer,' produced by Wardell Quezergue with Dr. John on guitar, marking her early entry into the vibrant New Orleans R&B and blues scene[1]. After a brief hiatus from music to raise her family, Timothea returned in 1981, releasing singles produced by Earl King and collaborating with members of the Neville Brothers and the Meters[1]. Her career flourished through the 1980s and 1990s, co-writing albums with Walter 'Wolfman' Washington, forming The RoadMasters band, and later moving to New York, where she performed in coffeehouses and jazz clubs and produced her first CD[1][5]. Timothea's musical style was rooted in blues, soul, and R&B, drawing comparisons to Etta James and Tina Turner for her powerful vocals and high-energy performances, yet maintaining a distinct voice and songwriting style that resonated deeply with audiences[4]. She was also a passionate advocate for Hepatitis C awareness, founding Siren to Wail Inc. and organizing benefit concerts featuring New Orleans icons such as Dr. John, Buddy Guy, and Allen Toussaint[1]. Timothea's legacy endures as a pioneering female artist in the New Orleans music scene, celebrated for her talent, activism, and influence on generations of musicians[4].
