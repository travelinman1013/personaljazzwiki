## Biography
Neko Case, born September 8, 1970, in Alexandria, Virginia, is an American singer-songwriter renowned for her powerful vocals and genre-defying songwriting. Raised in a turbulent household, Case moved frequently during her childhood, ultimately considering Tacoma, Washington her hometown. She left home at age 15 and soon immersed herself in the Pacific Northwest's vibrant punk scene, performing as a drummer for several bands by her late teens. In 1994, she relocated to Vancouver, British Columbia, to attend art school, where she became a fixture in the local punk and indie music community, playing with groups such as Maow and cub.

Case's solo career began in earnest with her 1997 debut album 'The Virginian,' which showcased her unique blend of country, folk, and indie rock influences. She soon formed her own backing band, the Boyfriends, and became a founding member of the acclaimed Canadian indie rock collective The New Pornographers. Over the years, Case has released a series of critically lauded solo albums, including 'Furnace Room Lullaby' and 'Fox Confessor Brings the Flood,' earning praise for her haunting, evocative lyrics and commanding vocal presence. Her music resists easy categorization, drawing from alt-country, Americana, indie rock, and art pop traditions.

Case's legacy is marked by her fierce artistic independence and her influence on the alt-country and indie music scenes. She is celebrated for her idiosyncratic, imagistic songwriting and her role in revitalizing interest in the tenor guitar. Case remains a vital force in contemporary music, both as a solo artist and as a key member of collaborative projects, and is frequently cited as an honorary Canadian due to her deep ties to the country's music community.
