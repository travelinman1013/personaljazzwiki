## Biography
Rhiannon Giddens (born February 21, 1977) is an American singer, multi‑instrumentalist, songwriter, and composer from Greensboro, North Carolina, whose work bridges folk, old‑time, country, blues, and classical traditions.[1][6] Raised in a racially mixed family in Greensboro, she grew up singing along to R&B groups like the Manhattans and reading activist writers such as Audre Lorde before pursuing classical voice at the Oberlin Conservatory, where she trained as an opera singer.[1][5][6] After college she returned to North Carolina, became active in the contra‑dance community, and immersed herself in Celtic and Scottish song, simultaneously discovering the African roots of the banjo and old‑time string‑band music, an historical thread that would become central to her artistic mission.[1][6]

In the mid‑2000s Giddens co‑founded Sankofa Strings and then the Carolina Chocolate Drops, a Black string band dedicated to reviving and re‑centering African American contributions to old‑time and country music; as the group’s lead singer, fiddler, and banjoist, she helped win a Grammy Award for Best Traditional Folk Album for their 2010 release "Genuine Negro Jig".[1][6][7] While working with the Drops she also appeared in Celtic projects and began a solo career that accelerated after producer T Bone Burnett featured her in the all‑star project "Lost on the River: The New Basement Tapes" in 2014, leading to her Nonesuch debut "Tomorrow Is My Turn" (2015), followed by "Freedom Highway" (2017), collaborations with Italian multi‑instrumentalist Francesco Turrisi including "There Is No Other" (2019) and the Grammy‑winning "They’re Calling Me Home" (2021), and the more mainstream‑leaning "You’re the One" (2023).[1][2] Alongside her recordings she has acted (notably in the TV series "Nashville"), written for ballet and film, and co‑composed the opera "Omar" with Michael Abels, which won the 2023 Pulitzer Prize for Music.[1][3]

Giddens’s musical style is rooted in banjo and fiddle‑driven string‑band traditions yet inflected by her operatic training, resulting in an agile soprano and interpretive approach that moves fluidly between spirituals, protest songs, country standards, and original compositions.[1][6] A two‑time Grammy winner and MacArthur "Genius" grant recipient, she has become a leading public historian of American music, using concerts, essays, and educational projects to highlight how Black and Indigenous musicians shaped genres often perceived as "white," and to challenge the racial labels attached to folk, country, and bluegrass.[1][3][6] Since 2020 she has served as artistic director of Yo‑Yo Ma’s Silkroad ensemble and was named musical director of the 2023 Ojai Music Festival, further cementing her legacy as both a virtuosic performer and a cultural leader committed to re‑telling the story of American music from the ground up.[1][2][3]
