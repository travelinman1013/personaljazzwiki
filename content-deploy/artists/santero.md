## Biography
Santero, also known as Erick Santero, was born in Guatemala into a family tradition of Latin musicians and Sonidero sound system DJs. Raised amid the mountains, jungles, and Atlantic coasts of Central America, he traveled extensively from Guatemala to Panama, performing with his father's salsa and cumbia bands. Fleeing political upheaval in the late 1970s and 1980s as a refugee, he arrived in the United States, where he honed his craft in the ghettos of New York, New Orleans, the barrios of San Francisco, and Los Angeles, blending traditional Latin roots with influences from reggae, jazz, punk, funk, and hip-hop to create an international fusion sound.[1][3][4]

A pivotal moment came during an extended stay in Havana, Cuba, where Santero was initiated as a priest in the Yoruba/Santería religion, crowned as an avatar of the deity Obatala, the spirit of peace and light. This spiritual awakening redirected his music toward exposing the essence of the Pan-African Diaspora through club-friendly rhythms and rhymes. His style evolved into urban Latin fusion, incorporating reggaeton, cumbia, salsa, bachata, and sacred ocha music, often infused with spiritual and social themes.[1][3][4]

Based in Oakland, California (with past ties to New Orleans and San Francisco), Santero works as a recording artist, producer, DJ, and radio host, running the successful weekly Latin music showcase VOODOO and his label Santero Music. His debut album earned him Best New Artist from Batanga magazine in 2005, followed by Remezcla's Top Ten in 2008 and an NPR feature in 2009. Albums like 'El Hijo de Obatala' (2009) and 'Canciones de Amor y Protesta' showcase his blend of urban beats, traditional percussion, and horns, addressing personal, spiritual, and social issues.[1][3][5]
