## Biography
Brandon Woody is a Baltimore-born trumpeter, composer, and bandleader who began his musical journey at age 7, eventually becoming a New York Times-featured artist and rising force in contemporary jazz.[1][3] His musical education was comprehensive and rigorous, beginning with his initial struggles on the trumpet at Leith Walk Elementary School in Baltimore, where he persevered through two weeks of difficulty before mastering the instrument. His talent was nurtured through the Peabody Institute's Tuned-In Program and the Eubie Blake National Jazz Institute and Cultural Center under the mentorship of multi-instrumentalist Craig Alston.[2] At Baltimore School of the Arts, Woody found his artistic center, where he met vibraphonist Warren Wolf and reconnected with Alston, eventually forming the band Just Us Jazz with pianist Troy Long when younger musicians were excluded from the existing jazz combo.

Woody's higher education took him to the Brubeck Institute in Stockton, California, where he studied under composer and trumpeter Ambrose Akinmusire and roomed with saxophonist Isaiah Collier, before continuing his studies at the Manhattan School of Music under vibraphonist Stefon Harris and trumpeter Cecil Bridgewater.[2] During his time in New York, he performed with Gio Escobar's Standing on the Corner and toured with Solange, gaining exposure to diverse musical contexts. Upon returning to Baltimore, Woody and Troy Long reformed their working group with bassist Mike Saunders and drummer Quincy Phillips, establishing a monthly residency at An die Musik that transformed their sound and audience.[2] He became a mainstay on the D.C. jazz scene, performing at venues like Marvin and Sotto, and founded his band Upendo in 2017 while still in college.[4]

Woody's career has expanded significantly beyond performance into composition, film scoring, and brand collaborations. He has scored films including *Unwavering: The Power of Black Innovation*, *Keep What You Sow*, and *Paint it Black Baltimore*, and worked as a casting director and band leader for Apple TV's *Lady in the Lake* (2024).[4] His collaborations with international brands include Calvin Klein, Nike, Reebok, and Vogue Italy, while his original compositions and performances have earned him recognition as a Bach/Conn endorsed artist (since 2021) and Best Musician to Watch by Baltimore Magazine (2022).[4] In November 2024, Woody signed with the legendary Blue Note Records, releasing his debut album *For The Love Of It All* in May 2025, cementing his position as a significant voice in contemporary jazz.[1] His music draws from the rich lineage of Black music including jazz, gospel, and improvisation, exploring themes of love, resilience, and community.[1]

## Fun Facts
- Woody initially struggled for two weeks to produce any sound on the trumpet when he first started at age 8, but persevered and earned the right to take the school's trumpet home to practice every day by the end of the year.[2]
- When younger musicians were excluded from the dominant upperclassmen-led jazz combo at Baltimore School of the Arts, Woody and Troy Long improvised a solution by creating their own band called Just Us Jazz, which even earned gigs in the area.[2]
- In his early composition attempts, Woody admitted he was 'just writing chords like poetry' without understanding harmony and rhythm, simply writing what 'looked nice to my eyes'—a humbling reminder of his artistic growth.[2]
- Woody appeared as the real-life character Roy 'Tanglefoot' McCoy in Apple TV's *Lady in the Lake* (2024), combining his talents as both a musician and actor.[2][4]
