## Biography
Ramón 'Mongo' Santamaría Rodríguez was born on April 7, 1917, in Havana, Cuba, into a family that cherished music and African heritage. Initially learning violin, he switched to percussion instruments like maracas, bongos, congas, and timbales, teaching himself after dropping out of middle school. He began performing in 1937 at Havana's Tropicana Club with bands such as Conjunto Matamoros and Septeto Beloña, rising to prominence in the local scene during the 1940s.[1][2][3][5]

Santamaría moved to New York in 1950, where he formed the city's first charanga band, Black Cuban Diamond, with trumpeter Gilberto Valdés. He collaborated with Pérez Prado, engaged in legendary percussion duels with Tito Puente during the mambo era, and joined Cal Tjader's band in 1958, contributing to West Coast Latin jazz. In 1962, he formed his own band, achieving commercial success with his 1963 cover of Herbie Hancock's 'Watermelon Man,' which hit the top ten on U.S. pop charts, and composing the jazz standard 'Afro Blue.' His style fused Afro-Cuban rhythms with jazz, R&B, soul, and funk, pioneering Latin-soul and boogaloo.[1][2][3][4][5][6]

Santamaría recorded prolifically for labels like Fantasy and Columbia, worked with Fania All-Stars, and performed globally until his death on February 1, 2003, in Miami from a stroke at age 85. His legacy as a virtuoso conga player and innovator endures, influencing generations in Latin jazz and percussion techniques.[1][2][3][5]
