## Biography
Robert "Wolfman" Belfour (September 11, 1940 – February 24, 2015) was an acclaimed American blues guitarist and singer, celebrated for his powerful, hypnotic style rooted in the North Mississippi Hill Country blues tradition. Born in Red Banks, Mississippi, Belfour learned guitar from his father, Grant Belfour, and further developed his craft under the guidance of local blues legends. After his father's death when Robert was thirteen, he balanced music with helping his family, eventually moving to Memphis, Tennessee in 1959, where he worked in construction for 35 years while playing music on the side.

Belfour's professional music career began late in life, gaining local recognition in Memphis through performances on Beale Street in the 1980s. His breakthrough came in the 1990s when musicologist David Evans recorded him for the compilation "The Spirit Lives On: Deep South Country Blues and Spirituals in the 1990s." This exposure led to a recording contract with Fat Possum Records, resulting in his debut album "What's Wrong With You" (2000) and the follow-up "Pushin' My Luck" (2003), both of which received critical acclaim. Belfour's music is characterized by a deeply percussive guitar attack, use of alternate tunings, and a droning, syncopated rhythm that distinguishes Hill Country blues from Delta blues.

Despite starting his recording career late, Belfour became a respected figure in the blues world, performing at festivals in the US and Europe and serving as a vital link to the rural blues traditions of Mississippi. His legacy endures as one of the last authentic voices of the Hill Country blues, influencing a new generation of roots musicians and earning recognition as a cultural treasure.
