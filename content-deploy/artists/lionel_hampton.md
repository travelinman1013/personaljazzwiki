## Biography
Lionel Hampton was born on April 20, 1908, in Louisville, Kentucky, and became one of the most influential jazz musicians of the 20th century.[1] He began his musical career as a drummer in the Chicago Defender Newsboys' Band before moving to California in the late 1920s, where he played with various ensembles including Paul Howard's Quality Serenaders, with whom he made his recording debut in 1929.[1] The pivotal moment in Hampton's career came in 1930 when Louis Armstrong invited him to play vibraphone during a recording session, resulting in the first jazz recordings to feature improvised vibraphone solos on "Memories of You" and "Shine."[1] This chance encounter transformed Hampton into the "King of the Vibes," establishing the vibraphone as a legitimate jazz instrument and becoming his primary instrument for the rest of his career.

Hampton's rise to prominence accelerated when Benny Goodman recruited him in 1936 to augment his trio with Teddy Wilson and Gene Krupa.[3] During his four years with the Goodman organization, Hampton recorded some of his most celebrated work, taking memorable solos on tracks like "Dizzy Spells," "Avalon," and "Moonglow," while occasionally replacing Gene Krupa on drums.[1][3] In 1940, Hampton left Goodman on amicable terms to form his own big band, which became one of the most popular and exciting ensembles in jazz history.[3] His 1942 composition "Flying Home," driven by Illinois Jacquet's unforgettable tenor saxophone solo, became his signature hit and perennial theme song.[3] Hampton's orchestra was renowned for its tremendous energy, dazzling showmanship, and ability to attract world-class musicians, establishing itself as a breeding ground for jazz talent.

Throughout his career, Hampton composed over 200 musical works, including jazz standards such as "Evil Gal Blues" and "Midnight Sun," as well as the symphonic work "King David Suite."[4] Beyond his musical achievements, Hampton served as a goodwill ambassador for the United States under President Eisenhower, leading his band on extensive international tours to Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and the Far East.[4] He was also credited as the first big band leader to incorporate organ and electric bass into his ensemble.[5] Despite health challenges, Hampton continued performing into his 90s, maintaining sellout crowds worldwide throughout the 1980s and 1990s.[1] He passed away on August 31, 2002, in New York, leaving behind an extraordinary legacy that fundamentally shaped the development of jazz music and influenced generations of musicians.[1]

## Fun Facts
- Hampton's introduction to the vibraphone was entirely serendipitous—during a 1930 recording session with Louis Armstrong, a vibraphone had been fortuitously left in the studio, and when Armstrong asked Hampton to play it, he created the first-ever jazz recordings to feature improvised vibraphone solos, fundamentally establishing the instrument in jazz.[1]
- Hampton was credited as the first big band leader to incorporate organ and electric bass into his ensemble, demonstrating his innovative approach to orchestration and willingness to experiment with new instrumental combinations.[5]
- Despite his legendary status in jazz, Hampton's riff-based music achieved crossover success on rock radio stations in the early 1950s, and he even appeared in a movie with rock 'n' roll disc jockey Alan Freed, bridging the gap between jazz and emerging rock and roll genres.[5]
- Hampton served as a goodwill ambassador for the United States under President Eisenhower and later received the National Medal of the Arts from President Clinton, demonstrating his significance beyond music as a cultural ambassador.[4]
