# DIXON'S JAZZ MANIACS

## Biography
Dixon's Jazz Maniacs was a Chicago jazz trio led by Vance Dixon, an alto saxophonist, clarinetist, and vocalist born on September 12, 1901, in Parkersburg, West Virginia. The ensemble, which included band members Kline Tyndall and Lawrence Dixon, recorded several titles for Paramount Records beginning in 1926. The group emerged during the peak of the hot jazz explosion of the mid-to-late 1920s, a period marked by innovative electric recording techniques that allowed musicians to capture more dynamic performances. Dixon's Jazz Maniacs represented the creative ferment of Chicago jazz during this era, blending traditional jazz elements with novelty approaches that characterized Dixon's musical identity.

The trio's recordings, made between 1926 and 1927 in Chicago, showcased the energetic and experimental spirit of the period. Their version of "Tiger Rag" is noted as distinct and interesting, while "Crazy Quilt," recorded in January 1927, exemplifies their approach to hot creative jazz. The group's work has been preserved and reissued by Frog Records, a British label specializing in rare jazz and blues recordings. Though Dixon's Jazz Maniacs recorded only a limited number of sides before the group's dissolution, their recordings remain significant examples of Chicago jazz from the 1926-1927 peak of the jazz explosion, capturing a moment when musical innovation was occurring simultaneously across multiple stylistic directions.
