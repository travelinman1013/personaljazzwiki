## Biography
Deacon John is the stage name of John Moore, a New Orleans singer, guitarist, and bandleader who emerged from a large, musically inclined Creole family and became a fixture of the city’s rhythm and blues scene from the late 1950s onward. Raised in New Orleans, Louisiana, he sang in his church choir as a child and bought his first guitar from a pawn shop, studying records and learning directly from local guitar masters while still in his teens. Over time he developed into a versatile performer who could handle R&B, rock ’n’ roll, blues, and pop standards, making him one of the most in‑demand bandleaders for club dates, dances, and social events across the region.

In the early part of his career, Moore led Deacon John & the Ivories, a group that became a popular working band in New Orleans clubs and dancehalls and eventually secured a coveted role as a house band at the Dew Drop Inn, a legendary Black nightclub and touring stop. There he and his band backed a long list of visiting stars and also attracted the attention of key local producers and arrangers, which led to extensive work as a studio guitarist on many New Orleans R&B recordings in the 1960s. His tasteful rhythm work and ability to adapt to different artists’ styles made him a first‑call session musician, even when he was not credited by name on record labels.

As the decades progressed, Deacon John remained a constant presence in New Orleans music, performing at the inaugural New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival around 1970 and appearing there regularly in subsequent years. He continued to lead bands that specialized in classic New Orleans dance music, playing weddings, Mardi Gras balls, and festivals while also fronting concert productions that celebrated the city’s R&B heritage. Later career projects included a well‑received album and concert film that showcased his role in the New Orleans tradition, helping solidify his legacy as both a working musician and a cultural ambassador for the city’s classic rhythm and blues sound.
