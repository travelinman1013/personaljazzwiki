## Biography
Jack White, born John Anthony Gillis on July 9, 1975, in Detroit, Michigan, is an American musician, producer, and songwriter who has become one of the most influential rock artists of the 21st century. Before achieving international fame, White worked as an upholsterer by day while performing in underground Detroit bands, initially as a drummer. His breakthrough came in 1997 when he co-founded The White Stripes with fellow Detroit native Meg White. Despite divorcing in 2000, the couple continued performing together, presenting themselves as siblings to avoid public scrutiny. The White Stripes released seven critically acclaimed albums, including their self-titled debut (1999), the breakthrough album White Blood Cells (2001), the million-selling Grammy Award-winning Elephant (2003), and Icky Thump (2007), before officially disbanding in 2011.

Beyond The White Stripes, White demonstrated remarkable musical versatility through multiple concurrent projects and collaborations. He founded The Raconteurs in 2005 with Brendan Benson and established The Dead Weather in 2009 with Alison Mosshart of The Kills, returning to his original instrument on drums. White also pursued a solo career beginning in 2012 with his debut album Blunderbuss, followed by the critically acclaimed Lazaretto (2014), which broke the record for the largest sales week for a vinyl album since SoundScan began tracking in 1991. In 2008, he collaborated with Alicia Keys on "Another Way to Die," the theme song for the James Bond film Quantum of Solace, making them the only duet to perform a Bond theme.

White's influence extends beyond performance into production and entrepreneurship. He established Third Man Records in Nashville after relocating from Detroit, and has produced albums for other artists, most notably Loretta Lynn's Van Lear Rose (2004), which won Grammy Awards for Best Country Album and Best Country Collaboration. To date, White has won 12 Grammy Awards across eight different categories with 34 career nominations, and was honored with the Producers & Engineers Wing "President's Merit Award" in 2017. His artistic legacy encompasses blues rock and garage rock genres, characterized by minimalist aesthetics, technical innovation, and a devotion to analog recording formats, particularly vinyl.
