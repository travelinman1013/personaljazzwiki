## Biography
Garry Burnside is a prominent American blues musician, recognized for his mastery of the Hill Country blues style and his role in perpetuating the legacy of his legendary father, R.L. Burnside. Born in Coldwater, Mississippi and raised in Holly Springs, Garry grew up surrounded by music, learning guitar, bass, and drums from a young age. His early exposure to blues came not only from his family but also from the vibrant local scene, where he absorbed influences from artists like Albert Collins, Little Milton Campbell, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Jimi Hendrix, and B.B. King[1][2][7].

Burnside began performing publicly as a teenager, initially playing bass for Junior Kimbrough, a foundational figure in North Mississippi hill-country blues. After Kimbrough’s death in 1998, Garry launched his own band and shifted to lead guitar, developing a distinctive style he calls 'Funk Hill Country,' which blends traditional blues with elements of rock and funk[2][4][5]. He has collaborated with a range of artists, including the North Mississippi Allstars, Hill Country Revue, Bobby Rush, Beverly Davis, and his own family members such as Cedric Burnside and Duwayne Burnside[2][3][5]. His solo debut album, 'It’s My Time Now,' produced by Grammy winner Boo Mitchell, marks his emergence as a frontman and showcases his deep Southern grooves and soulful vocals[3][5].

Garry Burnside’s career is defined by his commitment to both preserving and innovating the blues tradition. He regularly performs at clubs and festivals throughout the South, teaches private lessons, and continues to record new music from his base in Ripley, Mississippi. His work honors the heritage of Hill Country blues while pushing its boundaries, ensuring its relevance for new generations[5][6].
