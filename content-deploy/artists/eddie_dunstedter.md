## Biography
Eddie Dunstedter was born on August 2, 1897, in Edwardsville, Illinois, USA. He was educated at Washington University before launching his music career in the 1920s, initially playing organ for silent film stars and accompanying screenings across the United States.[1][2][4] In 1926, he discovered the vocal group The Merry Macs, marking an early highlight in his career as a talent spotter and musical director.[3]

During the 1930s and 1940s, Dunstedter established himself as a prominent organist and composer, performing widely and serving as musical director for several radio shows in the late 1940s.[1][3][4] Known for his work in organ music, including aliases like Eddie Dunstedter with The Jingle-Bells Orchestra, he contributed to film soundtracks such as Christmas with the Kranks (2004, using his music posthumously) and Donovan's Brain.[2][5] His style centered on organ performances, often evoking holiday themes given his Spotify association with Christmas genres.

Dunstedter passed away on July 30, 1974, in Reseda, California, leaving a legacy as a versatile radio and film composer whose organ work bridged silent films, radio eras, and holiday music traditions.[1][2][5]
