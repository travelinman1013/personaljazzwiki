## Biography
Wade Marcus is an acclaimed American jazz, soul, and funk arranger, producer, and band leader, born in Cleveland, Ohio. He began his career at Motown, where his talent for arrangement quickly made him a sought-after figure, contributing to recordings for legendary acts such as Smokey Robinson & The Miracles, Diana Ross & The Supremes, Marvin Gaye, Gladys Knight & The Pips, and Stevie Wonder—most notably arranging Wonder's hit "For Once In My Life"[1][2][5].

After his tenure at Motown, Marcus released his debut solo album, "A New Era," in 1971 on the Cotillion label, followed by further work with Blue Note Records. His musical style is distinguished by sophisticated, soulful horn arrangements and a fusion of jazz, funk, and soul elements. Marcus became known for his ability to blend genres and for his innovative use of instrumentation, such as adding harp to organist Reuben Wilson's Blue Note sessions, which gave the recordings a unique sound[1].

Throughout his career, Marcus collaborated with a wide array of artists, including Bobbi Humphrey, Grant Green, and Johnny Hammond, and his arrangements have been praised for their groove and originality. His legacy is evident in the lasting influence he has had on jazz-funk and soul music, both through his own recordings and his work as an arranger for other prominent musicians[1][2][5].
