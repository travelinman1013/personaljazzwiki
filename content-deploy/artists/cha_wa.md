## Biography
Cha Wa is a Grammy-nominated Mardi Gras Indian funk band based in New Orleans, Louisiana, renowned for blending the vibrant traditions of Mardi Gras Indian street culture with contemporary funk and brass band sounds. The group was founded in 2014 by drummer and bandleader Joe Gelini, who, after being inspired by New Orleans funk legends like The Meters and the Neville Brothers in high school, moved to New Orleans following his studies at Berklee College of Music. Gelini immersed himself in the local music scene, learning directly from Mardi Gras Indian musicians and drummers, notably taking lessons from Idris Muhammad and participating in neighborhood practices with Monk Boudreaux, Big Chief of the Golden Eagles tribe.

Cha Wa's music is deeply rooted in the call-and-response traditions and rhythms of the Mardi Gras Indians, with a modern twist that incorporates brass band energy and funk grooves. Their debut album, 'Funk n Feathers' (2016), explored contemporary riffs on traditional Mardi Gras Indian songs, while their follow-ups, 'Spyboy' (2018) and 'My People' (2021), both received Grammy nominations for Best Regional Roots Music Album. The band's lineup has featured several notable musicians, including frontmen J'Wan Boudreaux (Spyboy of the Golden Eagles) and Joseph Boudreaux Jr. (Second Chief), both direct descendants of Monk Boudreaux, further cementing the group's authentic ties to New Orleans' musical heritage.

Cha Wa's legacy lies in their ability to honor and revitalize the Mardi Gras Indian tradition for new audiences, infusing it with contemporary relevance and energy. Their performances, marked by colorful costumes and infectious rhythms, have brought the sounds and stories of New Orleans street culture to global stages, ensuring the survival and evolution of one of America's oldest folk music traditions.
