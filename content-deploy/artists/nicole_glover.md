## Biography
Nicole Glover is a highly regarded American jazz saxophonist, composer, bandleader, and educator, currently based in New York City. Born and raised in Portland, Oregon, she was introduced to improvised music by her father and began her musical journey on clarinet at age ten, switching to tenor saxophone a year later. Her passion for jazz flourished in high school, where she participated in the American Music Program and was selected for the prestigious Next Generation Jazz Orchestra, performing nationally with luminaries such as Bobby Watson, Julian Lage, and Wynton Marsalis at the Monterey Jazz Festival.

Glover attended William Paterson University, studying under jazz greats Mulgrew Miller, Harold Mabern, and Rich Perry. Returning to Portland in 2011, she quickly became a fixture on the local scene, recording on Esperanza Spalding’s Grammy-winning 'Radio Music Society' and collaborating with George Colligan, Alan Jones, and others. She released her acclaimed debut album 'First Record' in 2015, earning praise for her distinctive sound and emotional depth. Since relocating to New York City, Glover has performed at major venues and festivals worldwide, joined the all-female supergroup Artemis, and toured with Latin Grammy winner Buika. Her 2021 album 'Strange Lands' further established her as a leading voice in contemporary jazz.

Glover’s style is rooted in the hard bop tradition but is marked by a modern sensibility, technical virtuosity, and a deep commitment to improvisational exploration. As an educator, she is on faculty at the New York Jazz Workshop and the Manhattan School of Music, mentoring the next generation of jazz artists. Her career reflects both a reverence for jazz history and a drive to push the music forward.
