## Biography
The Three Sounds was a jazz trio that formed in 1956 in Benton Harbor, Michigan, initially as the Four Sounds. The group's core lineup consisted of pianist Gene Harris (born September 1, 1933), bassist Andrew Simpkins (born April 29, 1932), and drummer Bill Dowdy (born August 15, 1932). Harris and Dowdy had known each other since childhood, performing together in their hometown and even playing in a trio together before both joined the Army in 1951. After their discharge in 1954, they pursued separate musical careers until reuniting in South Bend, Indiana in 1956, where they formed the Four Sounds with Simpkins and a tenor saxophonist. After unsuccessfully cycling through several horn players, the three musicians decided to continue as a trio, becoming The Three Sounds.

For two years, the group played regularly at Midwest venues, particularly in Ohio, working both as a trio and as a rhythm section for touring soloists like Lester Young and Sonny Stitt. They relocated to Washington, D.C., where they continued performing with notable musicians including Miles Davis and Kenny Burrell. In the fall of 1958, they moved to New York to work with Stitt, and shortly after, signed with Blue Note Records following a recommendation from Horace Silver to label head Alfred Lion. Between 1958 and 1962, the trio released nine albums for Blue Note, establishing themselves firmly on the jazz scene despite receiving mixed critical reviews initially. Their musical approach was characterized by light, bluesy, and discreetly swinging performances, with Harris taking center stage with benign and good-hearted improvisations on popular material, while Dowdy's gentle drumming style emphasized persuasion over bravado.

The Three Sounds achieved remarkable commercial success in an era when piano-bass-drums trios were common and difficult to distinguish. After their initial Blue Note period, they recorded for Verve (1962), Mercury (1962-1964), and Limelight (1964-1966) before returning to Blue Note in 1966. The group underwent personnel changes in the late 1960s, with Donald Bailey replacing Dowdy in 1966, followed by Carl Burnette in 1968, and Henry Franklin replacing Simpkins before their final studio album, Soul Symphony, in 1969. The trio disbanded in 1973, and Harris went on to a successful solo career, eventually signing with Concord Jazz in 1985. CD reissues of classic Three Sounds albums in the 1990s prompted a positive critical re-evaluation of their music, cementing their legacy in jazz history. Their influence extended beyond jazz, with their 1971 track "Put On Train" being prominently sampled by the Beastie Boys in "What Comes Around" on their 1989 album Paul's Boutique.

## Fun Facts
- Gene Harris and Bill Dowdy were childhood friends from Benton Harbor, Michigan, who performed together from a young age, with Harris giving public piano performances at just six years old before becoming distracted by boxing and sports.
- The group was originally called the Four Sounds and included a tenor saxophonist, but after unsuccessfully cycling through several horn players, they decided to drop the saxophone entirely and continue as a trio, becoming The Three Sounds.
- Despite receiving a harshly negative review of their first album in Down Beat magazine, the review was so exaggerated that it created a wave of sympathy among listeners, inadvertently helping establish their following before their second album received a four-star rating from the same publication.
- After The Three Sounds disbanded in 1973, Gene Harris retired to Boise, Idaho, where he worked as a musical director at a hotel before Ray Brown convinced him to return to recording, leading to a successful solo career revival in the 1980s and 1990s with Concord Jazz.
