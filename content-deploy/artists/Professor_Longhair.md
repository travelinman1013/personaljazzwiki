## Biography
Henry Roeland Byrd, known professionally as Professor Longhair, was born on December 19, 1918, in Bogalusa, Louisiana. His early life was marked by hardship, with his family relocating to New Orleans after his father's departure. Byrd developed his musical talents in New Orleans, initially as a tap dancer and later as a pianist, influenced by local musicians such as Isidore 'Tuts' Washington and Kid Stormy Weather. He began his career in the late 1940s, adopting the stage name 'Professor Longhair' due to his long hair and unique piano style, which blended blues, jazz, and Caribbean rhythms. His music, including hits like 'Tipitina' and 'Go to the Mardi Gras,' became integral to the New Orleans sound. Despite a tumultuous career with periods of hiatus, Professor Longhair gained significant recognition and was celebrated for his energetic performances, which often involved kicking the piano for added rhythm. A revival in the 1970s brought him back into the spotlight, culminating in a celebrated performance at the Jazz and Heritage Festival. He passed away on January 30, 1980, but his influence on New Orleans music continues to be felt. His legacy includes inductions into both the Blues Hall of Fame and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Professor Longhair's style, characterized by a powerful left hand and distinctive vocal delivery, has inspired many musicians, including Fats Domino, Allen Toussaint, and Dr. John. His music remains a cornerstone of New Orleans rhythm and blues, reflecting the city's vibrant cultural heritage.
