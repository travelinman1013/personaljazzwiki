## Biography
Jenny Davis is a Seattle-born jazz vocalist, composer, and bandleader known for her pure voice, sophisticated arrangements, and commitment to social advocacy. She began singing at age three in her Sunday School choir, and by nine, she was performing with a traveling children’s choir in the Pacific Northwest. After a family move to Bethel, Alaska, and the loss of her father at thirteen, Davis continued her musical education, eventually returning to singing in high school and studying under Maestro David Kyle. She earned her Bachelor of Music from Cornish College of the Arts, graduating with honors and receiving the Maggie Hawthorn Scholarship, which led to her first major gig at Dimitriou’s Jazz Alley.

Davis’s career has spanned over two decades, during which she has performed with top Seattle jazz musicians and led her own ensembles. Her artistry is marked by a blend of jazz standards and original compositions, with a style influenced by bebop, swing, and contemporary jazz. Davis’s commitment to authentic expression and improvisation is evident in her recordings, such as her acclaimed albums 'Daydream,' 'It Amazes Me,' and 'Rearranged.' The latter, released under Three Penny Records, showcases her compositional skills and features collaborations with renowned musicians like Jovino Santos Neto and Dmitri Matheny. In 2018, she earned an MFA in Music Composition from Vermont College of Fine Arts, further deepening her focus on composition and advocacy through music.

Beyond performing, Davis is a dedicated educator, teaching jazz vocals and composition to students of all levels. Her legacy includes not only her musical achievements but also her role as a human rights advocate, using her art to promote acceptance and diversity. She continues to inspire audiences and students alike with her passion for jazz and her commitment to social change.
