## Biography
Christian McBride, born May 31, 1972 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, is a celebrated American jazz bassist, composer, arranger, and bandleader. Raised in a musically rich environment, McBride began on bass guitar before switching to double bass, showing prodigious talent from a young age. He attended the Philadelphia High School for Creative and Performing Arts and later studied at the Juilliard School in New York City, where his career quickly accelerated when he joined Bobby Watson's group, Horizon, at just 17 years old.

Over the past three decades, McBride has become one of the most influential and prolific figures in jazz, appearing on more than 400 recordings and winning nine Grammy Awards. His versatility is reflected in his collaborations with jazz legends such as Freddie Hubbard, Herbie Hancock, and Wynton Marsalis, as well as with artists from R&B, pop, and classical genres, including Sting, Paul McCartney, and Kathleen Battle. As a bandleader, McBride has led acclaimed ensembles such as Inside Straight, the Christian McBride Big Band, and New Jawn, consistently championing both established and emerging talent. In addition to his performance career, McBride is a dedicated educator and cultural curator, serving as Artistic Director of the Newport Jazz Festival and hosting NPR’s 'Jazz Night in America.'

McBride’s musical style is marked by technical virtuosity, deep groove, and an ability to seamlessly blend straight-ahead jazz with funk, soul, Latin, and hip-hop influences. His legacy is defined not only by his own artistry but by his commitment to mentoring the next generation of jazz musicians and expanding the reach of jazz through education and media.
