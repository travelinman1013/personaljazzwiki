## Biography
Frank Stokes (January 1, 1888 – September 12, 1955) was an American blues musician, songster, and blackface minstrel who is considered by many musicologists to be the father of the Memphis blues guitar style.[3][6] Born in Whitehaven, Tennessee, south of Memphis, Stokes began performing on the streets around the turn of the twentieth century, eventually traveling to Memphis every weekend to sing and play.[1][2] By the 1920s, he had developed a vast and eclectic repertoire that ranged from parlor songs, rags, and minstrel tunes to country blues standards and popular songs of the era, performing at fish fries, bars, picnics, and house parties throughout the region.[1]

Stokes' recording career began in earnest in August 1927 when he and guitarist Dan Sane formed the Beale Street Sheiks and recorded their first album for Paramount Records.[1][3] The duo's fluid guitar interplay, combined with propulsive rhythms, witty lyrics, and Stokes' powerful stentorian voice, made their recordings distinctive and influential.[1][3] Between 1927 and 1929, Stokes recorded approximately 38 sides for Paramount and Victor Records, making him one of the most recorded Memphis artists of the era.[1] Notable recordings from this period include "I Got Mine" and "Tain't Nobody's Business if I Do," which became part of the blues canon and were later recorded by other musicians.[1] His final recordings in 1929 featured fiddle player Will Batts and are considered among the most original pieces in his catalogue.[1]

Although his recording career ended as public interest in traditional blues waned during the Great Depression, Stokes remained a popular live performer throughout the 1930s and 1940s, appearing in medicine shows, the Ringling Brothers Circus, and traveling tent shows.[1][3] In the 1940s, he relocated to Clarksdale, Mississippi, where he occasionally performed with blues great Bukka White in local juke joints.[3] By 1952, illness and old age forced him to retire from performing.[3] Stokes died of a stroke on September 12, 1955, in Memphis, the city whose musical legacy he had helped define.[1]

## Fun Facts
- According to guitarist and harmonica player 'Memphis' Willie Borum, Stokes was a physically imposing figure—bald, six feet tall, and weighing 240 pounds—who was also a skilled blacksmith when not performing.[2]
- Stokes' creative peak occurred during the late 1920s, precisely when the record-buying public's interest in traditional blues music was beginning to decline, limiting the commercial impact of his most innovative work.[1]
- His 1928 recording session for Victor Records at the Memphis Auditorium marked a significant stylistic shift, as unlike his previous eclectic mix of older songs, this session focused entirely on blues material.[1]
- Stokes performed with the Ringling Brothers Circus during the 1930s and 1940s, bringing his blues music to audiences far beyond the Memphis region.[1][3]
