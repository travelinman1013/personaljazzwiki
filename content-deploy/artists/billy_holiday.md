## Biography
Billie Holiday, born Eleanora Fagan on April 7, 1915, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, emerged from a turbulent childhood in Baltimore to become one of the most influential jazz and swing vocalists of the 20th century[1][4][5]. Raised primarily by her mother, Holiday faced significant hardships, including poverty and time in a reform school, but found solace in music, singing along to records by Bessie Smith and Louis Armstrong[4][5]. By her early teens, she had moved to New York City, where she began performing in Harlem nightclubs and adopted her stage name, inspired by actress Billie Dove and her father’s surname[3][4].

Holiday's career took off in the 1930s after being discovered by producer John Hammond, leading to her first recordings with Benny Goodman and a fruitful collaboration with pianist Teddy Wilson[1][3]. She became renowned for her unique vocal phrasing, improvisational skill, and emotional delivery, which set new standards for jazz singing[1][4]. Her partnership with saxophonist Lester Young, who nicknamed her "Lady Day," was especially significant, and she broke barriers as the first African American woman to perform with an all-white orchestra led by Artie Shaw[2]. Holiday's repertoire included classics like "God Bless the Child" and the haunting protest song "Strange Fruit," which addressed racial violence in America and is now considered a landmark in civil rights music[2][4].

Despite her artistic achievements, Holiday struggled with addiction and legal troubles throughout her life, which affected her later performances and health. She continued to perform to sold-out audiences, including multiple appearances at Carnegie Hall, and her autobiography, "Lady Sings the Blues," further cemented her status as a cultural icon[1][4]. Holiday died of heart failure on July 17, 1959, at age 44, but her legacy endures through her recordings, posthumous Grammy Awards, and influence on generations of musicians[1][5].

## Fun Facts
- Holiday never learned to read music but developed her unique style by instinct and listening to other musicians[4].
- Her song "Strange Fruit" was originally a poem about lynching and became one of the earliest protest songs of the Civil Rights Movement[2].
- She was openly bisexual, a rarity for her era, and her autobiography "Lady Sings the Blues" became a best-seller and later a major film[2].
- Holiday was posthumously awarded four Grammy Awards for Best Historical Album and inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame as an early influence[1].
