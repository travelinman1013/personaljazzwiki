## Biography
Sarah Ellen Jarosz was born on May 23, 1991, in Austin, Texas, and raised in Wimberley, Texas, in a household that valued diverse musical traditions from jazz and classical to folk and rock. She began her musical journey at age two with piano, then picked up the mandolin at age ten, eventually mastering guitar, clawhammer banjo, and octave mandolin. Her early musical development was profoundly shaped by attending weekly Friday night bluegrass jams in Wimberley and summer music festivals across the country, including RockyGrass near Boulder, Colorado, which she began attending at age eleven. During her senior year of high school, at just sixteen years old, she signed a recording contract with Sugar Hill Records, becoming one of the youngest artists to achieve such recognition in the acoustic music world.

Jarosz's professional career launched with her debut album *Song Up in Her Head* in 2009, produced by Gary Paczosa, which immediately garnered critical acclaim and earned a Grammy nomination for the instrumental track "Mansinneedof." She continued releasing albums including *Follow Me Down* (2011), *Live at the Troubadour* (2012), *Build Me Up from Bones* (2014), and *Undercurrent* (2016), the latter winning two Grammy Awards for Best Folk Album and Best American Roots Performance for "House of Mercy." In 2020, she released *World on the Ground*, which won the Grammy Award for Best Americana Album. Throughout her career, she has been recognized as a contemporary-bluegrass prodigy and described by the *New York Times* as "widely regarded as one of acoustic music's most promising young talents."

Beyond her solo work, Jarosz became a founding member of the progressive-folk trio I'm With Her alongside Sara Watkins and Aoife O'Donovan, releasing their debut album *See You Around* in 2018. Her music skillfully blends Americana and bluegrass traditions with modern influences and sophisticated production, creating a distinctive storytelling experience. She has toured with Garrison Keillor's *Prairie Home Companion* and served as a regular performer on *Live from Here* with Chris Thile. Her artistry has earned her multiple Grammy and Americana Music Association nominations, establishing her as a leading figure in contemporary acoustic and roots music.

## Fun Facts
- Jarosz plays a rare six-string clawhammer banjo with an additional low string, custom-built by luthier Bernard Mollberg from Blanco, Texas, who has only built a few banjos in his career.
- She attended the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston from 2009-2013, a classical music institution that seemed like an unusual fit for a bluegrass musician, but she was able to incorporate her banjo into the music ensembles.
- At the 2010 Wintergrass Music Festival, her performances with fiddle player Alex Hargreaves and cellist Nathaniel Smith were described as "the talk of the festival," helping establish her reputation in the acoustic music world.
- She began singing at age two and had already signed a professional recording contract by age sixteen, making her one of the youngest artists to achieve such recognition in the acoustic music industry.
