## Biography
Lowell Fulson was born on March 31, 1921, in Tulsa, Oklahoma, to parents of Choctaw and African American descent. He grew up around Ada, Oklahoma, where he was immersed in music from an early age, influenced by his grandfather’s violin playing and his uncles’ guitar skills. Fulson began performing in church and local clubs as a teenager, and by 1940, he joined veteran blues singer Alger 'Texas' Alexander for a brief tour. After serving in the military from 1943 to 1945, Fulson moved to Oakland, California, where he launched his recording career. His early hits, such as 'Cryin’ Blues' and 'Three O’Clock Blues,' established him as a leading figure in West Coast blues. Fulson’s innovative addition of a horn section to the standard electric blues combo helped define the 'uptown blues' sound, and his songs like 'Reconsider Baby' became blues standards, covered by artists like Elvis Presley and Eric Clapton. Over a career spanning more than five decades, Fulson recorded for labels including Swing Time, Chess, Kent, and Rounder, and remained a vital force in blues music, earning accolades such as induction into the Blues Hall of Fame and the Rhythm and Blues Hall of Fame. He died on March 6, 1999, near Seal Beach, California.
