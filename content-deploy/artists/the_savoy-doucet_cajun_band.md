## Biography
The Savoy-Doucet Cajun Band is a traditional Cajun music trio formed in 1977, dedicated to preserving and presenting the authentic sounds of southwest Louisiana. The band consists of accordionist and luthier Marc Savoy, guitarist and music historian Ann Savoy, and fiddler Michael Doucet of the renowned group Beausoleil. Together, they have performed and recorded extensively since the late 1970s, releasing five albums on the Arhoolie label and appearing at major festivals and venues worldwide, including the Newport Folk Festival, the Berlin Jazz Festival, and the Smithsonian Institution. Their music is characterized as honed-down, hard-core Cajun, rooted in the old dancehall and house-party traditions, often incorporating early French ballads and historic Cajun instrumentation such as the double fiddle–triangle sound.

Musically, the Savoy-Doucet Cajun Band emphasizes authenticity and deep cultural knowledge, drawing from the rich oral tradition of Cajun music. Marc Savoy, a National Heritage Fellow, is both a master accordion builder and player, while Ann Savoy is a respected scholar and performer whose work includes a definitive book on Cajun music history. Michael Doucet, a Grammy Award winner, brings his deep research into early Cajun and French music, as well as influences from Western swing and Creole styles. The trio’s legacy lies in their role as cultural ambassadors, helping to renew interest in traditional Cajun music among younger generations and through educational outreach, including school programs and state department tours.
