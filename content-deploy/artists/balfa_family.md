## Biography
The Balfa Brothers (Les Frères Balfa), a pioneering Cajun music ensemble from Louisiana, consisted of brothers Dewey (fiddle), Will (fiddle), Rodney (guitar, harmonica, vocals), Burkeman (triangle, spoons), and Harry (Cajun accordion), later joined by accordionist Hadley Fontenot. Born to sharecropper Charles Balfa and Amay Ardoin near Mamou, Louisiana, the brothers learned traditional Cajun music from their father during family gatherings in the 1940s. They formed early groups like the Musical Brothers, playing up to eight dances weekly at local halls, and made their recording debut in 1951 with the 78rpm single 'La Valse de Bon Baurche' b/w 'Le Two Step de Ville Platte,' recorded at home.[1][2][8]

A pivotal performance at the 1964 Newport Folk Festival, where Dewey Balfa played with Nathan Abshire's band and received a standing ovation, sparked a Cajun music revival. Energized, Dewey formalized the Balfa Brothers in 1967 with Rodney, Will, Hadley Fontenot, and his daughter Nelda, touring folk festivals, Europe, and the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City. They released albums on labels like Swallow, blending traditional Cajun with occasional modern elements, and appeared in the 1972 documentary *Spend It All*, significantly boosting Cajun music's visibility during a decline influenced by rock 'n' roll.[1][2][3]

Tragedy struck in 1979 with the car accident deaths of Rodney and Will, followed by Dewey's wife dying of trichinosis in 1980. Despite losses, the group continued with changes, and Dewey, a cultural ambassador, taught workshops and earned a 1982 National Heritage Fellowship until his 1992 death from cancer. The family's legacy endures through Balfa Toujours, founded by daughter Christine Balfa.[1][2][4]
