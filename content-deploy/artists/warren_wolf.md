## Biography
Warren Wolf, born in 1979 in Baltimore, Maryland, began playing music at age three under the guidance of his father, Warren Wolf Sr., a teacher and amateur musician, studying vibraphone, marimba, drums, and piano. Initially focused on classical music, he attended the Peabody Preparatory School for eight years, studying with former Baltimore Symphony Orchestra member Leo LePage, and later with John Locke at the Baltimore School for the Arts during high school, where he developed an interest in jazz. After graduating high school in 1997, Wolf enrolled at Berklee College of Music, studying vibraphone privately with Dave Samuels for seven semesters and befriending future collaborators like Jeremy Pelt and Jason Palmer, while gigging in Boston and serving as house drummer at Wally's Cafe.[1][2][5]

Graduating from Berklee in 2001, Wolf taught percussion there until 2005 before returning to Baltimore to pursue full-time performance. His sophisticated post-bop style on vibraphone, marked by exploratory and acrobatic phrasing, has made him a sought-after sideman with artists like Christian McBride's Inside Straight (joined 2007), SFJAZZ Collective (10-year member), Bobby Watson, Tia Fuller, Joey DeFrancesco, Wynton Marsalis, and others. As a leader, he debuted with Incredible Jazz Vibes (2005, M&I Jazz), followed by Mack Avenue releases like self-titled Warren Wolf (2011), Wolfgang (2016, featuring Benny Green and McBride), and others, blending jazz with influences from classical, ragtime, hip-hop, funk, and more.[1][3][4]

Today, Wolf resides in Baltimore as an international touring musician and educator, serving as faculty at Peabody Conservatory (Johns Hopkins) and San Francisco Conservatory of Music. His multi-instrumental versatility on vibraphone, drums, and piano, combined with rigorous training and broad stylistic palette—from Bach to Herbie Hancock—has established him as a dynamic force in contemporary jazz, with seven leader albums and ongoing contributions to ensembles like Aaron Diehl Quartet.[4][5][6]
