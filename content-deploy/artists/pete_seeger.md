## Biography
Pete Seeger (born May 3, 1919, New York City; died January 27, 2014, New York City) was an American folk singer, songwriter, banjo innovator and lifelong social activist who became one of the central figures in 20th‑century folk music and protest song. Born into a highly musical family—his father, Charles Seeger, was a pioneering musicologist and his mother, Constance, a classical violinist—he grew up surrounded by classical and folk music and learned ukulele, guitar, and five‑string banjo as a teenager.[5][3] After two years at Harvard, he left in 1938 to hitchhike and ride freight trains around the United States, collecting ballads, work songs and spirituals while honing his banjo style.[3][6] In New York he assisted folk archivist Alan Lomax at the Library of Congress, work that deeply rooted him in traditional American music and brought him into contact with Woody Guthrie, Lead Belly, Aunt Molly Jackson and other key folk figures.[6][5]

In 1940 Seeger co‑founded the Almanac Singers, a left‑wing, pro‑union folk group that performed at union halls and political gatherings, blending topical lyrics with traditional tunes.[3][2] In 1949 he helped form The Weavers with Lee Hays, Ronnie Gilbert and Fred Hellerman, scoring major early‑1950s hits with songs such as “Goodnight, Irene” and “On Top of Old Smoky” before being blacklisted during the McCarthy era over their political views.[1][2] Though barred from much commercial media, Seeger toured incessantly, played schools, camps and colleges, recorded prolifically for Folkways Records, and emerged as a guiding elder of the 1960s folk revival in Greenwich Village.[2] As a songwriter, co‑writer or adapter he helped turn pieces such as “If I Had a Hammer,” “Where Have All the Flowers Gone?,” “Turn! Turn! Turn!,” and “We Shall Overcome” into modern folk standards and movement anthems, often emphasizing audience participation and communal singing.[3][2][6]

Throughout his life, Seeger fused music with activism in labor, civil rights, peace and environmental movements. He helped popularize and reshape the civil‑rights anthem “We Shall Overcome,” learning an early version from Zilphia Horton and eventually singing it for Martin Luther King Jr. at the Highlander Folk School, while later marching and performing during key civil‑rights campaigns such as Selma–Montgomery.[3][6] In the 1960s and 1970s he wrote and performed pointed antiwar songs like “Waist Deep in the Big Muddy” and used his visibility to support the emerging environmental movement, notably through his work on the sloop Clearwater to clean up the Hudson River.[6][5] Musically, he helped make the five‑string banjo a signature American folk instrument and modeled a participatory, hootenanny-style performance practice that influenced generations of singer‑songwriters.[2][3] Celebrated as both a tradition‑bearer and a catalyst, Seeger became a mentor and inspiration to artists such as Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, Bruce Springsteen and many others, and is widely credited with doing more than almost any other individual to popularize American folk music in the modern era.[5][3]

## Fun Facts
- Seeger was largely responsible for popularizing the five‑string banjo as a national symbol of American folk music, both through his playing style and his influential banjo instruction book and performances.[2][5]
- He played a key role in transforming the hymn line “We will overcome” into the more singable “We shall overcome,” helping shape the wording of what became the civil‑rights movement’s most famous anthem.[2][3][6]
- During the McCarthy‑era blacklist, when television and major venues were closed to him, Seeger sustained his career by performing at schools, summer camps and on college campuses, sometimes recording as many as five albums a year for Folkways Records.[2]
- Beyond music, Seeger was a major environmental activist: he co‑founded the Hudson River Sloop Clearwater project, using concerts and educational sails to campaign for cleaning up the polluted Hudson River.[5][6]
