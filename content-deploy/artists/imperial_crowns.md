## Biography
Imperial Crowns is a Los Angeles-based blues rock band formed in 1992 by Jimmie Wood and J.J. Holiday, whose musical partnership traces back to the mid-1980s. Wood, a vocalist and harmonica player, was active in the LA scene as the frontman of Jimmie Wood and the Immortals and as a booker at the iconic Madame Wongs club, while Holiday played guitar in the underground band Black Patti. Their shared passion for electric and country blues, soul, rock and roll, swamp pop, psychedelic, rockabilly, and gospel music laid the foundation for the Imperial Crowns’ eclectic sound.[1][2][3]

The band began recording in 1993, with drummer/engineer Billy Sullivan joining as a key member. Officially adopting the name Imperial Crowns in 1994, they became fixtures on the LA club circuit and simultaneously joined The Sacred Hearts, the House of Blues house band, where they performed with legends such as Bruce Springsteen, Buddy Guy, Greg Allman, Taj Mahal, and Chaka Khan. Their debut album, 'Imperial Crowns,' was followed by a series of critically acclaimed releases, including 'Hymn Book' and 'Star of the West.' The band gained a dedicated following in Europe, performing at major festivals like BosPop, Moulin Blues, and the Byron Bay Blues Festival in Australia. After a hiatus from 2008 to 2015, they returned with new albums and continued to tour internationally.[1][3][4]

Imperial Crowns are celebrated for their innovative blend of traditional blues with contemporary influences, described as 'ferocious blues, psyche-delta soul & pumpin’ funk.' Their energetic performances and genre-defying style have drawn comparisons to Otis Redding, Captain Beefheart, and Blind Lemon Jefferson, earning them a reputation as one of the most original bands on the blues rock scene. Their legacy is marked by a commitment to keeping blues vibrant and relevant, inspiring both audiences and fellow musicians.[1][3][4]
