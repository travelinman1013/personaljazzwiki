## Biography
The Modern Jazz Quartet (MJQ) was formed in 1952, evolving from the rhythm section of Dizzy Gillespie’s big band, which featured pianist John Lewis, vibraphonist Milt Jackson, bassist Ray Brown, and drummer Kenny Clarke. After Brown’s departure, Percy Heath joined on bass, and in 1955, Connie Kay replaced Clarke on drums. The group became known for their refined presentation—performing in tuxedos and concert halls—and for their disciplined professionalism, a stark contrast to the prevailing jazz stereotypes of the era[1][2][3][4].

MJQ’s music was a sophisticated blend of jazz and classical influences, with John Lewis’s interest in baroque forms leading to compositions that incorporated fugues and counterpoint. Their repertoire included original works like “Django” and “Concorde,” jazz standards, and classical-inspired pieces such as 'The Comedy' and the film score 'No Sun in Venice.' The group’s sound was marked by Lewis’s sparse, bluesy piano, Jackson’s soulful vibraphone, Heath’s melodic bass, and Kay’s subtle drumming, creating an elegant and distinctive style that bridged bebop, cool jazz, and the so-called 'third stream' movement[2][4][6].

Over their 43-year career (with a brief hiatus), the MJQ became a major jazz institution, influencing generations of musicians and expanding the possibilities for jazz ensembles. Their legacy is one of innovation, discipline, and a unique fusion of jazz improvisation with classical structure, making them one of the most respected and enduring groups in jazz history[1][2][4].

## Fun Facts
- The Modern Jazz Quartet was renowned for their formal dress and punctuality, rarely seen in jazz groups of their era—they always performed in tuxedos and were never late for a gig[1][2].
- Their signature composition 'Django' is a tribute to the legendary gypsy guitarist Django Reinhardt[2][4].
- The group took a seven-year hiatus from 1974 to 1981, but reunited with the original lineup (except for the late Connie Kay, who was replaced by Mickey Roker for some performances)[1][2].
- MJQ’s 1957 album 'Third Stream Music' was one of the first to explicitly merge jazz and classical elements, helping to popularize the term 'third stream'[4].
