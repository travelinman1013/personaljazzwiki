## Biography
Gregory (Greg) Lewis, widely known by the moniker **Organ Monk**, is a New York–born keyboardist and Hammond organist who has become a prominent voice on the city’s jazz, blues, and funk scenes.[2][3][5] Raised in a musical family, he first encountered jazz through his late father, pianist David Lewis, whose record collection—especially Thelonious Monk LPs—sparked his fascination with Monk’s sound and compositional language.[2][5] Growing up in Long Island City during the heyday of soul and funk, Lewis absorbed those grooves alongside jazz, eventually beginning formal piano studies at age eleven and working professionally around New York as a teenager.[1][2][5]

Lewis studied in the jazz program at The New School, where pianist Gil Coggins became a pivotal mentor and helped redirect him from piano to the Hammond B-3 organ by sending him to sub on a gig that unexpectedly featured the organ instead of a piano.[1][2][5][7] Deeply inspired by Larry Young’s organ rendition of “Monk’s Dream” and by Jimmy Smith and Sly Stone, he committed himself to exploring Monk’s music on the organ, ultimately adopting the stage name Organ Monk to reflect that mission.[1][2][7] Leading his Organ Monk trio, quartet, and quintet in long-running residencies at Brooklyn’s Night of the Cookers and beyond, he released a series of albums dedicated largely to Monk’s music and to reimagined American songbook material, as well as socially engaged projects such as *The Breathe Suite* (2017), which responds to racial injustice.[2][7] By the 2010s and 2020s he had been recognized as a key Hammond voice, inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame as a “Great Blues Artist from New York” in 2012, named the #1 Rising Star for Organ in DownBeat’s 72nd Annual Critics Poll, and spotlighted for his 2023 Sunnyside Records release *Organ Monk Going Home*, which was selected as a New York City Jazz Record “Best of 2023” and received four stars in DownBeat’s Editors’ Picks.[1]

Musically, Lewis is known for a vigorous, harmonically probing style that combines the angularity and rhythmic displacements of Thelonious Monk with the swirling textures and dramatic sweeps of classic Hammond organ jazz.[2][7] Critics have described him as both an heir to the 1960s organ innovators and an original voice who pushes Monk’s repertoire into groove‑oriented, blues‑saturated territory, often collaborating with adventurous guitarists and drummers to amplify the music’s bite and intensity.[2] Through his Organ Monk projects and his work with leading vocalists and instrumentalists, he has carved out a distinctive niche in contemporary jazz and blues, extending Monk’s legacy into the organ tradition while contributing to New York’s broader creative music ecosystem.[1][2][7]

## Fun Facts
- Lewis earned the nickname and artistic persona “Organ Monk” because of his deep specialization in and long‑term dedication to interpreting Thelonious Monk’s compositions on the Hammond organ.[1][2][7]
- His pivot from piano to Hammond B‑3 happened almost by accident when his mentor Gil Coggins sent him to sub on a gig and he arrived to find a Hammond organ instead of the expected piano, a moment he cites as life‑changing.[1][2][5][7]
- Before stepping out as a leader with his Organ Monk project, Lewis spent years as a first‑call sideman on the New York scene, especially valued by vocalists for his “sensitive and soulful” accompaniment.[2]
- In addition to critical acclaim in jazz, Lewis was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame as a “Great Blues Artist from New York” in 2012, underscoring his strong ties to the city’s blues community as well as its jazz world.[1]
