## Biography
Jaheim H. Hoagland was born on May 26, 1978, in New Brunswick, New Jersey, where he grew up in the Memorial Parkway Homes public housing project. His early life was marked by significant hardship—his father died when he was only three years old, and his mother passed away during his teenage years. Despite these challenges, music became his refuge and salvation. His grandfather, Victor Hoagland, had performed professionally with renowned groups like The Drifters, and family reunions filled with music provided young Jaheim with his first performance experiences. At age 15, he entered the Apollo Theater's legendary talent shows in Harlem and won the competition three times, establishing himself as a promising young talent.

Jaheim's professional music career began in 2000 when he was signed by Naughty by Nature's Kaygee to Divine Mill Records (a division of Warner Bros. Records). He released his debut album *Ghetto Love* in 2001, which introduced his smooth R&B style to audiences. His second album, *Still Ghetto* (2002), achieved platinum status and featured hit singles including "Put That Woman First" and "Fabulous." The album's success established him as a rising force in contemporary R&B. His third album, *Ghetto Classics* (2006), marked a commercial peak, debuting at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 and selling over 153,000 copies in its first week.

Throughout his career, Jaheim has demonstrated versatility across multiple record labels and projects. He signed with Atlantic Records in 2007 and released *The Makings of a Man* in December of that year. Subsequent albums including *Another Round* (2010), *Appreciation Day* (2013), and *Struggle Love* (2016) showcased his continued evolution as an artist. In 2014, he restarted his own independent label, Julie's Dream Music Group, and signed with BMG Records in 2015. Blending soulful ballads with infectious dance tracks, Jaheim has sold 5 million records worldwide and earned three Grammy nominations, establishing himself as a significant figure in contemporary R&B and neo-soul music.
