## Biography
En Vogue is an American vocal girl group formed in Oakland, California, in 1989 by producers Denzil Foster and Thomas McElroy. The original lineup—Terry Ellis, Dawn Robinson, Cindy Herron, and Maxine Jones—was selected after extensive auditions, with the group initially conceived as a trio before Ellis joined to complete the quartet. Foster and McElroy envisioned a modern-day girl group inspired by the vocal traditions of the 1950s and 1960s, particularly The Supremes, but with a contemporary R&B, new jack swing, and hip-hop edge. Their debut album, 'Born to Sing' (1990), featured the hit single 'Hold On,' which reached No. 2 on the US Hot 100 and helped establish En Vogue as a major force in pop and R&B music.[1][2][5][6]

Throughout the 1990s, En Vogue became known for their powerful harmonies, sophisticated image, and a string of chart-topping singles such as 'My Lovin’ (You’re Never Gonna Get It),' 'Free Your Mind,' and 'Don’t Let Go (Love).' Their second album, 'Funky Divas' (1992), solidified their reputation, earning multi-platinum status and critical acclaim. The group was notable for sharing lead vocals among all members, breaking the mold of a single frontwoman and emphasizing collective talent. Despite lineup changes and brief hiatuses, En Vogue has continued to record and perform, with current members Cindy Herron-Braggs, Terry Ellis, and Rhona Bennett.[1][3][5]

En Vogue’s legacy lies in their blend of classic girl group sensibilities with modern R&B and hip-hop, influencing a generation of vocal groups and female artists. They are recognized as one of the top-selling American female groups, lauded for their vocal prowess, style, and empowerment themes. Their impact is reflected in their continued popularity, collaborations with contemporary artists, and recognition as pioneers in the evolution of R&B and pop music.[1][3][5][6]
