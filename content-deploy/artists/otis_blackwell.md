## Biography
Otis Blackwell (February 16, 1931 – May 6, 2002) was an American songwriter, singer, and pianist whose work profoundly shaped the sound of rock and roll. Born in Brooklyn, New York, Blackwell began his musical journey in the late 1940s, working as a pants presser while writing songs and performing in local clubs and theaters. His early break came at age 21 when he won an amateur contest at the Apollo Theater in Harlem, leading to his first recording, 'Daddy Rollin' Stone.'[4][7]

Though Blackwell initially pursued a performing career, he soon found his true calling in songwriting. By the mid-1950s, he had settled into writing, and his compositions quickly gained traction. His first major success came with 'Fever,' recorded by Little Willie John and later a pop hit for Peggy Lee. Blackwell's partnership with Elvis Presley began in 1956 with 'Don't Be Cruel,' a song that defined the new synthesis of rock and roll and became one of Presley's biggest hits. He went on to write other Presley classics such as 'All Shook Up,' 'Return to Sender' (with Winfield Scott), and 'One Broken Heart for Sale.' Blackwell also penned hits for Jerry Lee Lewis ('Great Balls of Fire,' 'Breathless') and Jimmy Jones ('Handy Man'), contributing to a catalog of over 1,000 songs and nearly 200 million record sales worldwide.[2][4][1][3]

Blackwell's musical style blended rhythm and blues, rockabilly, and pop, characterized by catchy melodies and energetic rhythms. His influence extended far beyond his own recordings, as his songs became staples for a generation of rock and roll artists. Despite his enormous impact, Blackwell remained largely behind the scenes, often writing under the pseudonym John Davenport due to publishing disputes. In his later years, he returned to performing, notably singing 'Don't Be Cruel' on Late Night with David Letterman in 1984. He spent his final years in Nashville, where he died in 2002, leaving a legacy as one of the architects of modern rock and roll.[2][3][4]

## Fun Facts
- Blackwell wrote under the pseudonym 'John Davenport' due to publishing contract disputes, most notably for the hit 'Fever.'[2][3]
- Despite writing several of Elvis Presley's biggest hits, Blackwell never met Presley in person, reportedly due to a superstition.[2]
- He performed his own hit 'Don't Be Cruel' on Late Night with David Letterman in 1984, decades after its release.[2][3]
- Blackwell's songs have sold nearly 200 million records worldwide, and his catalog includes over 1,000 compositions.[4]
