## Biography
Israel Vibration is a reggae harmony group formed in the 1970s by Lascelle 'Wiss' Bulgin (born 1955), Albert 'Apple Gabriel' Craig (born 1955), and Cecil 'Skelly' Spence (born 1952), all from Kingston, Jamaica, who contracted polio during a 1950s epidemic and first met as children at the Mona Rehabilitation Clinic.[1][2][3] Adopting Rastafarian faith as teenagers, they were expelled from the clinic, turned to street singing for survival, and formed the group, initially named 'Israel Vibration Israel Vibrates,' inspired by their harmonic 'vibrating' style and affiliation with the Twelve Tribes of Israel.[1][4][6] Their debut single 'Why Worry' (1976) on the Twelve Tribes label led to support slots with Dennis Brown, Inner Circle, and Bob Marley, followed by the successful album 'The Same Song' (1978) produced by Tommy Cowan, backed by Inner Circle members, and its dub version, gaining international acclaim via EMI's Harvest reissue.[1][4]

The group released 'Unconquered People' (1980) before disputes with producer Henry 'Junjo' Lawes stalled their next project; they relocated to New York in 1982 for health care and to escape the dancehall shift, leading to a split and solo attempts, including Bulgin's 'Mr Sunshine' (1985).[1][2] Reuniting in 1987 at the insistence of RAS Records founder Gary 'Dr. Dread' Himmelfarb, who emphasized unity, they recorded 'Strength of My Life' backed by the Roots Radics, launching a prolific era with over a dozen albums on RAS into the 21st century.[1][5][6] Apple Gabriel departed in 1997 for a solo career, after which Skelly and Wiss continued as Israel Vibration with the Roots Radics, earning a 2010 Grammy nomination for 'Reggae Knights' and maintaining a lasting roots reggae legacy defined by harmonious vocals, spiritual Rastafarian lyrics, and resilience.[4]

## Fun Facts
- The group formed after being thrown out of the Mona Rehabilitation Clinic for adhering to Rastafari teachings, inspiring their earliest songs written while homeless.[1][6]
- Their name derives from their distinctive rotating lead vocal harmonies that create a 'vibrating' effect, combined with ties to the Twelve Tribes of Israel Rastafarian group.[1][6]
- In 1987, RAS Records' Dr. Dread rejected their solo pitches but signed them only if they reunited, citing Marcus Garvey's 'Unity is strength.'[1][6]
- They survived early years singing on Kingston streets and got break-out gigs opening for Bob Marley, Dennis Brown, and Inner Circle.[1]
