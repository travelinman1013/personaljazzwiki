## Biography
Kenny Garrett is an acclaimed American jazz saxophonist and composer, born in Detroit, Michigan, a city with a rich jazz tradition that deeply shaped his musical identity. From an early age, Garrett was immersed in music, encouraged by his father to develop a unique sound—a lesson that became foundational to his artistic voice[3]. He honed his craft not through formal conservatory training, but by immersing himself in Detroit’s vibrant jazz scene, learning directly from local legends like trumpeter Marcus Belgrave, who mentored a generation of Motor City musicians[1]. Garrett’s early professional experiences included playing in the Duke Ellington Orchestra under Mercer Ellington, a formative period that exposed him to the legacy of one of jazz’s greatest bandleaders[6].

Garrett’s career took off in the 1980s when he moved to New York City, quickly establishing himself as a sought-after sideman and collaborator with jazz giants such as Art Blakey, Miles Davis, and Freddie Hubbard[1][2]. His tenure with Miles Davis in the late 1980s was particularly influential, offering him the freedom to explore extended solos and innovative approaches to improvisation[1]. As a bandleader, Garrett is known for his melodic inventiveness, rhythmic intensity, and ability to blend post-bop traditions with global influences and modern jazz fusion. Albums like Black Hope (1992) and Sounds from the Ancestors (2021) showcase his compositional depth and commitment to honoring his musical forebears while pushing the genre forward[1][6]. Garrett’s legacy is marked by his role as both a torchbearer for jazz’s past and a mentor to its future, consistently surrounding himself with elder statesmen and nurturing the next generation of musicians[1][2].
