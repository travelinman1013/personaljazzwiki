## Biography
Leroy Carr was born on March 27, 1905, in Nashville, Tennessee, to John Carr, a laborer at Vanderbilt University, and Katie Lytle, a domestic worker. After his parents separated, he moved to Indianapolis, Indiana, with his mother, where he became a self-taught pianist. Carr's early life included stints in a traveling circus, the U.S. Army, and jail, and he honed his skills playing at local rent parties and in African American clubs in 'Naptown,' developing a sophisticated, urban-influenced piano and vocal style amid the city's burgeoning blues scene.[1][2][5]

In the 1920s, Carr formed a longtime partnership with guitarist Scrapper Blackwell, whose melodic jazz guitar complemented Carr's light bluesy piano and laid-back crooning technique. They recorded for Vocalion Records starting in 1928, with their debut hit 'How Long, How Long Blues' propelling them to national stardom. Carr's music blended soulful poetry, wry humor, and a lilting swing that shifted to driving boogie-woogie, creating a hip, urban club style that attracted a sophisticated black audience. Prolific between 1928 and 1935, he produced hits like 'When the Sun Goes Down,' 'Blues Before Sunrise,' and 'Midnight Hour Blues,' later signing with Victor's Bluebird imprint.[1][2][6]

Plagued by severe alcohol addiction and a bootlegging operation, Carr's career ended abruptly. His final session on February 25, 1935, in Chicago saw Blackwell storm out, leaving Carr to record 'Six Cold Feet in the Ground' solo. He died on April 29, 1935, at age 30 from nephritis, likely related to alcoholism, and was buried in Floral Park Cemetery in Indianapolis. Inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1982, Carr's urban sophistication influenced blues and beyond.[1][2][6]

## Fun Facts
- Carr ran a modest bootlegging operation in Indianapolis, tying into his severe alcohol addiction that contributed to his early death.
- During his final 1935 recording session, partner Scrapper Blackwell stormed out due to Carr's temperamental behavior, leaving him to record 'Six Cold Feet in the Ground' solo.
- Music historian Elijah Wald called Carr 'the most influential male blues singer and songwriter of the first half of the 20th century,' despite him not fitting the rural blues stereotype.
- After Carr's death, Scrapper Blackwell wrote 'My Old Pal Blues' as a tribute, and other musicians penned similar laments highlighting his wide impact.
