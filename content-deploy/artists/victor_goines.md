## Biography
Victor Louis Goines, born on August 6, 1961, in New Orleans, Louisiana, began studying clarinet at age eight and graduated from St. Augustine High School before earning a Bachelor of Music Education from Loyola University in New Orleans in 1984 and a Master of Music from Virginia Commonwealth University in 1990.[1][3][6] A master of saxophone and clarinet, Goines developed his style rooted in traditional New Orleans jazz, big band, and avant-garde influences, performing with legends like Dizzy Gillespie, Lionel Hampton, Freddie Hubbard, Ray Charles, Bob Dylan, and Stevie Wonder early in his career.[2][4] Since 1993, he has been a core member of the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra and Wynton Marsalis Septet, contributing to over 20 recordings including the Pulitzer Prize-winning Blood on the Fields (1997), soundtracks for Ken Burns documentaries like Jazz (1999), and numerous Blue Engine Records releases such as Live in Cuba (2015) and Handful of Keys (2017).[1][3]

As a leader, Goines has released ten albums, including Genesis (AFO, 1992), A Dance at the Mardi Gras Ball (2016, Rosemary Joseph Records), and New Adventures (Criss Cross, 2006), showcasing his compositional prowess with over 200 original works and commissions like Untamed Elegance (2016) and Crescent City (2014) for Jazz at Lincoln Center.[1][2][3] His career blends performance, composition, and education; he served as artistic director of Juilliard's jazz program (2000-2007), expanding it to offer formal degrees, and as director of jazz studies at Northwestern University (2008-2022), alongside faculty roles at Florida A&M, University of New Orleans, Loyola, and Xavier University.[1][2][3] In September 2022, he became President and CEO of Jazz St. Louis, continuing his legacy as an educator and administrator.[1][3][4]

Goines' musical style reflects his New Orleans heritage, emphasizing swing, improvisation, and ensemble interplay, while his enduring commitment to jazz education has shaped generations of musicians through clinics, workshops, and program development worldwide.[1][2][5]
