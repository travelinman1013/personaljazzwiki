## Biography
Dennis Binder, born on November 18, 1928, in Rosedale, Mississippi, is a self-taught American rhythm & blues pianist, singer, and songwriter. His earliest musical experiences came from singing gospel with his mother and aunts in their Baptist church, followed by exposure to the vibrant juke joint culture of the Mississippi Delta. Binder’s initial introduction to the piano and blues came from a performer known as 'Toots,' who played in the St. Louis style and encouraged Dennis’s early interest in the instrument.

As a teenager, Binder moved to Chicago, where he honed his piano technique and immersed himself in the city’s bustling blues scene. He spent time at Chess Records and recorded for both Chess and Sun Records in the early 1950s. In 1954, he collaborated with Ike Turner in Clarksdale, Mississippi, recording sessions for Modern Records where Binder was the featured vocalist and arranger, though the tracks were released under Turner’s name. Binder’s career spanned several decades and regions, with recording sessions at Norman Petty Studios in Texas (alongside Buddy Holly and Tommy Allsup) and later in Oklahoma City. He eventually settled in Lawton, Oklahoma, where he balanced music with work as a bail bondsman and continued to record and perform, releasing albums on his own label and later with Earwig Music Company. His 2006 album 'Hole In That Jug' showcases his unique blend of blues, rock ‘n’ roll, country, and gospel influences.

Binder’s legacy is marked by his versatility and longevity, performing at major festivals and clubs across the United States, Canada, Europe, and Thailand well into his later years. He is celebrated for his energetic performances, distinctive piano style, and his role in bridging blues traditions with emerging genres like rock ‘n’ roll.
