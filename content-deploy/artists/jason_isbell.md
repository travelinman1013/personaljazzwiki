## Biography
Jason Isbell is an American singer-songwriter and guitarist, born February 1, 1979, in Green Hill, Alabama, near Muscle Shoals[1][2]. He began playing music at a young age, performing at the Grand Ole Opry by age 16 and securing a publishing deal with FAME Studios at 21, where he worked as a songwriter and session musician[6][5]. Isbell's early exposure to the legendary Muscle Shoals music scene, known for its soul and roots rock heritage, deeply influenced his songwriting and musical sensibilities.

In 2001, Isbell joined the acclaimed Southern rock band Drive-By Truckers, contributing to three of their albums over six years and earning recognition for his vivid storytelling and guitar work[1][3][7]. After leaving the band in 2007, he launched a solo career, releasing 'Sirens of the Ditch' and soon forming his backing group, the 400 Unit, comprised of fellow Muscle Shoals musicians[2][6]. His 2013 album 'Southeastern' marked a personal and artistic breakthrough, chronicling themes of addiction, redemption, and vulnerability. The album and its signature song "Cover Me Up" garnered widespread critical acclaim, multiple Americana Music Awards, and established Isbell as a leading figure in Americana and alt-country music[1][2][3].

Isbell's subsequent albums, including 'Something More Than Free,' 'The Nashville Sound,' and 'Weathervanes,' have continued to receive commercial and critical success, earning him six Grammy Awards and solidifying his reputation for honest, literate songwriting[1][2][6]. His music blends alt-country, Americana, roots rock, and red dirt influences, often exploring Southern identity, personal struggle, and social commentary. Beyond music, Isbell has also appeared in film and television, notably in Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' (2023)[1].
