## Biography
Joe Hill Louis, born Lester (or Leslie) Hill on September 23, 1921, in Raines, Tennessee (now part of Memphis), emerged as one of the few commercially recorded one-man blues bands of the 1950s. After leaving home at 14 to work for a wealthy Memphis family, he earned the nickname 'Joe Louis' following a victorious childhood fight, referencing the famed boxer. By the late 1940s, Louis had become a fixture in Memphis, performing as a multi-instrumentalist—most notably on harmonica, guitar, and drums—at venues like Handy Park and on the influential radio station WDIA, where he hosted a 15-minute show as 'The Pepticon Boy.'

Louis made his recording debut for Columbia Records in 1949, but his most significant output came through a variety of independent labels, including Modern, Checker, Meteor, and especially Sun Records, where he recorded both as a solo artist and as a session musician. His 1950 single 'Boogie in the Park' is particularly notable for its raw, overdriven guitar sound and is considered a precursor to later electric blues and even heavy metal. Louis also contributed guitar to Rufus Thomas's 'Bear Cat' and co-wrote 'Tiger Man,' later recorded by Thomas and Elvis Presley. Throughout the 1950s, he was a popular live act in Memphis, known for his energetic one-man band performances and innovative use of amplification and distortion.

Louis's career was tragically cut short when he died at age 35 in Memphis on August 5, 1957, from tetanus after a thumb injury became infected. Despite his brief life, his pioneering electric blues style, technical innovations, and role in the Memphis music scene left a lasting legacy, influencing both contemporaries and future generations of blues and rock musicians.

## Fun Facts
- Joe Hill Louis was known as 'The Be-Bop Boy' and recorded under the pseudonym 'Chicago Sunny Boy' for Meteor Records in 1953.
- His single 'Boogie in the Park' was the only release on Sam Phillips's first label before founding Sun Records.
- Louis was a true one-man band, often performing guitar, harmonica, and drums simultaneously during live shows and recordings.
- He died tragically young at age 35 from tetanus after a thumb injury became infected.

## Musical Connections

### Mentors/Influences
