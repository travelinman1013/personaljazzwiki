## Biography
Thisbe Vos is a Dutch jazz singer and songwriter renowned for her romantic, classic jazz style reminiscent of the 1930s to 1950s. Born in Laren, The Netherlands, she developed an early passion for jazz after hearing the genre in television commercials. At age 17, she joined the UK’s leading swing band, The Jive Aces, becoming their first female singer and touring extensively across Europe and the United States. These formative years exposed her to a wide range of musical influences and inspired her to begin writing original songs in the classic jazz tradition.

In 2008, Vos relocated to Los Angeles to pursue her solo career, recording her debut album with a blend of jazz standards and original compositions. She quickly became integrated into the Los Angeles jazz scene, thanks in part to mentorship from acclaimed bassist Henry Franklin. Over the years, she has released five studio albums on her own label, Prime Records, with her music receiving airplay on over 230 jazz radio stations and placements in numerous television shows and films. Vos’s songwriting draws inspiration from legends such as Ella Fitzgerald, George & Ira Gershwin, Cole Porter, and Irving Berlin. Her work has been recognized with several awards, including the International Music & Entertainment Association’s Jazz Song of the Year and Holiday Album of the Year. Through her dedication to classic jazz, she has built a global following and contributed to the genre’s ongoing revival.
