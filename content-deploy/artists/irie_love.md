## Biography
Irie Love Taylor, born on July 7, 1982, in Kailua, Honolulu County, Hawaii, is an American R&B reggae singer and songwriter of Hawaiian, Jamaican, Dutch, English, and Native American descent. Her father was a former NFL linebacker, and she descends from Robert Love, founder of Love's Bakery in Hawaii. Encouraged by her mother to sing solos at her family church, she initially dreamed of a professional basketball career, attending Kalaheo High School, but an injury shifted her focus to music. In 1999, at age 17, she gained early recognition as a finalist in Honolulu's 'Brown Bags to Stardom' competition, leading to a signing with Quiet Storm Records by judge John Iervolino; she was featured as the only new artist on the compilation *Roots Music Volume 2: Private Beach Party*.[1][7]

In 2000, Love moved to Los Angeles to study Music and Business at Azusa Pacific University, where she began touring as a backup singer for artists like Pink (2002), Dave Hollister, and Chaka Khan through 2005. Relocating to Kingston, Jamaica in 2006, she became a finalist in the Irie FM Red Stripe Big Break Competition and connected with reggae group Morgan Heritage at East Fest in St. Thomas, leading to her signing with their production company, Gedion Music, in 2007. She toured globally as their opening act and backup singer across the US, Caribbean, South America, Africa, Europe, and the UK, alongside their brother Laza. Her debut EP *Ehiku* launched in Waikiki in October 2008, followed by her first international album *The Life of Love* in Japan in 2009. She contributed to compilations like *The Biggest Reggae One-Drop Anthems 2008* and released her 2012 Hawaiian reggae album *This is Irie Love*, with No. 1 charting singles 'It Is Wut It Is' (feat. Fiji) and 'My Love' on Hawaiian Reggae Charts.[1][2]

After a rising career, Love took a five-year hiatus around 2017 due to personal tragedy and reflection, stepping away from the spotlight. She returned in 2022 with the single 'In Another Life,' performing at venues like Blue Note Hawaii. Standing six feet tall, she blends ragga-soul, reggae, and R&B styles, has worked as a model and actress, and continues under labels like Quiet Storm Records and Gedion Music, active since 1999.[1][2][3][5]
