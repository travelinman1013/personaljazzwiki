## Biography
Herman Parker Jr., known as Little Junior Parker or 'Mr. Blues,' was born on March 27, 1932, near Bobo, Mississippi, or in Clarksdale, Mississippi/West Memphis, Arkansas, and grew up in West Memphis, Arkansas. He sang in gospel groups as a child and began playing on blues circuits in his teenage years, influenced heavily by harmonica master Sonny Boy Williamson II (Rice Miller), with whom he worked before joining Howlin' Wolf's band in 1949. Around 1950, he performed with Memphis's Beale Streeters alongside Bobby 'Blue' Bland and B.B. King, marking his entry into the vibrant Memphis blues scene.[1][3][5]

In 1951, Parker formed Little Junior's Blue Flames with guitarist Auburn 'Pat' Hare and later Floyd Murphy (brother of Matt 'Guitar' Murphy). Discovered by Ike Turner in 1952, he recorded his debut 'You're My Angel' for Modern Records, leading to a Sun Records contract in 1953. There, the band scored hits like 'Feelin' Good' (R&B #5), 'Love My Baby,' and 'Mystery Train,' blending electric Memphis blues with proto-rockabilly energy; Elvis Presley later covered 'Mystery Train' and borrowed riffs from 'Love My Baby.' Parker joined Duke Records in 1953/1955, touring with Bland in the Blues Consolidated Revue and releasing R&B hits like 'Next Time You See Me' (1957), 'Sweet Home Chicago' (1958), and 'Driving Wheel' (1961).[1][2][3]

Parker's velvet-smooth, honeyed voice defined his soul-blues style, bridging blues, R&B, and early rock. After leaving Duke in 1966, success waned despite recordings for Mercury, Capitol, and others. He died on November 18, 1971, aged 39, in Blue Island, Illinois, during brain tumor surgery, and was posthumously inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 2001.[1][3]
