## Biography
Mike, Peggy, and Penny Seeger were three siblings from a prominent musical family who became influential figures in the American folk music revival of the 1950s and 1960s. Born to Charles Seeger, a renowned musicologist, and growing up in Washington, D.C., the three siblings were immersed in folk music from childhood. Though their father offered formal musical training, the Seegers largely developed their own approaches to traditional music, becoming self-taught multi-instrumentalists who rejected rigid classical instruction in favor of learning directly from field recordings and live performances of old-time musicians. In 1957, Mike, Peggy, and Penny recorded together with their sister Barbara on the influential album American Folk Songs for Children on Folkways Records, which showcased their deep knowledge of traditional American repertoire and established them as serious interpreters of folk traditions rather than commercial entertainers.

Mike Seeger emerged as the most prominent of the three siblings, co-founding The New Lost City Ramblers in 1958 with John Cohen and Tom Paley, a group that became instrumental in revitalizing interest in pre-bluegrass "old time" music. His meticulous approach to learning from 1920s and 1930s recordings, combined with his mastery of numerous instruments including banjo, fiddle, guitar, autoharp, mandolin, and harmonica, made him a distinctive voice in folk music. Peggy Seeger also achieved significant recognition, becoming one of the leading voices of the Anglo-American folk revival and later settling in London in 1959, where she collaborated extensively with playwright and singer Ewan MacColl and co-founded the Critics Group. Penny Seeger, while less publicly prominent than her siblings, contributed to the family's musical legacy and later married John Cohen of The New Lost City Ramblers, further cementing the family's influence within folk music circles.

The Seeger siblings' collective legacy rests on their unwavering commitment to documenting, preserving, and authentically performing traditional American music at a time when commercial folk music was becoming increasingly pop-oriented. Their work as field recordists, performers, and educators helped rescue obscure musicians from obscurity and inspired generations of folk musicians to investigate the rich musical traditions of America's past. Mike received six Grammy nominations and a 2009 National Heritage Fellowship, while Peggy became known for her songwriting, including the feminist anthem "I'm Gonna Be an Engineer," demonstrating how the Seeger siblings extended their influence beyond preservation into creative innovation.
