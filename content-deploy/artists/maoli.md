## Biography
Maoli, the stage name of Glenn Awong, is a Hawaiian-born singer-songwriter and bandleader from upcountry Maui who has become one of Hawaii and Polynesia's most successful independent recording artists.[1][2] Born on the northern shore of Maui, Awong discovered his musical talents during a seventh-grade ukulele class, where he developed a distinctive vocal range described as smooth and soulful.[4] Though he initially pursued other work, including construction, his uncle encouraged him to return to music, leading him to record groove-laced covers and eventually hit the road, building a committed fanbase that stretched from the Hawaiian islands across Polynesia, the American West Coast, and as far east as Texas.[4]

Formed officially in 2007, Maoli has evolved into a genre-defying act that fuses country, R&B, soul, acoustics, rock and roll, and reggae into what has been labeled "Country Reggae."[1] The band's breakthrough came around 2018 when mainland friends pointed out the similarities between Maoli's music and modern country music—from swaying melodies and solid rhythms to simple-life storytelling and steel guitars.[4] This realization sparked a creative renaissance, with Maoli releasing a series of innovative albums and viral singles, including emotionally-charged covers of Brett Young's "Mercy" (18+ million Spotify streams) and "In Case You Didn't Know" (10+ million Spotify streams).[2] With nine independent albums and over half a billion global streams accumulated through a nearly 15-year recording and touring career, Maoli has established himself as a fixture across the Pacific islands and beyond, selling out major venues in Hawaii and performing across the U.S., New Zealand, Australia, and the South Pacific.[1][2]

Beyond his musical achievements, Maoli has earned numerous accolades including a 2020 Nā Hōkū Hanohano Award for Reggae Album of the Year, iHeart Island Music Awards for Album of the Year and Group of the Year in 2020, and Album of the Year and Song of the Year in 2021.[3] The artist's name itself carries cultural significance—"Maoli" means "native" in Hawaiian, reflecting Awong's commitment to representing his culture and people on the global stage.[3] His 2023 Maoli Music Overload (MMO) tour demonstrated his commercial reach, selling over 45,000 tickets across four Hawaiian cities and 11,500 tickets on the mainland US tour, plus festival appearances including Cali Roots and Holo Holo Fest Sacramento.[1]

## Fun Facts
- Maoli's first performances were so poorly attended that he and his collaborators couldn't even sell 20 tickets at the Pagoda lobby in Honolulu; over 13 years later, his shows at the Tom Moffatt Waikiki Shell drew over 25,000 people, with the first show selling out in just 8 minutes.[3]
- The artist discovered his musical talent during a seventh-grade ukulele class and initially left music behind to work construction before his uncle encouraged him to return to performing.[4]
- Maoli's 2023 Maoli Music Overload (MMO) tour was so successful that it sold more than 45,000 tickets across just four cities in Hawaii alone, plus an additional 11,500 tickets on the mainland US tour.[1]
- The name 'Maoli' means 'native' in Hawaiian, deliberately chosen by Glenn Awong to represent his culture and identity no matter where he performs in the world.[3]
