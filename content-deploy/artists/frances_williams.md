## Biography
Francis Williams (1910–1983) was an American jazz trumpeter born on September 20, 1910, in McConnell's Mill, Pennsylvania. He began his career in the 1930s with Frank Terry's Chicago Nightingales and moved to New York City in 1940, where he quickly established himself in the jazz scene by playing with prominent bands led by Fats Waller, Claude Hopkins, Edgar Hayes, Ella Fitzgerald, Sabby Lewis, and Machito during the early 1940s.[1]

From 1945 to 1949, and again in 1951, Williams was a key member of Duke Ellington's orchestra, contributing to numerous recordings and performances as part of the trumpet section. In the 1950s and 1960s, he shifted focus to Latin jazz ensembles and New York theater bands, while also performing with Clyde Bernhardt and the Harlem Blues and Jazz Band, and leading his own quartet. His style was rooted in big band jazz, with a versatile trumpet technique suited to swing and Latin influences.[1][3]

Williams continued performing until late in life, working with drummer Panama Francis near the end. He passed away on October 2, 1983, in Houston, Pennsylvania, at age 73, leaving a legacy as a reliable sideman in major jazz orchestras.[1]
