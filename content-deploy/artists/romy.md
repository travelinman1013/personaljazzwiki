## Biography
Romy Madley Croft is a British singer, songwriter, and DJ best known as the frontwoman and guitarist of the electronic band The xx, which she formed with Oliver Sim and Jamie Smith while attending secondary school in south-west London over two decades ago. The xx gained international recognition in the late 2000s for their distinctive sparse, bass-forward productions and gothic electro-rock sound, with breakthrough tracks like 'Crystalised', 'Islands', and 'Intro' becoming defining songs of the era. Beyond her work with The xx, Madley Croft has maintained a parallel passion for DJing, beginning at age 16 or 17 in Soho's queer club scene, where she found both creative fulfillment and personal identity in the celebratory dance music community.

After The xx completed their third album tour, Madley Croft embarked on a solo career, releasing her debut single 'Lifetime' in 2020 and her full-length album 'Mid Air' in September 2022. Her solo work represents a significant departure from The xx's moody aesthetic, embracing uplifting pop-dance and trance-influenced production that draws heavily from 1990s and 2000s dance music. The album, largely written and conceived during lockdown, is deeply autobiographical, exploring themes of relationships, grief, and mental health while maintaining the dancefloor energy that has always inspired her. Madley Croft has explicitly stated her goal of creating 'uplifting lesbian pop music,' and her solo project celebrates queer identity and the transformative power of club culture that shaped her formative years.

Throughout her career, Madley Croft has balanced her artistic endeavors with collaborative work, maintaining her connection to The xx while exploring her individual creative voice. She has expressed gratitude for the time spent developing her solo work, noting that it helped her understand herself as an individual artist distinct from the band's collective identity. Her journey reflects a commitment to authentic self-expression, from her early experiences in London's queer club scene to her current position as an established soloist creating music that celebrates both personal liberation and communal joy.

## Fun Facts
- Romy began DJing at age 16 or 17 in Soho's underground queer club scene, initially without any DJ experience—the club manager simply asked if she wanted to try, and she accepted despite not knowing how to DJ.
- She has worked as a production roadie for major touring acts including Dua Lipa, Billie Eilish, P!nk, Coldplay, KISS, and Goo Goo Dolls, combining her passion for live music with behind-the-scenes industry experience.
- The xx's sparse, minimalist production style—which became their signature sound—contrasts sharply with Romy's solo work, which embraces euphoric, maximalist dance production with trance pads and pumping beats.
- Romy has explicitly stated that she initially faced skepticism about her love of pop and dance music, with people asking dismissively if she 'really liked this music,' but she has since embraced it as her authentic artistic voice and primary creative focus.
