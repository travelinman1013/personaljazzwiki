## Biography
Moses Sumney is a Ghanaian-American singer, songwriter, and multidisciplinary artist known for his genre-defying blend of art pop, soul, jazz, and experimental music. Born on May 19, 1991, in San Bernardino, California, Sumney moved with his Ghanaian-born parents back to Ghana at age 10, before returning to Southern California during his teenage years. His early musical exposure ranged from country music in California to soul, pop, and R&B in Ghana, shaping his eclectic taste and approach to songwriting. Despite a deep interest in music from a young age, Sumney was not permitted to play instruments as a child and only taught himself guitar at age 20 while studying at UCLA, where he began performing and writing songs in earnest[2][4][6].

Sumney's career took off with the self-recorded EP 'Mid-City Island' in 2014, followed by the EP 'Lamentations' in 2016. His debut album, 'Aromanticism' (2017), received critical acclaim from major publications like Rolling Stone and The New York Times, establishing him as a unique voice in contemporary music[1][2]. His sophomore album, 'græ' (2020), further cemented his reputation for pushing boundaries, incorporating themes of identity, isolation, and nonconformity. Sumney's music is characterized by intricate vocal layering, falsetto, and minimalist yet emotionally resonant arrangements, often exploring topics of love, solitude, and selfhood[1][2][5].

Beyond music, Sumney has made notable appearances in fashion and film, walking the runway for Burberry and contributing to soundtracks for major films and TV series. His work has influenced a new generation of artists who value authenticity and genre fluidity, and his songs have appeared in shows such as 'Orange is the New Black', 'Westworld', and 'Insecure'[1][4]. Sumney continues to be recognized for his artistic independence and commitment to creative freedom, making a lasting impact on the art pop and indie soul landscape.
