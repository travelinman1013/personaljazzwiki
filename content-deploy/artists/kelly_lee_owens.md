## Biography
Kelly Lee Owens, a Welsh electronic producer, songwriter, vocalist, and former auxiliary nurse, grew up in a small town in north Wales where practical careers like farming dominated, but her daydreaming nature—nicknamed 'Kelly’s World' by her mother—and early passion for music set her apart. In high school, she won certificates for music lover of the year and daydreamer of the year, and began learning bass and drums young. At 13, she worked illegally as a waitress to 'earn her keep,' and by 17, she took a job at Christie's Cancer Hospital in Manchester after moving there to connect with like-minded 'weirdos' in the music scene, while also working in nursing homes in Wales.[1][3][5][6][9]

Transitioning from healthcare, Owens drew inspiration from cancer patients who urged her at 18 to pursue music over regrets they harbored on their deathbeds, prompting her to organize indie festivals during 12-week paid leaves and later move to London. There, a decade in record stores provided an alternative musical education, leading her to synths around age 25, where she discovered the 'humanity in analogue synths.' Her self-titled debut in 2017 marked her breakthrough as a convention-blurring artist blending dream pop-techno, followed by Inner Song (2020), LP8 (2022), and Dreamstate (2024) on dh2, informed by her nursing experiences and research into therapeutic sound frequencies.[2][3][5][7]

Owens' musical style fuses ethereal electronic tones, looped vocals, unique rhythms, drifting moods, and driving club beats, emphasizing intimacy, healing, and self-knowledge gained later in life over youthful haste. Her work reflects a rare female presence in techno, proving her place through graft, with nursing's nurturing ethos paralleling music's life-saving potential.[3][6][7]
