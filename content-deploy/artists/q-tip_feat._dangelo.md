## Biography
Q-Tip, born Kamaal Ibn John Fareed (formerly Jonathan William Davis) on April 10, 1970 in Harlem, New York City, is a foundational figure in East Coast hip hop. He rose to prominence as the principal rapper and producer of A Tribe Called Quest, a group celebrated for its innovative fusion of jazz and hip hop, Afrocentric themes, and positive lyricism. Q-Tip's production style, marked by minimalist beats and intricate sampling, helped define the sound of 1990s hip hop, and his lyrical prowess established him as one of the genre's most respected voices[2][4].

D'Angelo, born Michael Eugene Archer on February 11, 1974 in Richmond, Virginia, is a pioneering neo-soul artist whose work bridges R&B, funk, and hip hop. He began his career producing and rapping in the group I.D.U., later signing with EMI and releasing his acclaimed debut album 'Brown Sugar' in 1995. D'Angelo's rich, soulful vocals and complex arrangements revitalized modern soul music, with subsequent albums like 'Voodoo' and 'Black Messiah' cementing his legacy as a visionary musician[1].

Q-Tip and D'Angelo have collaborated on several occasions, most notably on the song "Believe" from Q-Tip's 2008 album 'The Renaissance.' Their partnership exemplifies the intersection of hip hop and neo-soul, blending Q-Tip's abstract lyricism and production with D'Angelo's emotive, groove-driven style. Both artists are recognized for pushing genre boundaries and influencing a new generation of musicians[5][6].
