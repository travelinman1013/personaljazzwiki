## Biography
Janet Damita Jo Jackson, born on May 16, 1966, in Gary, Indiana, is an award-winning singer, songwriter, actress, and dancer who rose to prominence as a pop and R&B icon. The youngest child of the Jackson family, she began her career in entertainment as a child actress on television shows such as 'Good Times' and 'Diff’rent Strokes' before launching her music career in the early 1980s. Her breakthrough came with the 1986 album 'Control,' which marked her artistic independence and showcased a blend of pop, R&B, funk, and new jack swing. Produced by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, 'Control' topped the charts and established Jackson as a major force in music, with hits like 'What Have You Done for Me Lately' and 'Nasty.' She continued her success with socially conscious albums like 'Rhythm Nation 1814' and later explored more personal and experimental themes in works such as 'The Velvet Rope' and 'All For You.' Known for her innovative music videos, choreography, and socially aware lyrics, Jackson has remained a trailblazer for women in the industry and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2019.
