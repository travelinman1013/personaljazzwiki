## Biography
The Daiquiri Queens are a vibrant Cajun band originating from Lafayette, Louisiana, formed out of close friendships and a shared passion for classic Cajun dance music. The group made their debut at the 2017 South Louisiana Blackpot Festival & Cookoff, quickly establishing themselves as favorites on the Louisiana music scene. Their rise from informal backyard jams to a sought-after act at major festivals such as The New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival and Festival International de Louisiane underscores their appeal and authenticity.

Fronted by guitarists Jamie Lynn Fontenot and Miriam McCracken, The Daiquiri Queens are known for their sibling-like harmonies and energetic performances. The band features seasoned musicians including accordionist John Dowden, fiddler Tysman Charpentier, and drummer Chelsea Moosekian, creating a fresh yet deeply rooted take on traditional Louisiana French music. Their sound is characterized by lively interpretations of dancehall-era two-steps and heartfelt waltzes, all delivered with the group’s signature flair and infectious enthusiasm. Their debut album, produced by Chris Stafford of Feufollet, captures the spirit of their live shows and their commitment to both tradition and innovation in Cajun music.

The Daiquiri Queens have become known for their ability to get crowds dancing and for their dedication to preserving and revitalizing Cajun music.
