## Biography
Idris Muhammad, born Leo Morris on November 13, 1939, in New Orleans, Louisiana, emerged as one of the most innovative and versatile drummers in jazz, funk, and soul. Growing up in the vibrant musical environment of New Orleans, Muhammad began playing drums at age eight and was already performing professionally by his early teens. His early career saw him contributing to landmark R&B recordings, including Fats Domino’s 'Blueberry Hill' and The Hawketts’ 'Mardi Gras Mambo.'

In the 1960s, Muhammad transitioned from R&B to jazz, moving to New York City and quickly becoming a sought-after session musician. He played with Lou Donaldson, Betty Carter, and was the house drummer at Prestige Records, appearing on over 150 albums. His drumming was central to the jazz-funk movement, particularly through his work with artists like Charles Earland and his own acclaimed albums such as 'Power of Soul' (1974). Muhammad's style was marked by a deep groove, inventive hi-hat work, and an ability to blend jazz sophistication with danceable rhythms.

Throughout his career, Muhammad collaborated with a wide range of artists, including Sam Cooke, Jerry Butler, Pharoah Sanders, Ahmad Jamal, and Roberta Flack. His influence extended across genres, helping to shape the sound of soul jazz and jazz-funk. Muhammad’s legacy endures through his recordings, his impact on drummers, and his role in bridging the worlds of jazz, R&B, and funk.
