## Biography
Blackalicious is an American hip-hop duo from Sacramento, California, composed of rapper Gift of Gab (Tim Parker) and DJ/producer Chief Xcel (Xavier Mosley). The duo met in 1987 at John F. Kennedy High School in Sacramento, where they shared a passion for hip-hop. After Gift of Gab graduated in 1989, they parted ways but reunited in 1992 at the University of California, Davis, where they formed Blackalicious. During this period, they were part of the influential Solesides collective, which included DJ Shadow, Lateef the Truthspeaker, and Lyrics Born. This collective later evolved into Quannum Projects, under which Blackalicious released several notable works, including their debut EP *Melodica* in 1995 and their debut full-length album *Nia* in 1999. Blackalicious is known for Gift of Gab's complex, multisyllabic rhymes and Chief Xcel's soulful production, often incorporating themes of spirituality and positivity into their music. The duo released four full-length albums: *Nia* (1999), *Blazing Arrow* (2002), *The Craft* (2005), and *Imani Vol. 1* (2015). Gift of Gab passed away in June 2021, marking the end of an era for the duo. Blackalicious has been praised for their unique blend of alternative and underground hip-hop, contributing significantly to the genre's evolution. Their music often explores themes of personal growth, social awareness, and introspection, resonating with fans seeking more meaningful content in hip-hop. The duo's legacy continues to inspire new generations of artists and fans alike, with their influence evident in the broader hip-hop community's embrace of more experimental and lyrical styles.
