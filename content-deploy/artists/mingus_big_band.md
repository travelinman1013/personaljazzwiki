## Biography
The Mingus Big Band is a 14-piece ensemble based in New York City that was established in 1991 by Sue Mingus, the widow of legendary bassist and composer Charles Mingus[1][6]. Created to honor and perpetuate the musical legacy of Charles Mingus, the band was built upon the foundation of earlier repertory ensembles that Sue Mingus had formed after her husband's death in 1979, including the Mingus Dynasty septet and the 1989 Epitaph orchestra[6]. The ensemble specializes exclusively in performing the compositions of Charles Mingus, featuring new arrangements of his works in the larger big band format that Mingus himself envisioned but was not always able to organize during his lifetime[6].

Since its inception, the Mingus Big Band has become one of the most respected jazz ensembles in the world, touring extensively throughout the United States, Europe, Japan, and beyond[1][4]. The band's approach to Mingus's music remains dynamic and evolving rather than static or reverential; it draws from a rotating roster of established and rising musicians, which ensures fresh interpretations while maintaining the spirit of Mingus's artistic vision[6]. The ensemble has recorded twelve albums, earning seven Grammy Award nominations and winning a Grammy in 2011 for Best Large Jazz Ensemble Album for *Mingus Big Band Live at Jazz Standard*[4][5]. A notable recent release, *The Charles Mingus Centennial Sessions*, was released in October 2022 to commemorate what would have been Charles Mingus's centennial year[5][6].

## Fun Facts
- The Mingus Big Band maintains a constantly rotating roster of musicians rather than a fixed lineup, which Sue Mingus deliberately uses to prevent the repertory from becoming stale or ossified, ensuring fresh artistic approaches to Mingus's compositions[6]
- Charles Mingus composed over three hundred scores and recorded over one hundred albums during his lifetime, providing an extraordinarily vast and varied repertory that the Mingus Big Band continues to explore and reinterpret[2]
- The band performs weekly Wednesday night residencies at DROM NYC in New York City in addition to its extensive international touring schedule[4]
- Charles Mingus's last compositions were sung into a tape recorder during his final years, as he was confined to a wheelchair due to Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and could no longer write music on paper or compose at the piano[2]
