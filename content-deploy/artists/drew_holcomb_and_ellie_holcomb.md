## Biography
Drew Holcomb & Ellie Holcomb are a husband-and-wife Americana and Christian folk duo from Nashville, Tennessee, who have been making music together for over 20 years.[2] Drew Holcomb began his musical career after a formative tragedy—the loss of his brother before college—which inspired him to pursue songwriting.[1] Influenced by artists like David Gray, Damien Rice, Bob Dylan, and Tom Petty, he moved to Memphis and began performing regularly before eventually relocating to Nashville.[1] Ellie Bannister, daughter of renowned music producer Brown Bannister, grew up in Nashville and initially pursued a career in education, earning her master's degree in teacher education and working as an eighth-grade English teacher.[1][3] The couple met as University of Tennessee students at a tailgate barbecue in Knoxville and married in 2006, shortly after which they began touring together.[3][4]

Ellie joined Drew Holcomb and the Neighbors in 2005 as a band member, appearing on early recordings including the 2005 album *Washed in Blue* and the 2007 album *A Million Miles Away*.[2] The band achieved significant recognition with their 2008 album *Passenger Seat*, which became their breakout project.[2] After touring full-time with the band for eight years, Ellie stepped off the road when her first child was born and launched a successful solo career beginning in 2011 with the *Magnolia EP*, followed by her acclaimed debut studio album *As Sure as the Sun* in 2014, for which she was named Best New Artist at the 2014 GMA Dove Awards.[3][6] Her second full-length album, *Red Sea Road* (2017), was produced by her father and served as a creative outlet during his battle with cancer.[3] In 2025, Drew and Ellie released their first full-length duo album together as equal fronting artists, *Memory Bank*, marking a new chapter in their collaborative journey.[2][7] Over their careers, they have amassed more than a hundred million streams and built a devoted following through their honest, faith-centered songwriting and live performances.[2]

## Fun Facts
- Drew and Ellie met at a pregame tailgate barbecue in Knoxville when Drew impressed Ellie by mentioning he had just soloed for the first time while getting his pilot's license; they didn't see each other again for seven months before reconnecting at another party.[1]
- Ellie initially swore she would never become a professional musician or marry a musician, believing that pursuing music required sacrificing family and home, but she accidentally launched a music career after becoming pregnant and writing 45 faith-focused songs in nine months.[1]
- During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Tennessee state government asked Drew and Ellie to travel across the state in an Airstream with their children, write songs around a campfire at night, and film the process—resulting in some of their favorite collaborative work, including 'Feels Like Home' which name-checks Dolly Parton and earned them a standing ovation from Dolly herself at an award ceremony.[1]
- Ellie began her musical journey by singing in the stairwell of her college dorm during heartbreak, which attracted other students to listen; this experience taught her that music serves as a bridge-builder connecting people through shared stories.[5]
