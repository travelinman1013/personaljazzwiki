## Biography
Marcia Llyneth Griffiths, born on November 23, 1949, in West Kingston, Jamaica, is widely celebrated as the 'Empress of Reggae.' She began her professional singing career in 1964 after being discovered by Phillip 'Boasie' James of The Blues Busters, who invited her to perform with Byron Lee and the Dragonaires. Her talent quickly attracted the attention of leading producers, and she chose to record for Clement 'Coxsone' Dodd's Studio One label, where she released a string of successful duets and solo tracks, including her breakout hit 'Feel Like Jumping.'[1][4][5]

Throughout the 1970s, Griffiths solidified her reputation both as a solo artist and as part of influential collaborations. She formed the duo Bob and Marcia with Bob Andy, achieving international acclaim with songs like 'Young, Gifted and Black.' From 1974 to 1981, she was a member of the I Threes, the legendary vocal trio that provided harmonies for Bob Marley & the Wailers, contributing to the global spread of reggae music. Griffiths continued to release solo hits, most notably 'Electric Boogie,' which sparked the worldwide dance phenomenon known as the Electric Slide.[1][3][4]

Griffiths' musical style blends rocksteady, lovers rock, roots reggae, and dancehall, characterized by her smooth, emotive vocals and uplifting messages. Her six-decade career has earned her numerous accolades, including the Order of Distinction (OD) and the Order of Jamaica (OJ), making her the only Jamaican female artist to receive this honor. Her enduring influence and commitment to uplifting audiences have cemented her legacy as one of reggae's most important and beloved voices.[4][5]
