## Biography
The Jeff Albert Quartet is led by Jeff Albert, a highly regarded trombonist, composer, and improviser whose career bridges the worlds of jazz tradition and experimental music. Born and raised in Lafayette, Louisiana, Albert began performing professionally while still in high school during the 1980s. He moved to New Orleans in 1988, immersing himself in the city's vibrant musical culture, and became a prominent figure in both its jazz and creative music scenes. Albert's academic journey includes degrees from Loyola University New Orleans and the University of New Orleans, where he studied under jazz luminaries such as Ellis Marsalis and Harold Battiste. He later became the first graduate of the PhD program in Experimental Music and Digital Media at Louisiana State University, reflecting his deep engagement with both acoustic and electronic music traditions.

Throughout his career, Albert has been recognized for his innovative approach to improvisation and ensemble leadership. His work with the Jeff Albert Quartet and other groups, such as the Instigation Quartet, is characterized by a blend of free jazz, structured improvisation, and collaborative exploration. He has released albums on respected labels like RogueArt and Clean Feed Records, and his 2020 album 'Unanimous Sources' was named a top 10 jazz record of the year by the Boston Globe. Albert's versatility extends to classical and popular music, having performed with the Louisiana Philharmonic Orchestra, New Orleans Opera, and accompanied artists ranging from Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga to Stevie Wonder and U2. In addition to his performance career, Albert is a dedicated educator and researcher, having served on the faculties of Loyola University New Orleans and, since 2023, Georgia Institute of Technology. His legacy is marked by his contributions to improvised music, his mentorship of emerging musicians, and his research in music technology and pedagogy.
