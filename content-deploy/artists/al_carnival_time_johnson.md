## Biography
Al 'Carnival Time' Johnson, born Alvin Lee Johnson on June 20, 1939, in New Orleans, Louisiana, is a celebrated singer, pianist, and songwriter whose name is synonymous with the city’s Mardi Gras festivities. Raised in the Ninth Ward, Johnson was surrounded by the vibrant sounds of New Orleans rhythm and blues, drawing early inspiration from local legends like Fats Domino, Sugar Boy Crawford, and Smiley Lewis. Encouraged by his father, who bought musical instruments for the family, Johnson gravitated toward the piano, seeking to emulate the distinctive New Orleans sound of his heroes.

Johnson’s career began in earnest as a teenager when he recorded his first single, 'Ole Time Talkin’,' for Aladdin Records at age 16. His breakthrough came in 1960 with the recording of 'Carnival Time' at Cosimo Matassa’s studio, produced by Joe Ruffino for Ric Records. The song quickly became a Mardi Gras anthem, joining the ranks of Professor Longhair’s 'Go to the Mardi Gras' and The Hawketts’ 'Mardi Gras Mambo.' Despite facing legal battles over the rights to his hit, Johnson ultimately secured full ownership in 1999, allowing him to manage his own career and maintain artistic independence. Over the decades, he has continued to write, record, and perform, earning induction into the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame in 2007 and remaining a beloved figure in New Orleans music culture.

Johnson’s musical style is rooted in New Orleans rhythm and blues, characterized by rollicking piano lines, infectious rhythms, and lyrics steeped in local tradition. His enduring legacy is cemented by the perennial popularity of 'Carnival Time,' which remains a staple of Mardi Gras celebrations and a testament to his influence on the city’s musical identity.
