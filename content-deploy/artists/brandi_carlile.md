## Biography
Brandi Carlile, born June 1, 1981 in Ravensdale, Washington, is an acclaimed American singer-songwriter and producer whose music spans folk rock, Americana, alternative country, and classic rock[1][2]. Raised in a musical family—her mother was a local country singer—Carlile taught herself to sing and began performing country songs on stage at age eight, later learning guitar and piano as a teenager[2][4][8]. She dropped out of Tahoma High School to pursue music full-time, starting as a backup singer for an Elvis impersonator before busking and performing in Seattle clubs[2][4][7].

Carlile's career took off after signing with Columbia Records in 2004, releasing her self-titled debut album in 2005 to critical acclaim and earning a spot on Rolling Stone's '10 Artists to Watch in 2005'[1][4]. Her breakthrough came with the 2007 album 'The Story,' produced by T Bone Burnett, which showcased her powerful vocals and emotive songwriting[1][4]. Carlile's band, featuring twin brothers Phil and Tim Hanseroth, has remained her core collaborators since her earliest recordings[1][4]. Over the years, she has released several acclaimed albums, including 'Give Up the Ghost' (2009), 'Bear Creek' (2012), 'The Firewatcher's Daughter' (2015), 'By the Way, I Forgive You' (2018), and 'In These Silent Days' (2021)[1][4]. Her work has earned her eleven Grammy Awards, two Emmy Awards, and an Academy Award nomination[1][2].

Carlile is celebrated for her honest, genre-blending musical style, drawing on influences from classic rock, folk, and country[1][3][6]. She is also known for her activism, founding the Looking Out Foundation to support humanitarian and social justice causes[5]. In 2019, she formed the supergroup The Highwomen with Amanda Shires, Maren Morris, and Natalie Hemby, further cementing her legacy as a champion of women in music[1].
