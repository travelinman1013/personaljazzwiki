## Biography
Queen Latifah, born Dana Elaine Owens on March 18, 1970, in Newark, New Jersey, is widely recognized as one of the pioneering women in hip hop and a multifaceted entertainer. Raised in a family with strong community ties—her mother was a schoolteacher and her father a police officer—Latifah grew up immersed in both the Baptist church and the vibrant urban culture of New Jersey. Her stage name, meaning 'delicate and sensitive' in Arabic, was given to her by a cousin when she was eight years old. She began singing in her church choir and performed in school musicals, notably singing 'Home' from The Wiz in a high school play[4][7].

Latifah's musical career took off in her teens when she joined the rap group Ladies Fresh and became a founding member of the Flavor Unit, an influential collective of Jersey MCs led by producer DJ Mark the 45 King. Her debut single, 'Wrath of My Madness,' was released in 1988, and her first album, 'All Hail the Queen' (1989), garnered critical acclaim for its fusion of jazz, reggae, and soul influences with socially conscious lyrics addressing sexism, racism, and domestic abuse[3][4][5][7]. Latifah's 1993 single 'U.N.I.T.Y.' won her a Grammy Award and cemented her reputation as a powerful voice for women in hip hop[4].

Beyond music, Queen Latifah has built a distinguished career in film and television, earning an Oscar nomination for her role in 'Chicago' (2002) and an Emmy nod for portraying blues legend Bessie Smith in 'Bessie' (2015)[4]. She is also a successful producer and entrepreneur, co-founding the Flavor Unit management company. Latifah's legacy is defined by her trailblazing contributions to hip hop, her advocacy for social justice, and her role as a mentor and inspiration to generations of artists.
