## Biography
Jonwayne, born Jonathan Wayne on June 5, 1990, in La Habra, California, is an American rapper and producer recognized for his innovative approach to jazz rap and hip hop. A descendant of Revolutionary War General 'Mad' Anthony Wayne, Jonwayne's early life was marked by a brief stint in stage acting and a growing passion for poetry, which ultimately led him to hip hop at age 17. His immersion in the Los Angeles music scene began at the influential Low End Theory club, where he became one of the youngest performers and connected with key figures in the burgeoning beatmaker movement.

Initially gaining attention as an instrumental producer, Jonwayne released his debut album 'Bowser' in 2011, followed by a series of mixtapes that showcased both his production and lyrical prowess. His unique style, blending introspective lyricism with experimental beats, caught the attention of Stones Throw Records founder Peanut Butter Wolf, leading to a record deal and the release of acclaimed projects such as 'Rap Album One' (2013) and 'Rap Album Two' (2017). Jonwayne's work is characterized by fearless jazz influences, intricate rhyme schemes, and a willingness to push hip hop's boundaries, earning him respect as a leading voice in the new generation of underground rap.
