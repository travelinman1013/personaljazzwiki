## Biography
Rudy Royston is a jazz drummer, percussionist, composer, and educator born in Fort Worth, Texas, and raised in Denver, Colorado.[1][2] He began playing drums and percussion as a toddler, often performing in church and surrounded by an eclectic collection of percussion instruments that his father, who worked as a supervisor of shipping at a children's percussion instrument company, would bring home.[2][3] His musical education began formally in the fourth grade, supported by his mother's commitment to the arts, and he continued studying percussion, viola, and tenor saxophone through high school. A pivotal moment came when Royston attended the Telluride Jazz Camp on scholarship as a sophomore in high school, where he studied jazz drum set with Duffy Jackson and Ed Soph—an experience that inspired him to pursue music professionally for the rest of his life.[2][3]

Royston's formal training included studies at the University of Northern Colorado, Metropolitan State College of Denver, and the University of Denver, where he graduated with honors earning Bachelor of Arts degrees in Music and Poetry.[2][3] While in college, he began his long-standing relationship with Denver trumpeter Ron Miles, whom he considers his greatest teacher and music mentor, collaborating with Miles since the early 1990s.[1][2] After teaching music in public schools for 10 years, Royston relocated to the East Coast in 2006 to pursue graduate studies at Rutgers University's Mason Gross School of the Arts, where he studied with jazz drummer Victor Lewis.[2][3] He quickly integrated into New York's creative music scene and has since become recognized as a first-tier talent in contemporary jazz, performing and recording with world-renowned artists including Dave Douglas, Bill Frisell, JD Allen, Jason Moran, Les McCann, Ben Allison, and the Mingus Big Band, among many others.[2][3]

As a bandleader and composer, Royston has released multiple albums on the Greenleaf Music label, beginning with *303* in 2014, followed by *Rise of Orion* (2016), *Flatbed Buggy* (featuring a chamber-like quintet with accordion, woodwinds, cello, bass, and drums), *PaNOptic* (2020, a solo drumming album supporting MusiCares COVID-19 Relief Fund), and *DAY* (2023).[3] His drumming has appeared on over 50 jazz releases, and he is noted for his dynamic yet delicate technique, empathy with fellow musicians, and engaging original compositions that often evoke cinematic and sepia-toned atmospheres.[4][6] Royston continues to work as a professional educator, drummer, and percussionist, based in New Jersey.

## Fun Facts
- Royston's father worked as a supervisor of shipping at a children's percussion instrument company and would bring home slightly damaged percussion instruments, surrounding young Rudy with bongos, rhythm sticks, xylophones, recorders, metallophones, glockenspiels, and drums—creating an instrument-rich childhood environment.[2]
- His first album as a leader, *303*, takes its title from Denver's area code (303), referencing his hometown and emergence from the Denver jazz scene nearly a decade before its 2014 release.[4]
- The *303* album features dramatic interpretations of classical and contemporary music, including Mozart's 'Ave Verum Corpus' and Radiohead's 'High and Dry,' showcasing Royston's versatility beyond traditional jazz.[3]
- Royston released *PaNOptic*, a solo drumming album, in 2020 specifically to support the MusiCares COVID-19 Relief Fund, demonstrating his commitment to using his music for charitable causes.[3]
