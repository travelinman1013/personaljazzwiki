## Biography
Erica Falls is a celebrated soul singer and songwriter from New Orleans, Louisiana, who emerged from the culturally rich 9th Ward as the youngest of eight children. Growing up in a musical household, Falls was immersed in a diverse array of sounds from an early age, with her mother—a schoolteacher and church musician who sang and played piano and organ—serving as a foundational influence. Her parents exposed her to legendary artists including Roberta Flack, Aretha Franklin, Stevie Wonder, Nina Simone, Luther Vandross, Anita Baker, Sarah Vaughan, and Whitney Houston, creating a rich musical foundation that would shape her distinctive vintage soul sound. Falls discovered her vocal talents while singing at church with her family, and by the end of high school, she had begun performing in bands around New Orleans, quickly gaining recognition for her powerful voice.

Falls' professional career took off in the 1990s when she began performing covers on Bourbon Street with Nu Beginnings, which led to extensive work as a backing vocalist and session singer for music industry luminaries including Allen Toussaint (who became a significant mentor), Dr. John, Sting, No Doubt, Jennifer Hudson, John Fogerty, and Joe Sample. Between 2014 and 2019, she served as the lead vocalist for the renowned New Orleans funk band Galactic, touring extensively across the country before departing to focus on her solo career. As a solo artist, Falls released her debut album "Me, Myself & Music" in 2011, followed by "Homegrown" in 2017, which earned critical acclaim and multiple nominations at OffBeat Magazine's 2017 Best of The Beat Awards, winning Best Female Vocalist. Her latest album "Emotions," released in March 2024 and co-produced by Nick Mercadel, is a deeply personal reflection on her pandemic experiences, featuring collaborations with George Porter Jr. and Jamison Ross.

Falls has established herself as a rising star in contemporary R&B and soul with her signature "vintage soul" sound—a style she describes as a reminder that authentic soul music is timeless rather than nostalgic. Her electrifying live performances, characterized by a dynamic mix of fashion, sassiness, and groove, have made her a fixture at prestigious venues and festivals including the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival and Essence Fest. Beyond music, Falls ventured into film in 2013 when director Lee Daniels hand-picked her to appear as a singer in his critically acclaimed film "The Butler." Known for extracting eloquent sounds from within the soul and delivering them straight to the heart of audiences, Falls views herself as a messenger of music's universal healing power, continuing to captivate audiences with her powerful vocals and heartfelt performances that blend neo-soul with vintage influences.
