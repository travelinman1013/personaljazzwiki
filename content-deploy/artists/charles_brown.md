## Biography
Charles Brown, born Tony Russell Brown on September 13, 1922, in Texas City, Texas, was orphaned early after his mother's death and his father's itinerant life as a cotton picker. Classically trained on piano from age ten, he was profoundly influenced by jazz pianist Art Tatum's blend of classical techniques with blues and jazz. After earning a chemistry degree, working as a chemist and teacher, Brown moved to Los Angeles in 1943-1944, winning an amateur night contest that led to his musical career.[1][2][3][4]

Brown joined Johnny Moore's Three Blazers in 1944, a piano-guitar-bass trio epitomizing the cool, relaxed West Coast blues style with a melancholy edge, modeled after Nat King Cole's trio but bluesier. As pianist and vocalist, he co-wrote and recorded hits like 'Driftin' Blues' (1946, topped R&B charts), 'Sunny Road,' 'So Long,' and the holiday classic 'Merry Christmas Baby' (1947) for Aladdin Records, making the group R&B stars through 1948. Going solo in 1948, Brown scored nine R&B Top 10 hits by 1952, including 'Trouble Blues' (No. 1 for 15 weeks), 'Black Night,' 'Hard Times,' and 'Please Come Home for Christmas,' pioneering urbane, piano-driven West Coast blues.[1][2][3][4][5]

Brown's career waned in the rock era but revived in the 1980s via blues festivals, a Rhythm and Blues Foundation grant, and tours opening for Bonnie Raitt in 1990, yielding acclaimed albums like 'One More for the Road' (1986) and 'All My Life' (1990 Grammy winner). He earned Blues Hall of Fame inductions (1997, 1991 instrumentalist, 1993/1995 vocalist) and posthumous Rock and Roll Hall of Fame entry (1999), dying January 21, 1999, at age 76, leaving a legacy as an influential blues singer-pianist.[1][2][3][4][5]
