## Biography
The Falcon Trio was an early Cajun music ensemble featuring accordionist Joe Falcon, guitarist and vocalist Cléoma Breaux (née Falcon, formerly Breaux), and occasionally vocalist Leon Meche, active in the late 1920s in southwest Louisiana. They gained prominence by recording one of the first commercial Cajun records, 'Allons à Lafayette' (also known as 'Lafayette'), on April 27, 1928, in New Orleans for Columbia Records, after promoter George Burrow (or Burrs) convinced skeptical executives by guaranteeing purchases.[1][2][3] Cléoma, born May 27, 1906, and Joe, born September 28, 1900, both from the Rayne area, had been performing together on the dance-hall circuit, blending accordion-driven waltzes and two-steps in French, challenging norms as one of the few female-fronted acts.[1][2]

Their 1928 recording sparked a Cajun music boom, selling thousands and headlining venues across Louisiana and Texas, though Meche backed out of the session due to nerves, leaving Joe and Cléoma as the core duo.[1][3] They married in 1931, recorded additional sides in New York (1928-1929) and Atlanta, including classics like 'The Old Drunkard and His Wife,' then paused during the Great Depression before resuming with Decca in 1934, experimenting with blues and country influences.[1][2][3] By 1936, as the Falcon Trio, they recorded tracks like 'Pauvre Garcon' for RCA, maintaining popularity on the fais-do-do circuit.[5]

Cléoma died on April 7 or 9, 1941, at age 34 from an unspecified illness in Crowley, Louisiana; Joe continued with his Silver Bell String Band until his death in 1965, but the trio's pioneering role established commercial Cajun music.[1][2][3]

## Fun Facts
- Record executives initially rejected the trio, accustomed to big orchestras, but promoter George Burrow guaranteed 500 records to secure the session for 'Allons à Lafayette'.[1][2][3]
- Cléoma was one of the few women performing publicly in Cajun music, retaining a feminine appearance in often violent dance halls, boosting their draw despite not being credited on early records.[1][2]
- The 1928 hit sold 50,000-60,000 copies in a small regional market, turning local Cajun waltzes into a commercial phenomenon.[2]
- A 1929 session included Cléoma with her brothers Amédée and Ophie Breaux recording 'Jolie Blonde' (as 'Ma Blonde Est Partie'), the Cajun national anthem.[2]
