## Biography
Video Age is a New Orleans-based band formed by core duo Ross Farbe (lead singer/guitarist) and Ray Micarelli (drummer), who had been making music in the city for years prior to officially starting the project in 2016 with their debut album *Living Alone*. The band expanded to a four-piece with touring and recording members Nick Corson (bass) and Duncan Troast (keys), embracing a musical style heavily inspired by 1980s yacht rock, synth-pop, and soft rock, characterized by sweet harmonies, vintage drum machines, '80s-tinged synths, and an endearing cheesiness reminiscent of artists like Michael McDonald, Toto, and Janet Jackson. Their early recordings experimented with affordable vintage '80s equipment in home studios, evolving from bedroom production to more collaborative live jamming sessions, as seen in the creation of their 2020 album *Pleasure Line* and 2023's *Away From The Castle*.[1][2][3][4][5]
