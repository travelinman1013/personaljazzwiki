## Biography
Mass Production is a pioneering American funk and post-disco band formed in Norfolk, Virginia in the early 1970s. The group’s origins trace back to childhood friends Ricardo Williams, Tyrone Williams, and LeCoy Bryant, who began performing together as The Soulnifics while still in junior high school. Their early years were shaped by the soul and R&B sounds of the era, drawing inspiration from groups like The Delfonics and The O'Jays. After evolving through several lineups and names, they became Mass Production in the mid-1970s, solidifying their core membership with the addition of instrumentalists and vocalists from their local scene and college connections, including Agnes “Tiny” Kelly, who joined while attending Norfolk State College.

The band’s breakthrough came after winning a battle-of-the-bands contest in Norfolk, which led to a contract with Pepper Productions and, subsequently, a deal with Cotillion Records in New York. Between 1976 and 1983, Mass Production released eight albums, starting with 'Welcome To Our World' (1976) and including notable works like 'Believe' (1977), 'Three Miles High' (1978), and 'In the Purest Form' (1979). Their biggest hit, 'Firecracker,' became a club anthem and showcased their signature blend of tight funk grooves, jazz-influenced horn arrangements, and energetic rhythms. The band enjoyed creative autonomy, with songwriting handled collectively and a democratic approach to selecting material for their albums.

Musically, Mass Production is recognized for their innovative fusion of funk, disco, and jazz, contributing to the post-disco movement of the late 1970s and early 1980s. Their tracks, such as 'Cosmic Lust,' 'Shante,' and 'Turn Up the Music,' remain staples in dance and funk circles. The group’s legacy is further cemented by their influence on later artists, particularly through the frequent sampling of their work in hip-hop and R&B. Mass Production continues to perform with several original members, maintaining their reputation as enduring architects of the funk and post-disco sound.

## Fun Facts
- The band's biggest hit, 'Firecracker,' was inspired by Ricardo Williams' real-life crush on a neighborhood girl who later became his wife.
- 'Firecracker' has been sampled in major hip-hop hits, including 2 Live Crew's 'Me So Horny' and Megan Thee Stallion's 'Kitty Kat.'
- Mass Production won a battle-of-the-bands contest in Norfolk, which directly led to their first record contract and move to New York.
- Six original members of Mass Production are still performing together, and the group continues to tour and record new music decades after their debut.
