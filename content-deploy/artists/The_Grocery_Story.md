## Biography
The Grocery Story is an Americana ensemble rooted in the vibrant musical traditions of New Orleans and Colorado, formed by John Magnie and Steve Amedee—both founding members of the acclaimed roots-rock band The Subdudes. John Magnie, originally from Denver, moved to New Orleans in 1974, where he met Amedee and the other Subdudes, before the group relocated to Fort Collins, Colorado in 1987. Steve Amedee, hailing from small-town Louisiana, brought his son Jess Amedee into the fold, who began playing drums at age three and now performs alongside his father on a custom double drum set.

The band’s lineup is a testament to the rich musical tapestry of their adopted home in Fort Collins, featuring local stalwarts such as bassist Marty Rein, guitarist and songwriter Mike Finders (known for his work with FY5 and SpiderCat), and a trio of dynamic lead vocalists: Peaches Embry (with roots in Gary, Indiana and New Orleans), Rhonda Merrick (from a renowned New Orleans musical family), and Erik Lunde (a Wisconsin native and respected Fort Collins singer-songwriter). Their debut album, 'Situation on Aisle #3,' showcases original compositions by Magnie, Embry, and Merrick, alongside soulful renditions of classics by Johnny Cash and Pops Staples.

Musically, The Grocery Story blends blues, rock, gospel, zydeco, and R&B, creating a sound described as a 'rich New Orleans gumbo.' Their performances are characterized by powerful vocal harmonies, passionate songwriting, and a rhythmic groove anchored by the father-son drum duo. The band’s innovative approach—featuring three lead vocalists and a blend of original and classic material—cements their legacy as a heartfelt, genre-defying force in the contemporary Americana scene.

## Fun Facts
- The band features a rare double drum set played by father-son duo Steve and Jess Amedee, creating a unique rhythmic foundation.
