## Biography
James Jordan (born 1953) is an American conductor, writer, and professor recognized as one of the United States' leading innovators in choral music. He earned a Bachelor of Music from Susquehanna University, where he initially pursued pre-med before changing his major to music after being initially rejected by the Music Education Department—a rejection that impressed faculty with his determination. He continued his education at Temple University, earning both a Master of Music in choral conducting and a Doctor of Philosophy in the psychology of music. Jordan's introduction to choral music came unexpectedly when he attended a Luther College Choir concert as a college student, an experience that inspired his lifelong dedication to the field despite never singing in high school.

Throughout his career, Jordan has established himself as a prolific author and innovative educator. Since publishing his foundational book *The Musician's Soul* in 1999, he has written over 60 books published under the GIA Publications label, with *Evoking Sound: Fundamentals of Choral Conducting and Rehearsing* recognized as a "must read" by *The Choral Journal*. At Westminster Choir College in Lawrenceville, New Jersey, he serves as Senior Conductor and directs the Williamson Voices recording ensemble. His scholarly contributions include pioneering work in applying Laban Movement Analysis to conducting pedagogy and advocating case study methodology in music education research. Jordan has conducted more than 30 All-State Choirs and served on the choral panel for The National Endowment for the Arts in 2009.

Jordan's artistic achievements have garnered international recognition and numerous honors. In 2013, his recording of James Whitbourn's *Annelies* with the Williamson Voices received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Choral Performance. He was awarded a Doctor of Music degree by the University of Aberdeen in Scotland in 2014 and received the Iorio Research Prize from Rider University in 2012. His influence extends globally through residencies, master classes, and guest conducting throughout the United States, Canada, Europe, and Australia. Currently, he co-directs the Choral Institute at Oxford with composer James Whitbourn and is working to revise music education curricula in Chinese public schools, while focusing his research on choral improvisation.
