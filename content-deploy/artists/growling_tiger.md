## Biography
Neville Marcano, known professionally as Growling Tiger, was born in Siparia, Trinidad, in either 1915 or 1916 (sources differ slightly)[2][4][6]. Before his musical career, Marcano was a successful boxer, earning the nickname 'Siparia Tiger' after winning the Trinidad boxing championship in 1929[2][6]. Transitioning from sports to music, he became deeply involved in Trinidad's calypso scene, drawing on his early experiences with outlawed stick fighting (kalinda) and bongo, a drum dance performed at wakes[3].

Growling Tiger quickly established himself as a leading calypsonian, known for his powerful voice and socially conscious lyrics. He was crowned the first Calypso King of Trinidad and Tobago, a testament to his influence and popularity[5]. His songs often addressed political and social issues, setting him apart from many of his contemporaries. In 1962, Alan Lomax recorded Growling Tiger in Trinidad, helping to preserve his music for future generations[1].

Tiger's legacy is profound: he is credited with shaping the direction of calypso, inspiring both his peers and subsequent generations of musicians. His contributions to Trinidadian culture and music have been documented in biographies and recordings, ensuring his place as one of the genre's foundational figures[5][7].
