## Biography
Bill Harris (April 14, 1925 – December 6, 1988) was an American guitarist best known for his work in rhythm and blues and jazz, particularly through his long association with the R&B vocal group The Clovers and a series of distinctive solo jazz guitar recordings.[2][1] Born in Nashville, North Carolina, he first made music on the organ in his family church before turning seriously to guitar after World War II service, studying at the Columbia School of Music in Washington, D.C.[2][1][8] By 1950 he joined The Clovers, becoming a key part of their sound on many of their most successful recordings through 1958 while simultaneously developing a parallel identity as an innovative jazz guitarist.[2][1][3]

During the mid‑1950s Harris began recording under his own name, including the EmArcy albums *Bill Harris* (often cited as *Solo Guitar*) in 1956 and *The Harris Touch* in 1957, followed by *Great Guitar Sounds* (1963), *Caught in the Act* (1966), and several sessions for the French label Black & Blue in the early 1970s.[2][3] His 1956 EmArcy release has been described as the first album of solo jazz guitar ever issued, highlighting his refined touch, chordal sophistication, and ability to blend blues feeling with modern jazz harmony.[3] Harris remained based largely in the Washington, D.C. area through the 1960s and 1970s, performing widely, teaching guitar, and publishing several instructional books on technique, which helped disseminate his approach to the instrument.[2][1][3]

In 1972 Harris received a compositional fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts, spending much of 1972–73 performing and recording in France, where he cut albums such as *Down in the Alley* and *Rhythm* for Black & Blue.[2][3] On returning to the United States he broadened his role in the scene, operating a restaurant and art gallery and later managing the Washington, D.C. jazz club Pigfoot, while also acting as an impresario who organized and presented concerts across multiple genres.[3][2][8] Financial difficulties, including an IRS seizure of Pigfoot in 1981 and later loss of his home, overshadowed his final years, but friends and colleagues rallied around him with benefit concerts as his health declined.[3][8] Harris’s legacy rests on his pioneering solo jazz guitar work, his contribution to classic R&B recordings with The Clovers, and his influence as a teacher and community organizer in D.C.’s jazz life.[2][1][3]

## Fun Facts
- Harris’s 1956 EmArcy album *Bill Harris* (often referred to as *Solo Guitar*) has been described as the first full‑length album of solo jazz guitar ever released, predating the better‑known solo records of several later guitarists.[3]
- Before focusing on guitar, Harris played organ in his family church in rural Nashville, North Carolina, a grounding in gospel and church music that later colored his bluesy jazz phrasing.[8][3]
- While working as a guitarist for The Clovers, Harris was discovered as a solo artist when fellow guitarist Mickey Baker overheard him practicing backstage and used his industry connections to help launch Harris’s recording career under his own name.[3]
- In addition to performing and teaching, Harris ran his own Washington, D.C. jazz club called Pigfoot; although the IRS eventually repossessed the club for back taxes in 1981, it was remembered locally as a vibrant hub for live jazz.[2][3][8]
