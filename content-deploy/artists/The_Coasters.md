## Biography
The Coasters are a pioneering American vocal group formed in 1955, originally from Los Angeles, California. The group emerged from the earlier R&B outfit the Robins, with key members Carl Gardner and Bobby Nunn leaving to create a new lineup under the guidance of songwriting and producing duo Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller. Relocating to New York, they recruited Leon Hughes and Billy Guy, establishing a quartet that would become known for its witty, narrative-driven songs and comedic vocal interplay. Their early hits, including 'Down in Mexico,' 'Searchin',' and 'Young Blood,' quickly propelled them to national fame, with their music characterized by clever lyrics, strong rhythm and blues foundations, and a playful, theatrical style that set them apart from other doo-wop and rock and roll acts of the era.

The Coasters' collaboration with Leiber and Stoller was central to their success, producing a string of classic hits such as 'Yakety Yak,' 'Charlie Brown,' and 'Poison Ivy.' These songs, often directed at teenage audiences, featured alternating lead vocals, humorous bass lines, and prominent saxophone solos, notably by King Curtis. The group's innovative approach helped bridge R&B with mainstream rock and roll, making them one of the first black vocal groups to achieve crossover success. Their influence extended well beyond their initial heyday, with numerous personnel changes allowing them to continue performing into the 1990s and beyond. The Coasters' enduring legacy was cemented by their induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987, recognizing their significant impact on American popular music.
