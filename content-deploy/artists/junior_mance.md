## Biography
Junior Mance, born Julian Clifford Mance, Jr. on October 10, 1928 in Evanston, Illinois, was a celebrated American jazz pianist and composer whose career spanned nearly seven decades. He began playing piano at age five, learning stride and boogie-woogie from his father, and was performing professionally by age ten. After briefly studying music at Roosevelt College in Chicago, Mance left academia to join Gene Ammons' band in 1947, marking the start of a prolific career as both a leader and sideman.

Mance's early years saw collaborations with jazz luminaries such as Lester Young, Dinah Washington, and Cannonball Adderley, the latter helping him secure a position in the 36th Army Band during his military service. After his Army discharge, Mance became a fixture at Chicago’s Bee Hive Jazz Club, accompanying legends like Charlie Parker and Coleman Hawkins. His debut as a leader came in 1959 with the album 'Junior' on Verve, followed by a string of influential recordings for Jazzland/Riverside, Capitol, and Atlantic. Known for his soulful, blues-infused touch and swinging hard bop style, Mance was also a dedicated educator, mentoring young musicians at The New School in New York. He continued performing into his late 80s, often with groups featuring his students, and left a legacy as both a masterful pianist and a generous teacher.

Mance passed away in New York City on January 17, 2021, at the age of 92, remembered for his impeccable musicianship and his deep contributions to jazz and soul jazz.
