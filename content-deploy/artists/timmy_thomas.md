## Biography
Timmy Thomas (born November 13, 1944, Evansville, Indiana – died March 11, 2022) was an American singer, songwriter, keyboardist, and producer best known for his socially conscious soul music, particularly the 1972 hit 'Why Can't We Live Together.' Raised as one of twelve children, Thomas began his musical journey as a session musician in Memphis, working alongside jazz legends like Donald Byrd and Cannonball Adderley before releasing early singles on Goldwax Records.[1][2][3][4]

Thomas's career transformed after moving to Miami in the early 1970s, where he signed with Glades Records. His breakthrough came with 'Why Can't We Live Together,' an anti-war anthem inspired by the Vietnam War and notable for its pioneering use of a drum machine. The song topped the Billboard R&B chart, reached the top three on the Hot 100, and sold over two million copies worldwide, becoming a defining moment of the Miami soul sound.[1][2][3][4]

Throughout the 1970s and beyond, Thomas continued to release music that blended classic soul with socially aware themes, collaborating with artists like Betty Wright and later working as a producer for LaFace Records. His influence endured into the 21st century, with his work sampled by contemporary artists such as Drake and covered by Sade, cementing his legacy as a soulful innovator whose music resonated across generations.[2][3][4]
