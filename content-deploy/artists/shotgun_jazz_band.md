## Biography
The Shotgun Jazz Band is a distinguished traditional jazz ensemble founded in New Orleans in April 2011, spearheaded by trumpeter and vocalist Marla Dixon and her husband, banjoist John Dixon[1][2][4]. The band originated from the couple’s move from Toronto to New Orleans, where they began as street performers in the French Market, gradually attracting like-minded musicians and evolving into a full-fledged group[2][3][8]. Their name pays homage to the classic New Orleans shotgun house where the Dixons lived and rehearsed, reflecting their deep connection to the city’s musical heritage[2][3].

From its humble beginnings as a street band, Shotgun Jazz Band quickly transitioned to performing in renowned local clubs and festivals, including the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, French Quarter Festival, and Satchmo Summer Fest[1][6]. Their sound is characterized by a passionate revival of early New Orleans jazz, with an emphasis on ensemble playing and a repertoire that draws heavily from swing and ragtime traditions[5][10]. Marla Dixon’s powerful, brassy vocals and the multinational lineup—including musicians from Wales, Toronto, Alabama, Missouri, and New York—have helped the band cultivate a distinctive energy and authenticity[2].

Over the years, Shotgun Jazz Band has released six albums, such as 'Algiers Strut', 'One Drink Minimum', and 'Yearning', each showcasing their commitment to high-quality, historically rooted jazz[3]. The band is recognized as a driving force in the contemporary New Orleans jazz renaissance, regularly collaborating with veteran musicians and inspiring both audiences and fellow artists with their dedication to the spirit of the city’s musical legacy[1][6].
