## Biography
Swinging in New Orleans is a contemporary traditional‑jazz project based in New Orleans that presents classic Crescent City repertoire in a live, club‑oriented setting. The name appears primarily as a band/brand title rather than as a single individual artist, centered on regular performances at venues such as the Royal Frenchmen Hotel & Bar, where the group is billed simply as “Swinging in New Orleans.”[8] In promotional materials and on its own website and YouTube channel, the project is framed as an immersive way to experience the sounds of New Orleans jazz, with an emphasis on honoring songs from earlier generations and connecting audiences to the city’s musical heritage.[3][6]

Online content associated with Swinging in New Orleans highlights its role as both an entertainment act and an educational or cultural bridge: its blog and descriptions discuss the history and cultural significance of New Orleans musical traditions, such as Mardi Gras music, within the broader context of local culture.[5][3] The group’s performances are described as an “enchanting musical journey” through New Orleans jazz, suggesting a repertoire that leans toward vintage swing and early jazz styles rather than modern fusion or experimental forms.[8][6] Because the available sources present Swinging in New Orleans as a current performing outfit and content brand, rather than documenting a long historical arc, there is no verifiable information about a specific founding date, fixed membership lineup, or long‑term legacy beyond its present role in keeping traditional New Orleans jazz in front of live audiences and online viewers.[3][5][6]

Given the limited public documentation, details such as individual members’ early lives, formal career development, and long‑range influence on later artists are not available in reliable sources. What is clear from its digital footprint is that Swinging in New Orleans situates itself firmly within the classic New Orleans jazz tradition—emphasizing ensemble swing, danceable rhythms, and historically rooted repertoire—and uses modern platforms like YouTube and a dedicated website to reach both local audiences and listeners abroad.[3][6][8]
