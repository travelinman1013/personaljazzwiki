## Biography
Willie Geary 'Bunk' Johnson (born December 27, 1889, in New Orleans, Louisiana, U.S.—died July 7, 1949, in New Iberia, Louisiana) was a pioneering American jazz trumpeter and a central figure in the 1940s traditional jazz revival[1][5]. Johnson grew up in New Orleans, where he received early music lessons and sang in church before taking up the cornet and later the trumpet[3]. He claimed to have played with the legendary Buddy Bolden in the 1890s and to have taught a young Louis Armstrong, though most scholars believe he was born too late to have played with Bolden and that his relationship with Armstrong was more inspirational than instructional[1][2]. Johnson performed with Frankie Dusen’s Eagle Band (successor to Bolden’s group) and other New Orleans ensembles before leaving the city around 1914 to tour with jazz, dance, vaudeville, and circus bands[1].

After dental problems forced him into retirement in the 1930s, Johnson was rediscovered in 1939 by jazz scholars Frederick Ramsey and William Russell, thanks in part to Louis Armstrong’s endorsement[1][3]. With a new trumpet and dentures, he made a dramatic comeback, recording extensively in the early and mid-1940s and leading bands of veteran New Orleans musicians[1][3]. His recordings and performances during this period, often with clarinetist George Lewis and trombonist Jim Robinson, became touchstones of the traditional jazz revival[3]. Johnson’s style was rooted in early New Orleans jazz—lyrical, expressive, and marked by a strong melodic lead—though his later years were also marked by personal struggles, including alcoholism and a volatile temperament[3][4]. Despite these challenges, his legacy endures as a vital link to jazz’s earliest days and a catalyst for its mid-century revival[1][3].

## Fun Facts
- Bunk Johnson’s comeback was enabled by a public fundraising campaign to buy him a new trumpet and dentures after years of obscurity and dental problems[3].
- He was featured prominently in the influential 1939 book 'Jazzmen,' which helped spark the traditional jazz revival[3].
- Johnson’s appearance in New York during the birth of bebop caused a 'jazz war' between traditionalists and modernists in the press[3].
- Despite his claims, most scholars believe Johnson was born in 1889, not 1879 as he often stated, making some of his stories about early jazz history likely exaggerated[1][4].
