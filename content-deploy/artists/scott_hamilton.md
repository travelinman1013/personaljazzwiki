## Biography
Scott Hamilton, born on September 12, 1954 in Providence, Rhode Island, is a renowned American jazz tenor saxophonist celebrated for his dedication to swing and mainstream jazz traditions. Growing up, Hamilton was exposed to jazz from an early age, initially playing blues harp and alto sax before committing to the tenor saxophone by age sixteen. He began his professional journey in local blues and jazz bands, notably with The Hamilton-Bates Blue Flames, before moving to New York City in 1976 at the age of 22—a pivotal step that launched his international career[2][4].

At a time when jazz fusion dominated the scene, Hamilton stood out by embracing the classic swing style of saxophone legends like Ben Webster and Coleman Hawkins. His debut album as a leader, 'Scott Hamilton Is a Good Wind Who Is Blowing Us No Ill' (1977), marked the beginning of a prolific recording career, primarily with Concord Records, where he would release over 40 albums as leader or co-leader. Hamilton's warm tone, fluid phrasing, and lyrical improvisation earned him acclaim as a torchbearer for traditional jazz, and he became a fixture at clubs and festivals worldwide. Throughout the 1980s and beyond, he led his own groups, collaborated with jazz greats, and helped rekindle interest in acoustic jazz before the rise of the Young Lions movement[1][3][4].

Hamilton's musical style is characterized by a deep reverence for swing-era repertoire, a big, rounded tenor sound, and an effortless sense of swing. Over the decades, he has remained committed to this aesthetic, influencing a new generation of jazz musicians and maintaining a loyal international following. His legacy is cemented by his extensive discography, collaborations with icons such as Benny Goodman, Gerry Mulligan, and Rosemary Clooney, and his role in keeping classic jazz traditions alive into the 21st century[1][3][4].

## Fun Facts
- Scott Hamilton had only a few clarinet lessons as a child and is largely self-taught on saxophone[3].
- His debut album title, 'Scott Hamilton Is a Good Wind Who Is Blowing Us No Ill,' was inspired by jazz critic Leonard Feather paraphrasing a Billie Holiday lyric[1].
- Hamilton never attended music school, choosing instead to learn directly from older jazz musicians and through live performance experience[1][3].
- He overcame an early-career struggle with alcohol, achieving sobriety in the early 1980s and crediting this with helping him develop his own voice on the saxophone[2].
