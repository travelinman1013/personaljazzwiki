## Biography
La Lupe, born Guadalupe Victoria Yolí Raymond on December 23, 1936, in San Pedrito, Santiago de Cuba, emerged from humble beginnings to become one of the most electrifying and controversial voices in Latin music. Initially a schoolteacher at her father's insistence, she was drawn to music from an early age and won a radio singing contest as a teenager, performing a bolero by Olga Guillot. Her early career flourished in Havana's vibrant nightclub scene, where her passionate, energetic performances at venues like La Red quickly garnered a devoted following among artists, intellectuals, and the avant-garde. Her first album, 'Con el diablo en el cuerpo,' was released in 1960, and she became a national celebrity in Cuba, though her style was considered provocative and anti-revolutionary by the post-revolution government.[2][3][1]

Exiled from Cuba in 1962, La Lupe briefly tried to relaunch her career in Mexico before settling in New York City. There, she found new opportunities and musical connections, notably collaborating with Afro-Cuban percussionist Mongo Santamaría on the album 'Mongo Introduces La Lupe' (1963), which introduced her to American jazz audiences. Her partnership with legendary bandleader Tito Puente produced several successful albums and cemented her status as a leading diva of salsa and Latin soul, rivaled only by Celia Cruz. La Lupe's repertoire spanned bolero, guaracha, Latin jazz, salsa, mambo, son cubano, and cha cha cha, marked by her dramatic vocal delivery and theatrical stage presence. She was celebrated for her emotional intensity, often described as "violent" and "out of control," and became a fixture in the Latin music circuit throughout the Americas and Spain during the 1960s and early 1970s.[2][3][4][1]

Despite her fame, La Lupe's career declined in the late 1970s, partly due to changing musical trends and the rise of salsa icons like Celia Cruz. She retired in the 1980s, citing religious reasons, and lived in relative obscurity until her death on February 29, 1992. Her legacy endures as a pioneering figure in Latin music, remembered for her fearless artistry, boundary-pushing performances, and lasting influence on generations of musicians.[2][3][1]

## Fun Facts
- La Lupe was known for her wild stage antics, sometimes tearing her clothes off during performances, which led to her being banned from Puerto Rican television after a notorious awards show incident.[1]
- Her devoted fanbase in Havana included literary and artistic luminaries such as Ernest Hemingway, Tennessee Williams, Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, and Marlon Brando.[2]
- Despite her flamboyant public persona, La Lupe was deeply religious and reportedly never drank alcohol.[2]
- She managed and produced herself mid-career after parting ways with Tito Puente, demonstrating remarkable independence in a male-dominated industry.[2]
