## Biography
Kneebody is an American jazz-fusion band formed in 2001 out of overlapping circles of friends from the Eastman School of Music and the California Institute of the Arts, who converged in the vibrant Los Angeles scene.[1][2][5] The original lineup featured Adam Benjamin (keyboards), Shane Endsley (trumpet), Ben Wendel (tenor saxophone), Kaveh Rastegar (bass), and Nate Wood (drums), all of whom had met in their late teens as students and quickly became close musical collaborators.[1][2][3][5] After Eastman, Wendel and Rastegar moved to Los Angeles, and the group solidified through weekly residencies at venues like the Temple Bar and The Vic in Santa Monica, initially experimenting with jazz sets before gravitating toward a highly electrified, compositional approach that felt, in their own words, like something they had never heard before.[1][4] The band name "Kneebody" was a nonsense word coined by Wendel’s girlfriend to avoid any implication of a single leader or fixed stylistic meaning, reinforcing their collective ethos.[1]

From their self‑titled debut on Dave Douglas’ Greenleaf Music label in 2005 through albums such as *Low Electrical Worker* (2007), *You Can Have Your Moment* (2010), *The Line* (2013), *Kneedelus* with electronic artist Daedelus (2015), *Anti‑Hero* (2017), and *Chapters* (2019), Kneebody forged a sound that mixes explosive rock energy, complex chamber‑like writing, and open‑ended jazz improvisation.[1][2] Their 2009 collaboration with vocalist Theo Bleckmann on *Twelve Songs by Charles Ives* earned a Grammy nomination in the classical crossover category, marking a major milestone that highlighted their ability to reinterpret American modernist repertoire through a contemporary, groove-oriented lens.[1][2] Over time, their style has drawn on 1960s free‑bop, 1970s jazz‑rock, 1990s hip‑hop, and contemporary indie and electronic music, underpinned by a unique cue-based system on stage that allows any member to instantly alter tempo, key, feel, or form, making each performance highly interactive and structurally fluid.[2][5][8]

In 2019, founding bassist Kaveh Rastegar amicably left the group to pursue other projects, and Nate Wood began covering both bass and drums simultaneously—live and in the studio—turning Kneebody into a virtuosic quartet of Benjamin, Endsley, Wendel, and Wood.[1][2][4][5] By then, the band had amassed an international fanbase and a reputation as one of the most forward‑thinking ensembles in contemporary jazz, praised by peers such as Joshua Redman, who cited *Low Electrical Worker* as one of his favorite albums of 2007.[1][2] Continuing to tour globally and release new work, including the Edition Records projects *By Fire* (2019) and *Chapters* and the announcement of the album *Reach*, Kneebody has come to represent a bridge between jazz, rock, electronic, and experimental music, with a lasting legacy as a genre‑transcending collective rather than a leader‑centric band.[1][2][5]

## Fun Facts
- The name "Kneebody" is a made‑up word invented by saxophonist Ben Wendel’s girlfriend specifically so the band would not suggest any particular leader, style, or meaning.[1]
- Instead of replacing departing bassist Kaveh Rastegar in 2019, Nate Wood began playing bass and drums simultaneously, both live and in the studio, turning Kneebody into a quartet and creating a visually and sonically striking setup.[1][4][5]
- Kneebody uses a self‑developed cueing system on stage, allowing any member to instantly change the tempo, key, groove, or form with hand signals or musical gestures, which makes their performances highly spontaneous while still tightly structured.[2][8]
- Their album *Low Electrical Worker* (2007) was singled out by acclaimed saxophonist Joshua Redman as one of his favorite albums of that year, helping solidify their reputation among top‑tier jazz musicians and critics.[1][2]
