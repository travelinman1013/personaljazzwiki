## Biography
José Bezerra da Silva was born on February 23, 1927, in Recife, Pernambuco, Brazil. As a child, he played zabumba and sang coco, a Northeastern Brazilian folk style, before moving to Rio de Janeiro in 1942. His early years in Rio were marked by hardship; he lived as a street musician and faced periods of homelessness, but his musical talent eventually led him to work as a percussionist and session musician for Rádio Clube do Brasil and later as a member of the Orquestra Copacabana Discos and Orquestra da TV Globo. Bezerra studied classical guitar for eight years and became one of the few samba musicians able to read sheet music, further refining his craft.[1][2][4][5]

Bezerra da Silva's solo recording career began in 1969, and he released his first LP in 1975. Over the next three decades, he became a leading figure in samba, especially the partido alto style, releasing around 30 albums and selling over 3 million copies. His music is renowned for its sharp social commentary, addressing themes such as poverty, crime, and police violence in Rio's favelas. He became famous for recording sambas written by marginalized and unknown composers, acting as a 'porta-voz' (spokesperson) for the voiceless masses. His persona as the 'malandro do morro' (hill trickster) and his ironic, streetwise lyrics earned him both acclaim and controversy, with hits like 'Malandragem Dá Um Tempo' becoming cultural touchstones.[1][2][3][5][6]

Despite his popularity and critical success, Bezerra da Silva was often overlooked by the mainstream music industry. He collaborated with numerous artists and continued to innovate until his death in 2005. His legacy endures as a voice for the marginalized, a master of samba's partido alto, and a symbol of resistance and wit in Brazilian music.[1][2][5][6]
