## Biography
Carlos Santana was born on July 20, 1947, in Autlán de Navarro, Jalisco, Mexico, to José Santana, a professional mariachi violinist, and Josefina Barragán. He began learning violin at age five from his father but switched to guitar at eight, initially drawn to mariachi traditions before discovering American rock and blues through artists like T-Bone Walker, Muddy Waters, B.B. King, Chuck Berry, Howlin' Wolf, and James Brown while performing in Tijuana strip clubs and with local bands after the family moved there in 1955. By age 12, he worked as a roadie for pioneering Tijuana rock band the Tj's led by Javier Bátiz, later joining as bassist before pursuing guitar in other groups; the family relocated to San Francisco's Mission District in the early 1960s, where Santana endured personal hardships including sexual abuse, dropped out of Mission High School in 1965, and supported himself as a dishwasher and busker while immersing in the hippie scene, jazz, folk, and live performances by idols like B.B. King.[1][2][3]

In October 1966, Santana formed the Santana Blues Band with David Brown and Gregg Rolie, evolving it by 1968 into a fusion of electric blues, Latin rhythms, rock, jazz, and psychedelia; signed to Columbia Records, the band—shortened to Santana—recorded its debut album in 1969 after lineup changes including drummer Mike Shrieve and percussionists José 'Chepito' Areas and Michael Carabello. Their instrumental 'Soul Sacrifice' at Woodstock in 1969 propelled them to global fame, launching a string of successful albums through the early 1970s that defined Santana's signature style of Latin-infused rock blending salsa, African rhythms, and blues.[1][3][5]

Santana's career spans decades, pioneering 'world music' through genre-blending experiments, with later works like Africa Speaks (2019) showcasing enduring innovation; his legacy includes 10 Grammy Awards, induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and influence on fusion genres, marked by spiritual themes and collaborations that bridge cultural divides.[3][5][6]
