## Biography
Billy Eckstine (1914–1993) was a trailblazing American jazz and pop singer, renowned for his rich, operatic bass-baritone voice and charismatic stage presence. Born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Eckstine initially pursued athletics but turned to music after an injury. He rose to fame in the late 1930s as a vocalist and trumpeter with Earl Hines' Grand Terrace Orchestra in Chicago, recording hits like 'Stormy Monday Blues' and 'Jelly, Jelly.'

In 1944, Eckstine formed his own big band, which became a seminal incubator for the bebop movement, featuring future jazz legends such as Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, Miles Davis, and Sarah Vaughan. His orchestra was celebrated for its innovative arrangements and improvisational style, blending swing with the emerging bebop sound. Eckstine's solo career flourished in the late 1940s and 1950s, with chart-topping ballads like 'Prisoner of Love' and 'A Cottage for Sale.' He broke racial barriers as one of the first African American ballad singers to achieve mainstream success, influencing generations of vocalists. Eckstine continued to perform and record into the 1980s, earning a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award posthumously in 2019 for his profound impact on jazz and popular music.
