## Biography
The Bridge Trio is a jazz ensemble rooted in the vibrant musical traditions of New Orleans, Louisiana. Formed by drummer Joe Dyson, pianist Conun Pappas, and bassist Max Moran, the group emerged from their shared experiences at the New Orleans Center for the Creative Arts (NOCCA), where they studied under the legendary clarinetist and educator Alvin Batiste. As high school students, they performed with Batiste as part of the Jazztronauts and played with him during his final public appearance, later honoring his memory with a moving tribute at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival in 2007 on the day of his passing.[2][3]

The trio's music is deeply influenced by the New Orleans jazz tradition, but they are also recognized for their innovative approach, blending elements of R&B, hip-hop, soul, rock, and Afro-New Orleans rhythms—a style known as 'Nouveau Swing,' pioneered by saxophonist Donald Harrison, with whom all three have performed extensively. Each member is a graduate of a prestigious music institution: Joe Dyson and Max Moran from Berklee College of Music, and Conun Pappas from The New School for Jazz and Contemporary Music. The Bridge Trio has performed internationally at major festivals and venues, and their work has been featured in the HBO series 'Treme.'[2][3][4]

Known for their original compositions and dynamic interplay, The Bridge Trio stands as a testament to the next generation of New Orleans jazz virtuosos, carrying forward the city's musical legacy while pushing the boundaries of contemporary jazz.
