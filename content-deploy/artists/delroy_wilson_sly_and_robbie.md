## Biography
“Delroy Wilson, Sly & Robbie” is not a fixed performing group but refers to recordings where Jamaican singer **Delroy Wilson** is backed and/or produced by the legendary rhythm section and production team **Sly & Robbie** (drummer Sly Dunbar and bassist Robbie Shakespeare). In the late 1970s and early 1980s, as Wilson’s soulful tenor adapted to roots and early dancehall, he cut a number of sides at Channel One and other studios with Sly & Robbie providing the core drum-and-bass foundation, often released through labels linked to Channel One and Taxi.[2][6] These sessions placed Wilson’s veteran rocksteady/early reggae voice over the tougher, more modern “rockers” and early dancehall rhythms that Sly & Robbie were developing, helping to update his sound for a new generation of reggae and sound‑system listeners.[2][6]

Delroy George Wilson, born 5 October 1948 in Trench Town, Kingston, Jamaica, began recording at 13 for producer Clement “Coxsone” Dodd’s Studio One label and is widely regarded as Jamaica’s first child star.[2][4] He scored early ska hits such as “Emy Lou” and “Joe Liges” and then became one of the great voices of the rocksteady era with songs like “Dancing Mood,” “Conquer Me,” and “Riding for a Fall.”[2][4] Through the late 1960s and 1970s he recorded for key producers including Bunny “Striker” Lee, Sonia Pottinger, Keith Hudson, Lloyd Charmers and others, earning the nickname **“The Cool Operator”** and later **“The Dean of Reggae.”**[2][4][6] Sly & Robbie—already central to the sound of Channel One, the Revolutionaries and their Taxi label—worked with Wilson during this mature period, cutting sides that matched his smooth, emotionally rich vocals with their hard, propulsive riddims.[1][2][6]

Sly Dunbar (b. Kingston, Jamaica) and Robbie Shakespeare (b. Kingston, d. 2020) had by then become the premier drum-and-bass team in reggae, playing on and producing countless hits for artists such as Black Uhuru, Peter Tosh, Gregory Isaacs and many more, and later working with international acts like Grace Jones, Bob Dylan and the Rolling Stones.[1][7] Their collaborations with Delroy Wilson fit into this broader project of modernizing and globalizing Jamaican music while still honoring its roots: Wilson brought the lineage of ska and rocksteady vocal phrasing, while Sly & Robbie supplied the innovative rhythmic frameworks and dubwise sensibility that would dominate late‑70s and 80s reggae.[1][2][6] Together, “Delroy Wilson, Sly & Robbie” recordings stand as a bridge between classic rocksteady crooning and the heavyweight, bass‑driven sound that made Jamaican music a global force.

## Fun Facts
- Delroy Wilson is widely described as Jamaica’s first child star in popular music, having started his recording career at around 13 years old while still at Boys Town Primary School.[2][4]
- His nickname “The Cool Operator” came from his unflappable, smooth vocal delivery and was later joined by the honorific “The Dean of Reggae” in recognition of his long service from ska through roots and early dancehall.[2][6]
- Delroy Wilson’s double A‑side single “It Hurts” / “Put Yourself in My Place,” produced by Sonia Pottinger, became a cult favorite among British skinhead reggae fans and narrowly missed entering the UK charts.[2][4]
- Sly & Robbie, who backed Wilson on late‑1970s and early‑1980s sessions, went on to become in‑demand producers for major international artists such as Grace Jones, Bob Dylan and the Rolling Stones, making Wilson part of the wider story of reggae’s global crossover.[1][7]
