## Biography
Catherine Russell, born in 1956 in New York City, is an acclaimed American jazz and blues vocalist renowned for her deep connection to the roots of swing, jazz, and blues. The daughter of two jazz luminaries—Panamanian-born bandleader and Louis Armstrong’s longtime musical director Luis Russell, and pioneering guitarist/vocalist Carline Ray—she was immersed in music from an early age, absorbing the sounds of early jazz, R&B, and even country music. Her mother’s background included performing with the International Sweethearts of Rhythm, the first integrated all-women’s big band in the U.S., and her father’s orchestras were central to the jazz scene of the 1920s and 1930s.[1][4][8]

Russell’s career began as a highly sought-after backup singer and multi-instrumentalist, touring and recording with artists such as David Bowie, Steely Dan, Cyndi Lauper, Paul Simon, Rosanne Cash, and Wynton Marsalis. Her transition to a solo career came in 2006 with the release of her debut album 'Cat,' which marked the start of a new chapter as a leading interpreter of vintage jazz and R&B. Her subsequent albums, including the Grammy-nominated 'Harlem on My Mind' and 'Alone Together,' have garnered critical acclaim, and she has become a fixture at major jazz festivals and venues worldwide. Russell is celebrated for her impeccable pitch, storytelling ability, and her role in preserving and revitalizing classic American music.[1][2][5][6][7]

Her musical style is deeply rooted in swing, blues, and jazz traditions, characterized by a warm, expressive voice and a commitment to authentic interpretations of classic repertoire. Russell’s legacy is defined by her ability to bridge generations, honoring her family’s musical heritage while inspiring contemporary audiences and musicians alike.[1][2][5][6]
