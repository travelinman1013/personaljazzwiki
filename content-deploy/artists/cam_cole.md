## Biography
Cam Cole is a British one-man band and singer-songwriter born on November 20, 1992, in London, United Kingdom.[2] He began his musical journey at age 7 when he started playing guitar, and after initially attempting to establish himself in the London band scene, he made the unconventional decision to become a full-time 'new age traveller,' living in a van while pursuing his musical dreams.[5] Starting as a street busker on the corners of London, particularly in Camden, Cam's viral social media videos and authentic performances earned him a loyal fanbase and millions of streams, transforming him from a street musician into an international touring artist.[2][4] His rise to prominence was marked by a cameo appearance on the Emmy-winning television series Ted Lasso, which significantly boosted his visibility and credibility in the music industry.[2][4]

Cam Cole is renowned as 'the heaviest one-man band in the world,' masterfully blending blues, folk, grunge, stoner rock, and metal into a singular, powerful live experience.[3][4] His distinctive sound is characterized by drop-tuned guitars (typically tuned to 'B' with five heavy gauge strings), aggressive distorted vocals delivered through a classic Shure 'Green Bullet' microphone, and the rhythmic foundation provided by custom Farmer Footdrums that he operates with his feet while simultaneously playing guitar and singing.[5] With three studio albums to his name—including his third album 'Unleash' released in August 2023 and recorded live at the legendary Rockfield Studios in Wales—Cam has successfully navigated the difficult transition from street musician to international touring artist without compromising the raw authenticity that made him unique.[2][4] His live performances have evolved into what he describes as a 'full-fledged rock 'n' roll circus,' incorporating circus and percussive elements from his crew, the New Age Collective, and he continues to sell out club shows across the UK, Europe, USA, Canada, Mexico, and Australia.[3][4]

Cam's creative process is organic and intuitive, drawing inspiration from classic rock and blues legends like Led Zeppelin, Nirvana, and Kyuss, as well as the raw energy of Rage Against The Machine.[5] His music serves as a contemporary bridge between blues history and modern rock aggression, earning him comparisons to artists like The White Stripes and recognition as one of the most impressive live performers in the contemporary rock scene. His work has been produced and mixed by Markus Stretz and mastered by Brian Lucey of The Black Keys, further cementing his place in the modern rock landscape.[4]

## Fun Facts
- Cam Cole is known as 'the heaviest one-man band on the planet' and performs using custom Farmer Footdrums that he operates with his feet while simultaneously playing guitar and singing, creating the sound of a full band entirely by himself.[1][2]
- He uses a Shure 'Green Bullet' microphone—a classic harmonica blues microphone dating back to 1949—run through a distorted amp to achieve his distinctive aggressive vocal tone, demonstrating his deep knowledge of vintage audio equipment.[5]
- Cam's guitar is drop-tuned to 'B' with five heavy gauge strings, an unusual tuning typically associated with heavy metal that allows him to produce the darker, heavier sound characteristic of his music.[5]
- He has lived as a 'new age traveller' in a van for nearly 10 years while pursuing his music career, starting as a street busker in London before achieving international success and touring across the UK, Europe, USA, Canada, Mexico, and Australia.[5][4]
