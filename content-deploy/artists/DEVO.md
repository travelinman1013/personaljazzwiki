## Biography
Devo is an American new wave band formed in Akron, Ohio, in 1973 by art students Gerald Casale and Bob Lewis, later joined by Mark Mothersbaugh. The band's classic lineup featured two sets of brothers—Mark and Bob Mothersbaugh, Gerald and Bob Casale—and drummer Alan Myers. Devo's origins are closely tied to the political unrest and tragedy of the Kent State shootings in 1970, which deeply influenced their satirical concept of 'de-evolution': the idea that instead of progressing, society was regressing, a theme that became central to their music and visual identity.

Devo quickly became known for their fusion of punk, rock, and electronic music, as well as their eccentric stage personas and science fiction-inspired costumes. Their debut album, 'Q: Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo!' (1978), produced by Brian Eno with input from David Bowie, established them as pioneers of the new wave movement. The band achieved mainstream success with the 1980 single 'Whip It' from their album 'Freedom of Choice,' which became a double-platinum hit and cemented their place in pop culture. Throughout the 1980s, Devo continued to experiment with synthpop and electronic sounds while maintaining their signature satirical edge.

Devo's innovative approach to music videos, performance art, and social commentary has left a lasting legacy, influencing genres from alternative rock to industrial music and even inspiring the internet microgenre 'devo-core.' Their work has been recognized for its prophetic critique of conformity and consumerism, and they remain celebrated as one of the most original and influential acts to emerge from the American post-punk and new wave scenes.

## Fun Facts

- Their iconic energy dome hats, first worn during the 'Freedom of Choice' era, were designed to be both visually striking and to allegedly 'focus the wearer's energy.'
- Devo was one of the first bands to fully embrace music videos as an art form, producing surreal and innovative videos before the rise of MTV.
- The band appeared as 'nuclear garbagepersons' in Neil Young's cult film 'Human Highway,' writing their own parts and contributing to the soundtrack.
