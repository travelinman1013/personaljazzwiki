## Biography
Cornel Campbell, born on 23 November 1945 in Kingston, Jamaica, began his singing career in his local church choir and entered the music industry at age eleven in 1956, introduced by trombonist Rico Rodriguez to Clement Dodd's Studio One, where he recorded his debut single 'My Treasure'. As Jamaican music evolved from rhythm and blues to ska, he released further singles like 'Turndown Date' backed by The Skatalites, later recording with King Edwards and The Bell Stars, then at Duke Reid's Treasure Isle, forming The Sensations with Jimmy Riley, Buster Riley, and Aaron Davis. After The Sensations split, he led The Eternals with Ken Price and Errol Wisdom, scoring hits like 'Queen of the Minstrel' and 'Stars', and briefly joined The Uniques in the 1960s.[1][3][4]

Transitioning to a solo career in 1971, Campbell forged a pivotal partnership with producer Bunny Lee, initially in lovers rock before incorporating roots reggae, highlighted by his self-titled debut album in 1973 and mid-1970s peaks with the 'flying hi-hat' sound on hits such as 'Natty Dread in a Greenwich Farm', 'Dance in a Greenwich Farm', and 'The Gorgon', known as 'Gorgon rock'. He achieved further success with 'Boxing' for Joe Gibbs in the early 1980s rub-a-dub era and recordings for producers like Winston Holness and Winston Riley. Campbell revived The Uniques in the late 1970s with Jimmy Riley and Lloyd Charmers, releasing *Showcase vol. 1* and *Give Thanks* in 1979, and again in 1997 with Jimmy Riley and Al Campbell. Later collaborations included Rhythm & Sound's 'King in My Empire' in 2001 and Soothsayers in 2013, with recent releases like 'Change Your Ways (feat. Yakka)' in 2025 maintaining his legacy, renowned for his distinctive falsetto voice across genres including roots reggae, rocksteady, lovers rock, reggae, and dub.[1][3][5]

Campbell's career spans decades, shifting from ska and group vocals to solo roots anthems and lovers rock, with a strong following persisting despite fewer new recordings post-mid-1980s. His work with Bunny Lee in the 1970s solidified his status, and revivals with The Uniques underscore his enduring influence in Jamaican music.[1][2]
