## Biography
The Doohickeys is a country comedy duo consisting of Haley Spence Brown and Jack Hackett, who met while studying comedy at the University of Southern California (USC) in Los Angeles. Haley hails from Liberty, Missouri, where she grew up training horses and helping on her grandfather's cattle farm, fostering her country roots. Jack, raised in a strict Japanese-American household in Atlanta, Georgia, discovered their shared love for country music at a Halloween party when Haley heard Kenny Chesney playing, leading them to write their first song, 'I Wish My Truck Was Bigger,' the next day.[1][2][5]

Their career took off with the debut album *All Hat No Cattle*, released January 24, 2025, which charted #1 on the Roots Music Report and #21 on Americana Radio charts, featuring singles on SiriusXM’s Outlaw Country. The duo blends humorous satire of country tropes—like truck machismo, small-town life, and rural insecurities—with thoughtful commentary, as in 'This Town Sucks' and the body-positive 'I Wish My Truck Was Bigger,' originally written for sketch comedy. Produced by Eric Corne, the album showcases their radio-friendly, knee-slapping style influenced by artists like Dolly Parton, John Prine, and Randy Newman.[1][2][3]

Based in Glendale, California, The Doohickeys have built a massive online following since June 2024, with over 20 million Instagram views and 10 million on TikTok. They've performed at prestigious venues like the Bluebird Cafe, Hotel Cafe, Desert 5 Spot, and Ryman Auditorium (opening for Jim Jefferies), and earned accolades including a video win for 'Rein It In Cowboy' in American Songwriter Magazine's contest and an Outstanding Songwriting award for 'This Town Sucks' in the 2023 Great American Song Contest, establishing their legacy as a fresh, wholesome voice in country humor.[1][3]
