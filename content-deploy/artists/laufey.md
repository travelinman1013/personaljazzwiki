## Biography
Laufey Lín Jónsdóttir, born April 23, 1999, in Reykjavík, Iceland, to a Chinese mother—a classical violinist in the Iceland Symphony Orchestra—and an Icelandic father, grew up immersed in music, splitting time between Reykjavík and Washington, D.C. Her family environment, including her mother and sister as violinists and her grandfather as a violin teacher in China, fostered early training in violin, piano, and cello; by age 15, she performed as a soloist with the Iceland Symphony Orchestra and reached the finals of Iceland’s Got Talent in 2014, followed by semifinals on The Voice Iceland as its youngest competitor.[1][2][3][4] Classically trained, Laufey drew inspiration from jazz legends like Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald, and Chet Baker, blending these with the Great American Songbook during her studies at Berklee College of Music, where she earned a Presidential Scholarship and graduated in 2021.[3]

Her career ignited in 2020 amid COVID-19 lockdown when she self-released her debut single 'Street By Street'—written after a heartbreak—which went viral, topped Icelandic charts, and led to hosting BBC Radio 3's 'Happy Harmonies.' This paved the way for her 2021 EP *Typical of Me*, earning Best New Artist in Jazz & Blues at the Icelandic Music Awards, and her debut album *Everything I Know About Love* in 2022, which hit Top 10 on Spotify in the US and UK, sold out tours backed by orchestras, and featured a Jimmy Kimmel Live! performance of 'Like The Movies.'[1][3] In 2024, her second album *Bewitched* set a Spotify record for the biggest jazz debut, with over 1 billion streams and a Grammy nomination for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album, showcasing her signature fusion of classical, jazz, and contemporary pop through dreamy arrangements with harp, bassoon, celesta, and strings.[2][3]

Now based in Los Angeles, the 26-year-old Chinese-Icelandic singer-songwriter, cellist, and pianist continues reinventing jazz and classical for young audiences, bridging tradition and modernity with emotive, cinematic songwriting about love and vulnerability, cementing her as a Grammy-nominated star with timeless elegance.[1][2][3]
