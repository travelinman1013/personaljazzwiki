## Biography
Yola, The Highwomen, and Sheryl Crow are interconnected through their collaborations in the Americana, retro soul, and folk genres, each bringing distinct backgrounds and legacies to their music. Yola (Yolanda Claire Quartey), born in Bristol, England in 1983, overcame significant adversity in her early life, including homelessness and family discouragement, to become a critically acclaimed singer-songwriter. Her debut album 'Walk Through Fire' (2019) earned four Grammy nominations, followed by 'Stand for Myself' (2021), which garnered two more. Yola's music is rooted in her Jamaican heritage and blends country, soul, and Americana, setting her apart in these genres. She has also made notable acting debuts, portraying Sister Rosetta Tharpe in Baz Luhrmann's 'Elvis' and starring on Broadway in 'Hadestown.'[2][4]

The Highwomen is a supergroup formed in 2019, consisting of Brandi Carlile, Amanda Shires, Maren Morris, and Natalie Hemby. Their project was conceived as a response to the male-dominated country supergroup The Highwaymen, aiming to amplify women's voices in country and Americana. The group’s debut album features collaborations with Yola and Sheryl Crow, notably on the song 'Highwomen,' which reflects on women's experiences throughout history. Yola’s powerful vocals and Sheryl Crow’s seasoned musicianship brought additional depth to the group’s message and sound.[1][6]

Sheryl Crow, born in Kennett, Missouri in 1962, began her career as a music teacher and jingle singer before becoming a backup vocalist for Michael Jackson, Sting, and Rod Stewart. Her breakthrough came with 'Tuesday Night Music Club' (1993), launching a career that has spanned decades and earned her nine Grammy Awards. Crow’s style fuses rock, pop, country, and folk, and she remains a respected figure in American music, known for her collaborations and advocacy. Her work with Yola and The Highwomen underscores her commitment to supporting female artists and genre-crossing musical innovation.[3][5]
