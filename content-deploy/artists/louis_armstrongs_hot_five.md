## Biography
Louis Armstrong's Hot Five was a **studio recording group** formed in Chicago in late 1925 as the first ensemble to record under Louis Armstrong's own name, marking a turning point in both his career and in the history of jazz.[2][4][8] Organized after Armstrong left Fletcher Henderson’s New York band and returned to Chicago at the urging of his wife and pianist Lillian (Lil) Hardin Armstrong, the Hot Five drew on Armstrong’s New Orleans roots while taking full advantage of the emerging recording industry.[3][4][5] The original lineup featured Armstrong on cornet, Johnny Dodds on clarinet, Kid Ory on trombone, Lil Armstrong on piano, and Johnny St. Cyr on banjo/guitar, and the group recorded primarily for OKeh Records in Chicago.[2][3][8] The band did not function as a regular touring unit; apart from a single publicity performance, it existed almost entirely in the studio, allowing Armstrong and his colleagues to focus on innovative small‑group arrangements and improvisation.[3]

Between November 1925 and 1928, Louis Armstrong and His Hot Five (and its expanded variant, the Hot Seven) recorded more than fifty sides that fundamentally changed the course of jazz, with landmarks such as “Cornet Chop Suey,” “Struttin’ With Some Barbecue,” “Hotter Than That,” and especially the 1927 recording “Potato Head Blues,” whose two improvised solos are widely cited as breakthroughs in jazz phrasing and swing.[1][2][7][9] Over several personnel changes and the brief transformation into the **Hot Seven** (adding tuba and drums for sessions in May 1927), Armstrong refined a style that shifted jazz from a collective New Orleans ensemble approach toward the primacy of the individual soloist, showcasing his rhythmic freedom, daring high notes, and melodic invention while still retaining a relaxed New Orleans rhythmic feel.[2][3][4] These recordings are often regarded as Armstrong’s most important early work and a cornerstone in the emergence of modern jazz, establishing him as the first great jazz soloist and setting enduring standards for improvisers across genres.[2][4][9]

The musical style of the Hot Five combined New Orleans ensemble polyphony with an increasingly solo‑centric structure built around Armstrong’s cornet (and later trumpet) leads, scat‑inflected phrasing, and a sense of swing that anticipated later big‑band and small‑group jazz.[2][4][8] Lil Armstrong’s arrangements and compositions, along with contributions from Dodds, Ory, and St. Cyr, provided settings that highlighted Louis’s virtuosity, vocal personality, and rhythmic daring.[3][5][8] The legacy of the Hot Five and Hot Seven sessions extends well beyond their original 78‑rpm releases: they are routinely cited by historians as among the most influential recordings in jazz history, credited with transforming jazz from a primarily collective folk‑derived music into a soloist’s art and inspiring generations of musicians in swing, bebop, and beyond.[2][4][7][9]

## Fun Facts
- Louis Armstrong’s Hot Five was essentially a **studio‑only band**: apart from a single public performance staged for publicity, it did not function as a regular touring group and existed almost entirely for recording sessions.[3]
- The Hot Five’s very first session as a leader project for Armstrong took place on **November 12, 1925** at the OKeh studios in Chicago, launching a series of recordings now regarded as among the most influential in jazz history.[2][7][8]
- For five sessions in May 1927 the group was expanded with tuba and drums and briefly rebranded as the **Hot Seven**, before later personnel changes effectively turned the band into a “Hot Six” in 1928 while still using the Hot Five name.[3]
- The 1927 Hot Seven/Hot Five era recording of “Potato Head Blues” is frequently singled out by historians for Armstrong’s two improvised solos, which are described as a breakthrough that set new standards for jazz improvisation.[1][2]

## Musical Connections

### Mentors/Influences
- [[king_oliver|King Oliver]] - Armstrong’s earlier New Orleans bandleader and mentor whose Creole Jazz Band model and cornet style formed a foundation for the small‑group New Orleans aesthetic that the Hot Five modernized in the studio. (Pre‑Hot Five recordings with King Oliver’s Creole Jazz Band; influence reflected implicitly in Hot Five ensemble passages.) [Early 1920s, especially 1922–1924 (before Hot Five sessions).]
- [[fletcher_henderson|Fletcher Henderson]] - New York bandleader with whom Armstrong played before returning to Chicago; Henderson’s more arranged big‑band context helped sharpen Armstrong’s soloist role, which he fully realized in the Hot Five recordings. (Recordings with Fletcher Henderson’s Orchestra (1924–1925) that predate and inform Armstrong’s Hot Five approach.) [1924–1925, immediately prior to formation of the Hot Five.[2][3][4]]
- [[bessie_smith|Bessie Smith]] - Blues singer whose 1925 recording session with Armstrong showcased his early improvisational power and blues phrasing, directly preceding the Hot Five work and shaping his lyrical, vocal‑like solo style. (1925 recording session with Bessie Smith (e.g., blues accompaniments) that highlighted Armstrong’s developing improvisation just before the Hot Five era.[2]) [1925, immediately before the first Hot Five recordings.]

### Key Collaborators
- [[louis_armstrong|Louis Armstrong]] - Cornetist/bandleader and central creative force of the Hot Five, whose leadership, solos, and compositions defined the group’s sound and historical importance. (All Hot Five and Hot Seven recordings for OKeh Records, including “Cornet Chop Suey,” “Struttin’ With Some Barbecue,” “Hotter Than That,” and “Potato Head Blues.”[1][2][7][8]) [1925–1928.]
- [[lillian_lil_hardin_armstrong|Lillian (Lil) Hardin Armstrong]] - Pianist, arranger, composer, and Louis Armstrong’s wife; she urged him to leave Fletcher Henderson, return to Chicago, and effectively architected the Hot Five project while providing crucial compositions and piano accompaniment. (Hot Five recordings as pianist and composer/arranger, notably various OKeh sessions from 1925–1927; leadership role in organizing the band at Dreamland and for the studio.[2][3][5][8]) [Hot Five era 1925–1928.]
- [[johnny_dodds|Johnny Dodds]] - Clarinetist whose New Orleans‑style clarinet lines and solos provided a key counter‑voice to Armstrong, enriching the polyphonic texture of the Hot Five. (Core Hot Five sides from 1925–1927, including early sessions beginning November 12, 1925, and classic titles recorded in Chicago.[2][3][8]) [1925–1927 with the Hot Five.]
- [[kid_ory|Kid Ory]] - Trombonist whose tailgate‑style trombone anchored the traditional New Orleans ensemble sound within the Hot Five’s more modern, solo‑oriented framework. (Original Hot Five recordings for OKeh, including early 1925–1927 sessions in Chicago.[2][3][8]) [1925–1927 with the Hot Five.]
- [[johnny_st._cyr|Johnny St. Cyr]] - Banjoist/guitarist whose chordal rhythm and occasional solos provided harmonic support and drive for the Hot Five’s small‑group arrangements. (Hot Five recordings for OKeh, including the inaugural November 12, 1925 session and subsequent sides.[2][3][5][8]) [1925–1927 with the Hot Five.]
- [[members_of_the_hot_seven_tuba_and_drums_additions|Members of the Hot Seven (tuba and drums additions)]] - Additional rhythm section players (tuba and drums) who joined for the 1927 Hot Seven sessions, thickening the texture and helping transition the group toward a slightly larger ensemble sound. (Hot Seven recordings from May 1927 sessions in Chicago, including classics recorded with extended rhythm section.[2][3]) [May 1927.]

### Artists Influenced
- [[later_jazz_soloists_and_modern_jazz_musicians_collective_category|Later jazz soloists and modern jazz musicians (collective category)]] - The Hot Five and Hot Seven recordings are widely credited with establishing Armstrong as the first great jazz soloist and transforming jazz into a soloist‑centered art, providing a model of phrasing, swing, and melodic invention that influenced virtually all subsequent jazz improvisers. (Influence traceable to the full body of Hot Five/Hot Seven recordings (1925–1928), particularly “Potato Head Blues” and other celebrated sides that became touchstones for later players.[2][4][9]) [From the late 1920s onward, affecting swing, bebop, and later styles.]
- [[swingera_and_bigband_musicians_collective_category|Swing‑era and big‑band musicians (collective category)]] - Armstrong’s Hot Five solos and rhythmic feel helped shape the language later adopted by swing‑era horn players and bandleaders, even as those musicians worked in larger ensembles. (Hot Five and Hot Seven recordings of 1925–1928 that redefined solo prominence and swing feel in small‑group jazz, later echoed in big‑band contexts.[2][4][9]) [1930s–1940s swing era and beyond.]
