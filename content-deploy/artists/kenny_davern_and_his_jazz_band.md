## Biography
Kenny Davern was born John Kenneth Davern on January 7, 1935, in Huntington, Long Island, New York. He began his musical journey as a teenager, quickly immersing himself in the vibrant New York jazz scene. Initially drawn to the baritone saxophone, Davern soon found his true voice in the clarinet, inspired by the legendary Pee Wee Russell. His early exposure to Dixieland jazz shaped his musical direction, and he became known for his mastery of both traditional and modern jazz styles.[2][3][5][8]

Davern's career flourished as he collaborated with some of the most significant figures in jazz, including the likes of Bob Wilber, with whom he co-led the Soprano Summit, a group celebrated for its innovative approach to classic jazz repertoire. His playing was characterized by a robust tone, technical brilliance, and a deep reverence for the jazz tradition, particularly the sounds of New Orleans and swing. Over the decades, Davern recorded extensively, both as a leader and sideman, and his work helped keep the clarinet at the forefront of jazz expression well into the late 20th century.[4][7][8]

Kenny Davern's legacy endures through his recordings and the musicians he influenced. He is remembered as one of the foremost clarinetists in jazz, celebrated for his passionate performances and commitment to the art form. Davern passed away on December 12, 2006, leaving behind a rich musical heritage that continues to inspire clarinetists and jazz enthusiasts worldwide.[1][2][8]
