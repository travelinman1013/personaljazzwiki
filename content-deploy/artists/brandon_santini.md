## Biography
Brandon Santini is a modern blues harmonica player, singer, and songwriter born in the Piedmont region of North Carolina—specifically in Burlington or Chapel Hill, according to various sources. Raised on the historic Beale Street in Memphis, Tennessee, Santini was drawn to music from a young age, initially inspired by the pop and rock his parents played. At age fifteen, after hearing John Popper of Blues Traveler, he bought his first harmonica and quickly became captivated by the sounds of blues legends like Paul Butterfield, James Cotton, and Junior Wells. Largely self-taught, Santini honed his craft by listening to records and absorbing the culture and techniques of the Delta and North Mississippi Hill Country blues scenes.

In 2003, Santini moved to Memphis, where he became a fixture on Beale Street, performing regularly at venues such as the Rum Boogie Cafe and Blues Hall. He co-founded the acclaimed band Delta Highway, which was active until 2009, before launching a solo career that has seen him tour extensively across North America, Europe, South America, India, and Egypt. Now based in Springfield, Illinois, Santini is recognized for his high-energy blend of traditional blues with a contemporary edge, soulful vocals, and electrifying harmonica style. He has released several albums, received multiple Blues Music Award nominations, and won a Blues Blast Music Award for Contemporary Blues Album in 2019.

Santini's legacy is that of a torchbearer for the blues in the 21st century, bridging classic influences with modern sensibilities. His collaborations with artists like Buddy Guy, Gary Clark Jr., Beth Hart, and Sam the Sham, along with his leadership in bands such as Tennessee Redemption, have cemented his reputation as a passionate and innovative force in American roots music.
