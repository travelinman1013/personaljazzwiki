## Biography
Brian Stoltz and Shannon McNally are American roots and blues-oriented musicians who have intersected through the New Orleans scene and collaborative recording projects. Stoltz is best known as a New Orleans guitarist associated with funk and R&B traditions, while McNally is a singer‑songwriter whose work bridges Americana, country, and modern blues. Together, they have appeared on New Orleans–focused projects and sessions that highlight their complementary strengths: Stoltz’s deep, groove‑based guitar work and McNally’s soulful, narrative‑driven vocals.[1][2][4][6][8]

Stoltz’s career is closely tied to the New Orleans funk lineage, particularly through his role as guitarist with incarnations of The Meters and related projects, carrying forward the rhythmic and harmonic language of that city’s R&B and funk traditions.[2][4][6][8] McNally, meanwhile, has built a career as a roots-based singer and songwriter, appearing on tributes and collaborative concerts that connect her interpretive singing to classic New Orleans repertoire such as Bobby Charles’ material and Dr. John–related projects.[2][4] Their names appear together on New Orleans–centered releases and live line‑ups, where Stoltz often serves as a core band guitarist and McNally as a featured vocalist, situating both artists in the broader modern blues and roots continuum tied to New Orleans.[1][2][4][5][6][8]
