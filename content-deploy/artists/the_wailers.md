## Biography
The Wailers, formed in 1963 in Kingston, Jamaica, are widely regarded as one of the most influential reggae bands in history. The original lineup featured Bob Marley, Peter Tosh, and Bunny Wailer, who began their musical journey as The Teenagers before adopting the name The Wailers. Their early music was rooted in ska and rocksteady, reflecting the vibrant yet turbulent atmosphere of Jamaica in the 1960s. Their first major hit, 'Simmer Down,' recorded with the Skatalites at Studio One, became an anthem urging peace among Jamaica's youth and established The Wailers as a force in the local music scene[1][2][6].

As their sound evolved, The Wailers collaborated with legendary producers like Lee 'Scratch' Perry and Leslie Kong, incorporating deeper basslines and socially conscious lyrics that would come to define reggae. The addition of the Barrett brothers—Aston 'Family Man' Barrett on bass and Carlton Barrett on drums—further solidified their signature sound. Their partnership with Island Records in 1972, under the guidance of Chris Blackwell, marked their international breakthrough. Albums like 'Catch a Fire' and 'Burnin'' introduced reggae to a global audience, blending Jamaican rhythms with rock production techniques and addressing themes of resistance, unity, and spirituality[1][2].

After Tosh and Bunny Wailer departed in 1974, Marley continued to lead a new incarnation of the band, now known as Bob Marley and the Wailers, achieving worldwide fame until Marley's death in 1981. The Wailers' legacy endures through their timeless music, which has inspired countless artists and helped establish reggae as a global genre synonymous with messages of hope and social justice[1][2][4].

- After Bob Marley's death, various members continued to perform as The Wailers, with Aston 'Family Man' Barrett leading several touring lineups[3][7].
