## Biography
Jelly Roll Morton and His Red Hot Peppers were a seminal jazz ensemble led by Ferdinand 'Jelly Roll' Morton, one of the most influential early jazz composers and pianists. Morton was born Ferdinand Joseph Lamothe (sometimes listed as LaMothe or LaMenthe) in New Orleans, Louisiana, in either 1885 or 1890, to a Creole family. He began playing piano at age 10 and was soon performing in the brothels of Storyville, New Orleans' red-light district, where he developed a unique style blending ragtime, blues, and early jazz. Morton's early experiences in New Orleans, coupled with his travels across the United States as a young man, exposed him to a wide variety of musical influences and performance styles.

In the mid-1920s, after stints in Los Angeles and Chicago, Morton assembled the Red Hot Peppers, a group of top-tier New Orleans musicians, to record for the Victor label. The band, active from 1926 to 1930, included such luminaries as Kid Ory, Johnny Dodds, Omer Simeon, Johnny St. Cyr, and Baby Dodds. Their recordings, including 'Black Bottom Stomp,' 'Smoke-House Blues,' and 'Doctor Jazz,' set new standards for small group jazz, showcasing Morton's sophisticated arrangements and the ensemble's balance of tight structure and improvisational freedom. The Red Hot Peppers were known for their careful rehearsals, a rarity in early jazz, and their work is considered foundational in the development of jazz composition and performance.

Morton's influence extended far beyond his own recordings. He was among the first to notate jazz arrangements, helping to legitimize the genre in the eyes of the broader music industry. Though his style was eventually seen as old-fashioned as jazz evolved, Morton's innovations in form, harmony, and ensemble interplay left an indelible mark on the genre. His later years were marked by financial hardship, but a series of Library of Congress interviews in the late 1930s revived interest in his music and cemented his legacy as a pioneering architect of jazz.
