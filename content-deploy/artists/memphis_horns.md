## Biography
The Memphis Horns were an iconic American horn section, best known for their foundational role in shaping the 'Memphis sound' that defined soul, R&B, and pop music from the 1960s onward. The core duo consisted of Wayne Jackson on trumpet, born in West Memphis, Arkansas, and Andrew Love on tenor saxophone, raised in Memphis, Tennessee. Both musicians developed their talents early: Jackson began playing trumpet at age eleven and joined the Mar-Keys in high school, contributing to Stax Records' earliest successes, while Love honed his skills in his father's church and at Willie Mitchell’s Hi Records.

Their partnership began in 1965 at Stax Records, where they quickly became the go-to horn section for the label’s biggest acts, including Otis Redding, Sam & Dave, and Booker T. & the MGs. In 1969, seeking greater creative freedom, Jackson and Love officially formed The Memphis Horns, becoming a freelance horn section in high demand across the music industry. Their signature blend of tight, melodic brass arrangements graced over 100 charting singles and 83 gold and platinum records, including classics like Otis Redding’s '(Sittin’ On) The Dock of the Bay,' Al Green’s 'Let’s Stay Together,' and Elvis Presley’s 'Suspicious Minds.'

Their influence extended well beyond Stax, as they collaborated with artists from U2 and Peter Gabriel to Billy Joel and Neil Young. The Memphis Horns' sound became synonymous with soul and pop, earning them a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2012. Their legacy endures as pioneers who set the standard for horn sections in popular music, inspiring generations of musicians and leaving an indelible mark on American music history.
