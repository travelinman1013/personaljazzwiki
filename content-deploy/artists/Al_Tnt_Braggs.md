## Biography
Al 'TNT' Braggs was born on May 23, 1938, in Dallas, Texas, into a deeply musical and spiritual family. His father was a preacher and his mother sang spirituals at home, nurturing Al’s earliest musical education in gospel music. He began singing behind his mother and soon became a soloist in the Salem Baptist Church Choir. By 1950, he had formed his first gospel group, The Spiritual Stirrers, before shifting his interest to rhythm and blues and forming The Five Notes in 1952. Inspired by vocal groups like The Orioles, The Flamingos, and The Moonglows, Braggs and his group were discovered by Dallas DJ Chuck Donaway and recorded for Chess Records, launching a multi-state tour that established his reputation beyond Texas.[3]

Throughout the late 1950s and 1960s, Braggs performed as a solo artist and with groups such as The Five Notes, The Five Stars, and The Five Masks, and later fronted the Al 'TNT' Braggs Revue. His dynamic stage presence, energetic dance routines, and soulful vocals made him a standout performer in the northern soul and R&B scenes. He was also a prolific songwriter, penning hits for artists like Bobby Bland ('Call On Me,' 'Save Your Love For Me,' 'I'm Gonna Cry') and Sam Cooke ('London Bridge Is Fallin' Down'). Braggs was known for arranging his own shows, designing costumes, and leading his bands with precision and flair.[3][1]

Braggs’ influence extended through his collaborations with family members, notably his brother Floyd Braggs, and other musicians such as Rhetta Kelly and Mary Jackson. He continued performing into the 1980s with the Forever Fabulous Chickenhawks Showband & All-Star Revue. Al 'TNT' Braggs passed away on December 3, 2003, in Dallas, Texas, leaving behind a legacy as a vibrant performer, songwriter, and innovator in soul and R&B music.[1][3]
