## Biography
Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin were two of the most iconic figures in American entertainment, though they are often discussed individually rather than as a duo. **Frank Sinatra** was born on December 12, 1915, in Hoboken, New Jersey, and rose to fame as a singer and actor. He is renowned for his smooth baritone voice and his roles in films like 'From Here to Eternity' and 'Ocean's Eleven.' Sinatra's career spanned over six decades, with hits like 'My Way' and 'Fly Me to the Moon.' He was a key member of the Rat Pack, a group of entertainers that included Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., Joey Bishop, and Peter Lawford. **Dean Martin**, born Dino Paul Crocetti on June 7, 1917, in Steubenville, Ohio, was a singer, actor, and comedian. He gained fame with Jerry Lewis before pursuing a solo career and joining the Rat Pack. Martin's hits include 'That's Amore' and 'Everybody Loves Somebody.' Both Sinatra and Martin were known for their charisma and effortless charm, which captivated audiences worldwide. Their friendship and collaborations were central to the Rat Pack's success, though their relationship eventually cooled due to personal differences. Despite this, their legacy as entertainers continues to inspire new generations of musicians and actors. Sinatra passed away on May 14, 1998, while Martin died on December 25, 1995. Their musical style, which blended swing, big band, and adult standards, remains timeless and influential in the music industry. The genres they worked in, such as Christmas and swing music, are still popular today, reflecting their enduring impact on popular culture.
