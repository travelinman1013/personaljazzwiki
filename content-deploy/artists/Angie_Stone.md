## Biography
Angela Laverne Stone (née Brown), known professionally as Angie Stone, was born on December 18, 1961, in Columbia, South Carolina. Raised in a gospel-rich environment, Stone’s earliest musical experiences came from singing in her church, which deeply influenced her vocal style and emotional delivery. Her professional journey began in 1979 as Angie B., a member of The Sequence, one of the first female hip-hop acts, marking her as a pioneer in the genre[1]. In the early 1990s, Stone transitioned to R&B and neo-soul, joining the group Vertical Hold, where she honed her harmonization and songwriting skills[3]. She also worked as a background vocalist and saxophonist for artists like Lenny Kravitz and contributed to D’Angelo’s debut album, Brown Sugar[1][2].

Stone’s solo career took off with the release of Black Diamond (1999), which showcased her blend of classic soul, R&B, and contemporary neo-soul. The album’s success, especially the hit “No More Rain (In This Cloud),” established her as a leading voice in neo-soul[2][3]. Subsequent albums, including Mahogany Soul (2001) and Stone Love (2004), further solidified her reputation, with tracks like “Wish I Didn’t Miss You” becoming genre staples. Despite health challenges, including sarcoidosis, Stone continued to record and perform, earning multiple Grammy nominations and industry awards[3].

Angie Stone’s musical style is characterized by her rich, emotive vocals, gospel-infused melodies, and honest lyricism. She played a significant role in shaping the neo-soul movement, both as a performer and songwriter, influencing a generation of artists with her authenticity and versatility. Her legacy includes not only her own recordings but also her contributions to the works of other major artists, making her a respected figure in contemporary soul and R&B[1][2].
