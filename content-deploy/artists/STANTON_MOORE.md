## Biography
Stanton Moore is a GRAMMY Award-winning drummer, educator, and performer born and raised in New Orleans, Louisiana, a city whose vibrant musical heritage profoundly shaped his artistic identity[1][2][3]. Growing up immersed in the sounds of Mardi Gras parades and the rich traditions of local legends like Professor Longhair, Dr. John, and the Meters, Moore began drumming at a young age and was deeply influenced by the city’s collaborative, groove-centric culture[2][3]. He earned a bachelor’s degree in music and business from Loyola University, balancing academic study with active participation in New Orleans’ thriving music scene[1][2]. In the early 1990s, Moore co-founded Galactic, a progressive jazz-funk band that quickly gained acclaim and continues to tour globally, averaging around 100 shows per year for over two decades[1][2][4].

Moore launched his solo career in 1998 with the album All Kooked Out!, showcasing his versatility and deep roots in New Orleans funk, jazz, and R&B[1][2]. Over a 25-year career, he has released nine solo albums, including the recent With You In Mind: The Songs of Allen Toussaint, and has collaborated with a diverse array of artists across genres, from Maceo Parker and Irma Thomas to Tom Morello and Corrosion of Conformity[1][4]. Moore is equally recognized as an educator, having authored influential instructional books like Groove Alchemy and created the Groove Academy video series, while also teaching clinics and masterclasses worldwide[1][3]. His musical style is marked by a mastery of the New Orleans second-line groove, inventive improvisation, and a seamless blend of jazz, funk, and rock influences, cementing his legacy as a torchbearer for the city’s rhythmic traditions[1][5].
