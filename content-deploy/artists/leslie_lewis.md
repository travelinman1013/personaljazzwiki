## Biography
Leslee Peter Lewis, popularly known as Lezz Lewis, was born on June 20, 1960, in Mumbai, India, into a family deeply rooted in the performing arts.[1][2] His father, P. L. Raj, was a renowned choreographer in Bollywood during the 1960s, and his mother, Devyani, was a dancer, providing him with a rich musical and artistic environment from birth.[2] Lewis pursued formal education at St. Mary's High School in Mt. Abu, Rajasthan, and later attended Catherine College in Mumbai, though he chose to focus on his musical career rather than complete his degree.[2]

Lewis's professional journey began in 1987 when he launched a music company and started composing advertising jingles for leading television networks.[1][3] His work in this field earned him nominations from the Indian Academy of Advertising Film Art (IAAFA), and in 1989, he received an award for his contributions.[1][2] He created iconic jingles for major brands including Doodh-Doodh-Doodh (Piyo full glass), Mango Fruity, Thums Up, and Santoor, establishing himself as a versatile composer.[1] His mainstream music career expanded significantly when he remixed Asha Bhosle's album *Rahul and I* and composed music for various artists including Suneeta Rao's *Paree Hu Main* (1991), Alisha Chinai's *Bombay Girl* (1994), and KK's album *Pal* (1999).[1][2]

The defining moment of Lewis's career came in 1996 when he formed the fusion duo Colonial Cousins with ghazal singer Hariharan.[1][2] Their self-titled debut album achieved unprecedented success, winning both the MTV Asia Viewers' Choice Award and the U.S. Billboard Viewers' Choice Award, making them the first Indian duo to be featured on MTV Unplugged.[1][2] The duo released subsequent albums including *The Way We Do It* (1998) and *Aatma* (2001), solidifying their place in Indian music history.[1] Beyond his work with Colonial Cousins, Lewis released his first solo album *Haseena* in 1998 and composed scores for Hindi films *Mela* and *Jahd*, as well as Tamil films *Modhi Vilayadu* and *Chikku Bukku*.[1][2] In 2011, Lewis conceived and created all the music for Coke Studio India's debut season, establishing himself as a torchbearer for independent Indian music.[1][2] His contributions to music have been recognized with numerous awards, including doctorates in music from the National Institute of Education Research and National American University (both 2019), the Global Music Icon Award (2021), and the Maestro Award from Whistling Woods International (2023).[2]

## Fun Facts
- Lewis met Hariharan in 1992 for a jingle project, and during a casual rehearsal session, Hariharan spontaneously proposed the idea of forming a duo that would blend Indian classical singing with rock and pop music, leading to the formation of Colonial Cousins.[2]
- Colonial Cousins was the first Indian duo to be featured on MTV Unplugged, marking a significant milestone in Indian music history.[1]
- Lewis was initially reluctant to pursue film music composition despite his father's encouragement, as he was a stickler for quality and feared having to compromise artistic standards in the film industry.[3]
- Lewis has been honored as the 'Godfather of Independent Music' by the World Peace Summit and serves as the mascot for IIMUN (India's International Movement to Unite Nations).[2]
