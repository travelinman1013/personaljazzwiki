## Biography
The Commoners are a roots/blues rock band formed in Toronto, Canada, evolving over the course of a decade through numerous obstacles into their current lineup. Hailing from areas including Toronto, Hamilton, and St. Thomas in Ontario, the band blends high-energy riffs, soulful vocals, and rich harmonies to deliver an authentic Southern-style rock experience inspired by the dusty back roads of rural Ontario and the bright lights of the city.[1][5] Their sound, described as tapped from the oaken belly of a whiskey barrel, fuses classic rock, southern blues, and roots music, earning them recognition in the modern blues rock scene with Spotify genres including blues rock, southern rock, and modern blues.[1][2]

The core four-piece consists of Chris Medhurst on lead vocals and rhythm guitar, Ross Hayes Citrullo on lead guitar, Ben Spiller on bass (also vocals and piano), and Adam Cannon on drums and percussion, often joined by organist Miles Evans-Branagh, making them a five-piece roots/rock outfit.[1][4] They have released albums such as 'Find A Better Way' in 2022 on Gypsy Soul Records, produced and mixed at RHC Music in Toronto by Citrullo with executive producer Renan Yildizdogan, and later 'Restless' in 2024, showcasing their development with high praise for tracks blending soul, blues, and southern rock.[1][2][6] The band aspires to honor the greats while creating original music that marries old and new southern rock with Canadian roots.[1]

Influenced by acts like The Black Crowes, Derek Trucks, Marcus King, Led Zeppelin, and The Allman Brothers Band, The Commoners are known for intense vocals, formidable guitar work, and masterful shifts between heaviness and soft textures, as evident in critically acclaimed albums that tackle modern-day struggles through compelling compositions.[1][2]
