## Biography
Alex de Grassi was born on February 13, 1952, in Yokosuka, Japan, and was raised in San Francisco, California, in a deeply musical family where his grandfather played violin professionally for the San Francisco Symphony. He initially pursued trumpet as his first instrument but made a pivotal decision at age 13 to switch to guitar, a choice that would define his artistic career. Though largely self-taught as a guitarist, de Grassi studied jazz guitar with noted teacher Bill Thrasher at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and later pursued classical guitar studies, jazz piano with Bay Area musician Mark Levine, and composition with renowned teacher William A. Mathieu. His early performances as a street musician in London and university coffeehouse performances evolved into a distinguished career spanning over 40 years, establishing him as one of America's foremost steel-string fingerstyle guitarists.

De Grassi's musical style synthesizes folk, neo-classical, jazz, and world music elements through an innovative approach to composing and arranging for solo steel-string guitar. His technique is characterized by intricate finger-picking, cross-rhythms, dazzling arpeggios, and ringing harmonics that create a highly orchestrated canvas of sound. His 1978 debut album "Turning: Turning Back" (Windham Hill) was cited by Acoustic Guitar magazine among their top ten essential fingerstyle recordings, followed by influential works including "Slow Circle" (1979), "Clockwork" (1981), and "Southern Exposure" (1984). His 1998 album "The Water Garden" received a Grammy nomination and an Indie Award nomination, earning recognition as Crossroads Magazine's Best Acoustic Instrumental Recording of the year. The Wall Street Journal has called his playing "flawless," while Billboard praised his "intricate finger-picking technique with an uncanny gift for melodic invention."

Beyond his solo career, de Grassi has established himself as a versatile collaborator and composer. He has performed at prestigious venues including Carnegie Hall, the Kennedy Center, Montreux Jazz Festival, and numerous international festivals across Europe, Latin America, Japan, and North America. His collaborative projects include "Bolivian Blues Bar" (1999), exploring jazz interpretations; "Tatamonk" with Chilean folk musician Quique Cruz; and the deMania trio with bassist Michael Manring and percussionist Chris Garcia (formed 2006). He has also composed for television, including the series "Americas," and was featured in a PBS concert/interview television show titled "Alex de Grassi: The Artist's Profile." In 2006, he premiered an original concerto for steel-string guitar, string quartet, and string orchestra with Quartet San Francisco leader Jeremy Cohen, commissioned by String Letter Publishing. His legacy as an innovator in contemporary fingerstyle guitar has influenced generations of players and helped establish the foundation for modern acoustic guitar composition.
