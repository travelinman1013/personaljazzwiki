## Biography
Abbey Lincoln, born Anna Marie Wooldridge on August 6, 1930, in Chicago, Illinois, was a renowned American jazz vocalist, songwriter, and actress. She was raised in Calvin Center, Michigan, and began her professional singing career in Los Angeles and Honolulu under various stage names before settling on Abbey Lincoln in 1956. Her debut album, *Abbey Lincoln's Affair... A Story of a Girl in Love*, marked the beginning of a distinguished career. Lincoln's music was deeply influenced by her involvement in the civil rights movement, particularly evident in her work with Max Roach on *We Insist Freedom Now Suite* (1960), a landmark protest album. She continued to explore themes of identity and social justice throughout her career. In the 1990s, Lincoln experienced a resurgence in popularity, signing with Verve Records and releasing a series of critically acclaimed albums. Her legacy as a pioneering jazz vocalist and civil rights activist remains profound. Lincoln passed away on August 14, 2010, in New York City. Her later years were marked by philosophical songwriting and continued collaboration with top jazz artists. Lincoln's impact on jazz extends beyond her music, as she paved the way for future generations of vocalists with her unique style and activism.
