## Biography
C. J. Chenier, born Clayton Joseph Thompson on September 28, 1957, in Port Arthur, Texas, is the son of the legendary 'King of Zydeco,' Clifton Chenier. Growing up in the housing projects of Port Arthur, C.J. was initially more influenced by the soul, funk, and jazz of the 1970s—artists like James Brown, Funkadelic, John Coltrane, and Miles Davis—than by his father's zydeco music. He first learned to play the saxophone, performing in local Top 40 bands as a teenager, and later studied music at Texas Southern University[2][3][4].

C.J.'s entry into zydeco came when his father invited him to join the Red Hot Louisiana Band, first on saxophone and later, as Clifton's health declined, on accordion. After Clifton's death in 1987, C.J. inherited both the band and his father's accordion, quickly establishing himself as a leading figure in zydeco. He has since released multiple acclaimed albums, performed at major festivals such as the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival and the Chicago Blues Festival, and collaborated with artists like Paul Simon and the Gin Blossoms. C.J. is celebrated for blending traditional zydeco with contemporary influences, infusing the genre with new energy while honoring its roots[1][2][3][4].

Known for his dynamic stage presence and soulful vocals, C.J. Chenier has been called 'the best living zydeco singer and accordionist' and 'the heir to the zydeco throne.' His work with the Red Hot Louisiana Band has garnered critical acclaim, including a Grammy nomination for the album 'Can’t Sit Down.' C.J.'s legacy lies in his ability to bridge generations of zydeco, keeping the tradition alive while pushing its boundaries[1][2][3][4].

## Fun Facts
- C.J. Chenier did not initially appreciate zydeco and thought all his father's songs sounded the same until he began playing the music himself[2].
- His first instrument was the saxophone, not the accordion for which he is now famous[2][3].
- He was handpicked by Paul Simon to play on the album 'The Rhythm of the Saints' and to join Simon's world tour[2][4].
- C.J.'s first gig with his father's band was at the opening of Antone's, the iconic blues club in Austin, Texas[4].
