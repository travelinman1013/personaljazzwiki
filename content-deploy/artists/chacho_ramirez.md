## Biography
Berardo “Chacho” Ramirez is a New York City-born drummer, composer, and bandleader of Cuban and Puerto Rican descent. Born in 1951, Chacho began his musical journey at age 12, improvising drum kits from grocery store boxes due to his parents’ reluctance to buy him a set. Despite early challenges, his passion for rhythm and percussion drove him to pursue music seriously, eventually acquiring a drum set and honing his craft through persistent practice—even when it meant being chased from rehearsal spaces in his neighborhood.[2]

Chacho’s career developed through formal and informal study with prominent drummers, including Ian Finkel (Xavier Cugat Band), Steve Barrios (Mongo Santamaria, Fort Apache Band), Freddie Waits (McCoy Tyner, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye), and Pablo Rieppi (Columbia University, Hofstra University). He became known for blending Latin jazz with Afro-beat influences, leading his own ensemble, MetroTang. The group debuted at the Narrowsburg JazzFest in 2006 and released the album “Lights Out,” which features original compositions and works by Paquito d’Rivera and Bobby Martone. Critics have praised Chacho for creating a contemporary sound that reflects the cultural diversity of modern jazz.[2][4]

Beyond performance, Chacho Ramirez has contributed to the jazz community as an educator, teaching workshops, drum clinics, and master classes alongside legendary figures such as Max Roach, Alan Dawson, Joe Morello, Bernard Purdie, and Jim Chapin. His legacy lies in his innovative approach to Latin percussion, his commitment to education, and his role in shaping the sound of Latin jazz in New York and beyond.[2][4]
