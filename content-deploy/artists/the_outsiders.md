## Biography
The Outsiders were an American rock and roll and blue‑eyed soul band from Cleveland, Ohio, best known for their 1966 hit single "Time Won't Let Me."[2][6] The group evolved out of an earlier band, Tom King and the Starfires, which had been active on the Cleveland scene since around 1958, playing R&B‑leaning rock on local labels, including Pama Records run by founder Tom King's uncle.[2][3][6] After guitarist and bandleader Tom King co‑wrote "Time Won't Let Me" with his brother‑in‑law Chet Kelley in 1965, the recording attracted the attention of Capitol Records, which signed the band and insisted on a new, more contemporary name; the Starfires were reborn as The Outsiders in early 1966.[2][3] The classic mid‑1960s lineup included Tom King (guitar), Sonny Geraci (lead vocals), Mert Madsen (bass), Al Austin (lead guitar), and Ronnie Harkai (drums), with drummer Jimmy Fox briefly returning from college to play on sessions for the debut album.[2][3][6]

“Time Won’t Let Me” reached No. 5 on the U.S. charts in April 1966 and established The Outsiders nationally, leading to a run of three additional Hot 100 Top 40 singles that year and a total of four Capitol albums in the mid‑1960s.[2][4] Stylistically, the band combined Merseybeat‑style rock with Motown and soul influences, adding brass and horn arrangements to a garage‑rock foundation, an approach often described as blue‑eyed soul and noted as relatively sophisticated for the era.[2][3][4] Their song "Lonely Man" was later bootlegged in the U.K. and miscredited to a Northern soul act, evidence of how closely their sound paralleled emerging Northern soul tastes.[2] Although their chart success was short‑lived and they largely disappeared from national prominence after the 1960s, members and associates remained active: Jimmy Fox went on to form the James Gang, Sonny Geraci later fronted Climax, and Geraci periodically toured under variations of The Outsiders’ name during the oldies revival circuit decades later, keeping the band’s legacy alive among garage rock, Northern soul, and 1960s pop collectors.[2][3][4]

Their lasting reputation today rests on their blend of garage rock energy and soul‑inflected arrangements—an approach that anticipated the horn‑driven Chicago sound later associated with bands like the Buckinghams and Chicago—and on the enduring popularity of "Time Won't Let Me" as a staple of 1960s rock anthologies.[2][4] Collectors and historians often highlight the group as one of the earliest white American bands to internalize and reinterpret Motown and soul idioms within a rock context, giving The Outsiders a small but distinct place in the evolution of American pop and Northern soul culture.[2][4] Their work continues to appear on reissues and genre compilations, solidifying their status as a cult favorite rather than a one‑hit curiosity.

Note: Multiple bands have used the name "The Outsiders"; this biography refers specifically to the American rock band from Cleveland, Ohio, best known for "Time Won't Let Me."[1][2]

## Fun Facts
- "Time Won’t Let Me" was originally cut while the band was still called Tom King and the Starfires; Capitol Records demanded a new name before releasing the song nationally, leading directly to the birth of The Outsiders.[2][3]
- The formative version of the band dates back to around 1958 in Cleveland, making The Outsiders’ core musicians veterans with nearly a decade of experience by the time they scored their 1966 Top 5 hit.[2][3][6]
- Their song "Lonely Man" became a cult item in the UK Northern soul scene after being bootlegged, retitled "Help Me Find My Way," and wrongly credited to a non‑existent Detroit Shakers group.[2]
- Future James Gang founder Jimmy Fox briefly left college to rejoin his old bandmates and drum on The Outsiders’ debut album sessions—work that helped convince him to abandon school and pursue a full‑time music career.[2][3][4]
