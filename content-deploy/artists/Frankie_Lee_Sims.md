## Biography
Frankie Lee Sims was born on April 30, 1917, in New Orleans, Louisiana, though he spent much of his childhood in Marshall, Texas after his family relocated there in the late 1920s. He learned guitar at age 12 from blues musician Little Hat Jones and soon began performing at local dances and parties. Sims balanced music with work as a teacher in Palestine, Texas during the late 1930s, but his career was interrupted by service in the Marine Corps during World War II. After the war, he settled in Dallas and devoted himself fully to music, quickly becoming a fixture in the Texas blues scene.[2][5]

Sims made his recording debut in 1947, backing Smokey Hogg, and released his first singles under his own name in 1948 for Blue Bonnet Records. His breakthrough came in 1953 with the regional hit "Lucy Mae Blues" for Specialty Records, a song praised for its rhythmic energy and humor. Sims developed a distinctive electric guitar style characterized by twangy, ringing tones and infectious dance rhythms, which became influential in postwar Texas country blues. He continued recording through the 1950s for labels like Ace and Vin, working with a small band and further refining his rocking sound, though his commercial success waned after his initial hit. Sims died in Dallas on May 10, 1970, but his recordings and style have left a lasting mark on the blues genre.[2][4][5]

Sims is recognized as a key figure in Texas country blues, alongside his cousin Lightnin' Hopkins and contemporaries like Lil' Son Jackson. His music bridged traditional fingerstyle blues and the emerging electric styles of the postwar era, and he played a significant role in mentoring and influencing younger musicians in the Dallas scene.[5]
