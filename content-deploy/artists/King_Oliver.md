## Biography
Joseph 'King' Oliver was born on December 19, 1885, in Aben, near Donaldsonville, Louisiana, and grew up immersed in the vibrant brass band culture of New Orleans during an era of racial segregation[1][5]. He began his career playing cornet in bands such as the Eagle Band and Magnolia Band, quickly establishing himself as a leading figure in the city's musical scene. By the 1910s, Oliver was co-leading one of New Orleans' hottest bands with Kid Ory and was in high demand for performances across both Black and white communities[7].

In 1919, Oliver left New Orleans for Chicago, motivated by increasing racism and the closure of Storyville, the city's famed red-light district[3][5]. He worked with bands led by Lawrence Duhe and Bill Johnson before forming his own group, King Oliver’s Creole Jazz Band. The band, featuring notable musicians like Johnny Dodds, Honore Dutrey, Lil Hardin, and later Louis Armstrong, became a cornerstone of early jazz, performing at venues such as the Lincoln Gardens and recording some of the first significant African American New Orleans jazz records[1][3][6]. Oliver was renowned for his innovative 'talking' horn technique and ensemble-based approach, which helped elevate jazz from its regional roots to national prominence[5].

Despite his early successes, Oliver's career declined during the Great Depression, exacerbated by health issues and changing musical tastes favoring big band arrangements over polyphonic jazz[5][6]. He died in poverty in Savannah, Georgia, in 1938, but his legacy endures through his profound influence on jazz, especially as a mentor to Louis Armstrong and as a pioneer of ensemble jazz performance[1][5].

## Fun Facts
- King Oliver gained his lifelong nickname after winning cornet battles against Freddie Keppard and Manuel Perez[3].
- He was one of the first jazz musicians to use mutes creatively, producing the 'wah-wah' effect that became a hallmark of early jazz[1][5].
- Oliver turned down an offer to play at Harlem’s Cotton Club, a gig that instead went to Duke Ellington, helping launch Ellington’s career[5].
- In his final years, Oliver suffered from gum disease that ended his ability to play the cornet, and he died in poverty while working as a pool hall janitor in Savannah, Georgia[6].
