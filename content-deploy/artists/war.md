# WAR

## Quick Info
- **Genres**: neofolk, ambient folk, celtic, medieval, folk metal
- **Spotify Popularity**: 57/100
- **Followers**: 785,561
- **Origin**: Long Beach

## Biography
The artist credited on Spotify simply as **WAR** in the neofolk / ambient folk / Celtic / medieval / folk metal space does not correspond to a clearly documented, distinct musician or project under that exact name in reliable English‑language sources. Searches across music databases, press coverage, scene histories (including overviews of neofolk and related genres), and general web sources turn up no verifiable biography for a neofolk or folk‑metal artist called “WAR” that matches the listed genres and popularity profile. Instead, results are dominated either by the well‑known 1970s US funk band WAR, unrelated to these genres, or by general discussions of neofolk and adjacent scenes without mention of an artist named WAR as an individual or group within this style.[3][4][6]

Because of this, any attempt to provide a narrative about early life, career development, musical style, and legacy for a neofolk/folk‑metal artist named WAR would be speculative and not grounded in credible sources. All available, reputable material on neofolk history and key figures (such as Tony Wakeford, Douglas P. of Death in June, and David Tibet of Current 93) does not list WAR among foundational or prominent acts, nor do genre‑focused critical essays, antifascist neofolk resources, or academic treatments of the scene.[3][4][6] Without primary interviews, label notes, press releases, or reliable database entries specifically tied to this artist name and genre profile, a comprehensive biographical account cannot be produced to the standard of verification you requested.

If “WAR” on Spotify is an alias of a better‑known musician, a very small independent project, or a mis‑tag of another artist entirely, that information is not yet documented in the publicly accessible, reputable sources surveyed here. For accurate biographical details, the best next steps would be to consult the project’s official channels (artist website, Bandcamp, label page, or social media) and any credits visible directly on Spotify or in release liner notes, none of which are available or reliably mirrored in the open web sources used for this research.

## Fun Facts
- There is currently no verifiable, published background information about a neofolk / folk‑metal artist named WAR that matches the Spotify genre profile you provided; most search results instead reference the unrelated 1970s funk band WAR or general discussions of neofolk.
- Key historical overviews of neofolk and related styles name foundational artists such as Tony Wakeford, Douglas Pearce (Death in June), and David Tibet (Current 93), but do not list an artist called WAR among notable acts in the scene.[3][4][6]
- Because of the absence of reliable coverage, it is possible that WAR as tagged on Spotify is a very small, self‑released project, a secondary alias of another artist, or a metadata conflation with a different act; none of these possibilities can be confirmed from current open‑web sources.
