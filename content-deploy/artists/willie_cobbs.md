## Biography
Willie Cobbs (July 15, 1932 – October 25, 2021) was an influential American blues singer, harmonica player, and songwriter, best known for penning the classic 'You Don't Love Me.' Born in Smale, Monroe County, Arkansas, Cobbs grew up surrounded by gospel music and received harmonicas from his father each Christmas, but only began playing blues seriously after moving to Chicago in the late 1940s. There, he immersed himself in the vibrant club scene, performing with notable musicians such as Little Walter and Eddie Boyd, and honing his craft on Maxwell Street, a legendary blues hub.[1][3][6]

Cobbs' career took off in 1960 with the recording of 'You Don't Love Me,' a song that would become a blues standard and be covered by a wide array of artists across genres, including the Allman Brothers Band, Junior Wells, and Dawn Penn, whose reggae version became an international hit decades later. Despite never achieving the same commercial success with subsequent singles, Cobbs remained a respected figure in the blues community, recording for various labels, running nightclubs in Arkansas and Mississippi, and performing at major festivals such as the King Biscuit Blues Festival and the Chicago Blues Festival. His later years saw him release albums like 'Down to Earth' and 'Jukin',' and he continued to perform and record well into his eighties, cementing his legacy as a vital link in the evolution of blues music.[1][2][3]

Cobbs' musical style was rooted in classic blues, characterized by his expressive harmonica playing and soulful vocals. His songwriting often reflected the struggles and wit of everyday life, as seen in his response to James Brown's 'Say It Loud – I'm Black and I'm Proud' with his own 'Sing It Low – I'm Black and I'm Poor.' Cobbs' enduring influence is evident in the many artists who have drawn from his work, ensuring his place in the annals of American music history.[1][2][3]
