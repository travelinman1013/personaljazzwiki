## Biography
Timbalada is an Afro‑Brazilian percussion and vocal group formed in 1991 in the Candeal neighborhood of Salvador, Bahia, Brazil, by drummer, singer and songwriter Carlinhos Brown together with composer‑percussionist Tony Mola.[1][6] Emerging from Bahia’s vibrant carnival culture and community music projects, the ensemble brought together dozens of percussionists—often youths from the neighborhood—alongside singers and dancers, using body paint and striking visual aesthetics as part of its identity.[1][2] Their sound fuses samba‑reggae and axé with strong African rhythmic influences, powered by large drum sections and call‑and‑response vocals, helping to project the music of Candeal and Salvador to national and international stages.[1][2]

Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Timbalada became one of the most popular carnival groups in Salvador, performing in bloco format during Brazilian Carnival and regularly selling out concerts across Brazil.[1][2] The group toured internationally, appearing at festivals such as the Montreux Jazz Festival, Holland Festival, and Montreal International Jazz Festival, and released a series of albums including “Mineral,” which won a Sharp Award in Brazil.[1] Musically they are credited with reviving the nearly extinct timbal (a tall, high‑pitched hand drum) and developing an innovative rack of three surdos playable by a single musician, innovations that subsequently spread throughout axé and samba‑reggae ensembles.[1][2] Beyond performance, Timbalada has maintained a strong social mission, offering education and drumming courses to children and young people from low‑income communities as a tool for social integration and cultural empowerment.[1][2] Their mix of musical innovation, community work, and carnival presence has made them a reference point within contemporary Afro‑Bahian music.

Over time, Timbalada has also served as an artistic laboratory and springboard for numerous Bahian musicians, particularly vocalists who began their careers with the group before pursuing solo paths.[4] The project’s blend of traditional Afro‑Bahian percussion, modern pop and axé arrangements, and theatrical performance has influenced the broader sound and visual language of Bahian carnival groups and pagode baiano‑adjacent acts, reinforcing Salvador’s reputation as a center of rhythmic experimentation.[1][2][3] Today, Timbalada continues to perform and record, sustaining its role as both a carnival powerhouse and a community‑rooted cultural institution that celebrates Afro‑Brazilian identity through rhythm, dance, and collective music‑making.[1][2][6]

## Fun Facts
- Timbalada is visually distinctive for performing with tribal‑style body paint and often sunglasses, making their percussion corps as visually striking as their sound.[2]
- The group helped rescue the timbal drum from near extinction; after Timbalada popularized it, the instrument became common across axé and samba‑reggae bands in Bahia.[1][2]
- Beyond music, Timbalada runs social projects in Candeal that provide drumming and educational programs for children and teenagers, using music as a tool for social inclusion.[1][2]
- Timbalada has taken Bahian carnival rhythms to major international stages, including performances at the Montreux Jazz Festival, Holland Festival and Montreal International Jazz Festival.[1]

## Musical Connections

### Mentors/Influences
- [[carlinhos_brown|Carlinhos Brown]] - Founder, musical director and primary creative force behind Timbalada; his background in Bahia’s samba‑reggae and Afro‑Brazilian popular music traditions shaped the group’s concept, repertoire and community focus. (Founding and directing the group; albums such as “Mineral” and other Timbalada releases where he contributed as composer, percussionist and singer.) [1991–present]

### Key Collaborators
- [[tony_mola|Tony Mola]] - Co‑founder, composer and percussionist who helped design Timbalada’s early percussion arrangements and overall sound alongside Carlinhos Brown. (Early Timbalada projects and live ensembles in the 1990s, including work that led to albums like “Mineral.”) [Early 1990s–mid 1990s[1]]
- [[gustavo_di_dalva|Gustavo di Dalva]] - Percussionist and long‑standing band member, part of the core drum section that defines Timbalada’s live and recorded sound. (Participation in Timbalada’s stage shows and recordings as a principal percussionist.) [1991–present[2]]

### Artists Influenced
- [[mariene_de_castro|Mariene de Castro]] - Bahian singer who was a member of Carlinhos Brown’s Timbalada group early in her career; the experience with Timbalada’s Afro‑Bahian samba and axé aesthetics helped shape her artistic identity before her solo work. (Early performances with Timbalada prior to her solo debut “Abre Caminho”; later live shows and recordings that retain Afro‑Bahian rhythmic elements associated with the group.) [Mid‑1990s onward[4]]
- [[afrobahian_axé_and_sambareggae_percussion_ensembles|Afro‑Bahian axé and samba‑reggae percussion ensembles]] - Timbalada’s revival of the timbal and the innovation of the three‑surdos rack influenced instrumentation and staging practices for many axé and samba‑reggae groups in Bahia and beyond. (Subsequent carnival blocos and stage bands across Salvador that adopted expanded timbal sections and similar surdo rack setups.) [Mid‑1990s–present[1][2]]
