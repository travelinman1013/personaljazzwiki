## Biography
Alysha Brilla is an Indo-Tanzanian Canadian singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, music producer, and composer known for blending folk, world, and soul influences into her work[1][4]. Born in Mwanza, Tanzania, and raised in Dar Es Salaam before moving to Toronto, Brilla grew up in a multicultural household with her father of Tanzanian-Indian descent and her mother Canadian[6][7]. This diverse background deeply informs her music, which often explores themes of identity, belonging, and social justice.

Brilla's career has been marked by her independent spirit and commitment to self-production. She is a three-time JUNO Award-nominated artist, recognized for her songwriting, production, and performance talents[2][3]. Her sound is shaped by Toronto's vibrant Caribbean community and global roots music, weaving together elements from her heritage and her experiences in Canada[5]. Brilla is also a touring multi-instrumentalist and audio engineer, frequently engaging in collaborations and educational work.

As a queer woman of color, Brilla has become a prominent voice for inclusivity and empowerment in the music industry. Her legacy includes not only her critically acclaimed albums and performances but also her advocacy for underrepresented artists and her efforts to mentor the next generation of musicians.
