## Biography
waterbaby & ttoh represents a collaboration between Stockholm-based artist waterbaby (the musical moniker of 24-year-old Kendra Egerbladh) and rapper ttoh. waterbaby grew up in Stockholm's suburbs, deeply influenced by her great-grandfather who was a jazz pianist, and her uncle who worked in clubs and arranged concerts. This musical heritage became embedded in her artistic DNA from an early age. She developed her craft through a choir-school upbringing that shaped her distinctive vocal approach, characterized by delicate, spare melodic ideas with spiritual depth. Her early musical tastes—particularly R&B artists whom she revered as paragons of emotional expression—contrasted sharply with her parents' preferences, driving her to develop a deeply personal artistic vision.

waterbaby's rise began with her Sub Pop debut EP 'Foam,' which featured introspective crush songs blending confessional lyrics with guitar-assisted warmth and auto-tuned vocals. The collaboration with ttoh on 'Beck n Call' (released November 2025) marks a significant sonic evolution in her indie-pop sound, emerging two years after previous releases. Co-written by long-term collaborator Marcus White, the track showcases waterbaby's expansion into softer soundscapes while maintaining her signature micro-melodic tendencies. ttoh's contribution brings a woozy, offhand rap delivery that complements waterbaby's whispered vocals, creating a seamless blend of late 90s R&B textures with contemporary off-kilter rhythms. This collaboration demonstrates waterbaby's trajectory from underground bedroom-pop pioneer to one of Sweden's most exciting emotionally-attuned artists, with the partnership highlighting her ability to work across genres and with diverse vocal styles.

waterbaby has been nominated for 'Newcomer of the Year' at the 2024 Swedish Grammys and continues to establish herself within Sub Pop's eclectic roster. Her work is characterized by rumination on love, longing, and the psychological complexities of infatuation, with production that honors both the confessional and the experimental. The collaboration with ttoh on 'Beck n Call' represents her growing confidence in exploring lighter, more buoyant sonic territories while maintaining the emotional depth that defines her artistic identity.
