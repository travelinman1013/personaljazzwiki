## Biography
Melissa Etheridge, born May 29, 1961, in Leavenworth, Kansas, is an acclaimed American singer-songwriter and guitarist known for her powerful, raspy vocals and deeply personal songwriting. She began playing guitar at age eight and was performing in local bands by her teens. After a brief stint at Boston’s Berklee College of Music, Etheridge moved to Los Angeles, where she built a following playing in clubs, particularly within the lesbian bar circuit. Her talent was soon recognized by manager Bill Leopold and Island Records founder Chris Blackwell, leading to her signing with Island Records in 1986.

Etheridge’s self-titled debut album was released in 1988 and quickly became an underground success, earning her a Grammy nomination for the single "Bring Me Some Water." Her subsequent albums, including 'Brave and Crazy' (1989) and 'Never Enough' (1992), solidified her reputation as a leading figure in American rock. Her commercial breakthrough came with 'Yes I Am' (1993), featuring hits like "I'm the Only One" and "Come to My Window," the latter earning her a second Grammy Award. Etheridge’s confessional lyrics and blues-rock style resonated with audiences, and she became known for her openness about her sexuality at a time when few mainstream artists were out. Her career has been marked by resilience, including a public battle with breast cancer and a triumphant return to the stage.

Over more than three decades, Etheridge has released numerous albums, won multiple Grammy Awards, and received an Academy Award for Best Original Song for "I Need to Wake Up" from the documentary 'An Inconvenient Truth.' Her legacy includes not only her musical achievements but also her advocacy for LGBTQ+ rights and cancer awareness, making her a significant cultural figure in American music.
