## Biography
Mervyn Edward "Merv" Griffin, Jr. (born July 6, 1925, San Mateo, California; died August 12, 2007, Los Angeles) was a multifaceted American entertainer whose career spanned singing, acting, television hosting, and media entrepreneurship. Raised in a Roman Catholic Irish-American family, Griffin began performing in his church choir and soon earned money as a church organist. He launched his professional career as a radio singer at age 19, later touring for four years with the Freddy Martin Orchestra. Griffin's breakout came with the 1950 novelty hit "I've Got a Lovely Bunch of Coconuts," which sold three million copies and propelled him into national fame as a recording artist and nightclub performer.

Transitioning to television, Griffin became a familiar face as a regular on variety programs before hosting his own talk show, "The Merv Griffin Show," which ran in various forms from 1962 to 1986 and won multiple Emmy Awards. He was also a prolific game show creator, most notably developing "Jeopardy!" and "Wheel of Fortune," two of the most enduring and popular syndicated television shows in history. Griffin's genial, unpretentious style as a host and his innovative approach to television production made him a beloved figure and a powerful force in American entertainment. His legacy endures through his game show creations and his influence on the talk show format.
