## Biography
Marvelous Funkshun is a Winston-Salem, North Carolina-based band formed in 2014 by guitarist and vocalist Sam Robinson, blending psychedelic rock, classic funk, electric blues, jam rock, and sacred steel elements into extended improvisational grooves.[1][2][3] The band's signature sound centers on the pedal steel guitar of Durell Randolph, nephew of sacred steel pioneer Robert Randolph, complemented by Will Bagley on bass, Zach Landon on drums, and Ian McIsaac on keyboards, creating a heavy, groove-oriented style that has made them a favorite at venues and festivals across the Southeast.[1][3][4] As veteran live performers, they have toured heavily since formation, sharing stages with major acts and releasing music like the 2023 EP *Instru-Mental*, which includes a cover of The Meters' 'Look-Ka Py Py'.[1][2]

Sam Robinson, a seasoned musician with a history of diverse gigs including Widespread Panic after-parties and local fundraisers, leads the group with hard-edged guitar work inspired by artists like Mark Lettieri, The Meters, Ghost-Note, and Eric Gales.[1][3] Recent singles such as 'Harris the Hater' (featuring Eric Gales and John 'Papa' Gros) and 'Stormy Weather' (with Gros) showcase their evolving sound, often born from spontaneous ideas like one conceived during Robinson's COVID recovery in 2020.[1][3][6] The band has built a reputation through consistent regional touring and high-profile supports, gearing up for events like Jazz Fest and collaborations with funk legends.[4][6]

Marvelous Funkshun's legacy lies in their fusion of sacred steel with funk and jam traditions, positioning them as one of North Carolina's rising underground acts with growing recognition through guest appearances and new releases.[1][3]
