## Biography
Daybreak (Korean: 데이브레이크) is a South Korean rock band formed in Seoul in 2007, known for their bright, melodic sound that blends elements of pop, rock, indie, and ballad styles.[6][1] They officially debuted on September 18, 2007 with the studio album “Urban Life Style,” which introduced their polished band sound and set the tone for a career built around optimistic, audience-friendly songwriting.[6][1] The group’s core lineup consists of vocalist Lee Won-seok, bassist Kim Sun-il, keyboardist Kim Jang-won, and guitarist Jung Yoo-jong (often romanized in different ways), and they quickly became associated with Korea’s modern indie band scene while maintaining accessible, radio-ready melodies.[1][6]

Across subsequent albums such as “Aurora” (2010), “SPACEenSUM” (2012) and later releases, Daybreak developed a reputation for genre-crossing arrangements and live performances that emphasize interaction with the crowd.[1] Their representative songs, frequently cited in Korean sources, include “좋다 (Good),” “들었다 놨다 (I Heard It / Pick Up and Put Down),” and “꽃길만 걷게 해줄게 (I’ll Only Let You Walk on the Flower Path),” tracks celebrated for their positive, romantic themes and singable hooks that appeal across generations and tastes.[1] Beyond records, Daybreak’s stature grew through appearances on the band survival show *Top Band 2* in 2012, a high‑profile performance at the Blue House in 2017, and vocalist Lee Won-seok’s notable five‑time winning streak on the TV program *King of Mask Singer*, which significantly broadened the band’s recognition with the general public.[1] Over time, they have come to be regarded in Korean media as a representative, still‑active band within the domestic live scene, particularly praised for their energetic concerts and strong frontman presence.[1]

In the 2010s and early 2020s, Daybreak continued to release music and engage in collaborations that underline their adaptable style.[1] They participated in major events such as the Blue Dragon Film Awards stage and promotional campaigns like SK Telecom’s “Cheering Song for You,” further cementing their image as purveyors of uplifting, feel‑good band music.[1] In 2021 they released the single “말이 안 되잖아 (It Doesn’t Make Sense)” featuring Heize, written with lyricist Kim Eana and producer Sang Yoon, a project that linked them more directly with the mainstream K‑pop and R&B world.[1] In 2022 they collaborated with younger band LUCY on a joint project that produced title tracks including “쉬운 답 (Easy Answer)” and “오에 (Oh-eh),” showing their continued influence on and connection to the newer generation of Korean bands.[1] After many years with indie label Happy Robot Records, Daybreak moved to Mystic Story in January 2024, signaling an ongoing, active chapter in a career now widely acknowledged as one of the most enduring and respected in Korea’s modern band scene.[1]

## Fun Facts
- Daybreak’s roots trace back to a prior band called Brunch, which debuted in 2005; Korean sources therefore sometimes describe Daybreak’s 2007 debut as effectively a re‑debut for the members.[1]
- The band is especially renowned in Korea for its live shows—frontman Lee Won-seok is often singled out for the way he playfully “controls” the audience, drawing big sing‑alongs and constant interaction throughout concerts.[1]
- Daybreak’s public profile rose sharply after a performance at South Korea’s Blue House in 2017, which led to invitations to major stages like the Blue Dragon Film Awards and events connected to the PyeongChang Winter Olympics torch relay.[1]
- Vocalist Lee Won-seok appeared on the TV show *King of Mask Singer* under the alias “Gulliver” and achieved five consecutive wins, which Korean media credit with significantly boosting Daybreak’s name recognition among the general public.[1]
