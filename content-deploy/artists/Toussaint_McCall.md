## Biography
Toussaint McCall (March 26, 1939 – August 7, 2023) was an American R&B singer and organist, best remembered for his soulful ballad "Nothing Takes the Place of You." Born in Delhi, Louisiana, McCall was raised in a large, musically inclined family; his father was a pastor and his mother was deeply enthusiastic about music. He attended Southern University in Baton Rouge after high school, developing his musical skills and drawing inspiration from the gospel traditions of his upbringing.

McCall's professional breakthrough came in the late 1960s after signing with Ronn Records in Shreveport, Louisiana. His 1967 single "Nothing Takes the Place of You" became a major hit, reaching #5 on the US R&B chart and #52 on the Billboard Hot 100. Although he released further singles and an album, none matched the success of his signature song. McCall continued to perform and record for local labels, maintaining a steady presence in the Southern soul scene. His music, characterized by smooth vocals and expressive organ playing, blended gospel, R&B, and the emerging northern soul style. In later years, McCall was honored with induction into the Northeast Louisiana Music Hall of Fame and made a cameo in the 1988 film "Hairspray," lip syncing to his classic hit.

McCall's legacy endures through the enduring popularity of "Nothing Takes the Place of You," which has been covered by artists across genres and generations.
