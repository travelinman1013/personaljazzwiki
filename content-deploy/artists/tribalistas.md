## Biography
Tribalistas is a Brazilian supergroup formed by three acclaimed artists: Marisa Monte, a prominent vocalist and composer from Rio de Janeiro; Carlinhos Brown, a Bahia-born percussionist known for honoring Afro-Brazilian roots through his group Timbalada; and Arnaldo Antunes, a São Paulo rocker and former frontman of the band Titãs. The trio came together in 2001 during sessions for Antunes' album *Paradeiro*, where Monte contributed vocals, sparking further collaborations via phone calls and meetings that resulted in 13 songs composed rapidly.[1][4] Their debut self-titled album, recorded in April 2002 at Monte's Rio de Janeiro studio and released on November 4, 2002, blended genres like pop, samba, bossa nova, and tropicália influences, evoking comparisons to Novos Baianos and achieving massive success with over 3.5 million copies sold worldwide, topping charts in Brazil and Portugal despite no live performances or interviews.[1][2][4]

The group's music marked a pivotal 'before-and-after' moment in Brazilian music, similar to tropicália or 1980s rock waves, with its 40-minute runtime praised for its effortless depth and homage to MPB (Música Popular Brasileira).[2][3] After the debut, members returned to solo careers—Monte raising a newborn, Brown producing for Timbalada, and Antunes continuing solo work—but stayed connected creatively.[2] They reunited sporadically, releasing 'Joga Arroz' in 2013 to support same-sex marriage and a second album in 2017 after composing new songs, solidifying their legacy as a transcendent, harmonious force in new MPB.[1][2]

Tribalistas' style fuses individual strengths—Monte's pop sophistication, Brown's rhythmic Afro-Brazilian pulse, and Antunes' poetic rock edge—creating intimate, tribal-sounding works that refreshed Brazilian music without mirroring any single member's prior output.[3][8]

## Fun Facts
- The album was recorded in just 17 days (April 8–24, 2002) at Marisa Monte's home studio in Rio de Janeiro, with only two additional musicians present.[4]
- Tribalistas promoted their 2002 debut with zero TV appearances or radio interviews, yet it sold over 3.5 million copies worldwide.[1][2]
- The name 'Tribalistas' derives from the prefix 'tri-' (for the trio) combined with 'tribal' from a Portuguese dictionary, evoking a tribe-like bond.[4]
- Their 2013 single 'Joga Arroz' was released specifically to support same-sex marriage in Brazil.[1]
