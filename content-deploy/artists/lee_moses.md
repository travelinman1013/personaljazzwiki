## Biography
Lee Moses was born in Atlanta, Georgia in 1941 and emerged as a powerful yet enigmatic figure in the world of soul, funk, and R&B. Growing up in Atlanta, he became a major presence in the local soul scene during the 1960s, known for his expressive vocals, innovative guitar work, and ability to blend raw emotion with gritty musicianship. Moses began his recording career in the mid-1960s, initially working as a session musician and performing in clubs. He moved to New York, where he played with a pre-fame Jimi Hendrix and became closely associated with producer Johnny Brantley, who helped him release a series of singles in 1967, including covers of 'My Adorable One,' 'Reach Out, I’ll Be There,' and 'Day Tripper.'[1][2][3]

In 1971, Moses released his only full-length album, 'Time and Place,' produced by Brantley and featuring members of The Ohio Players and his own band, The Deciples. The album showcased his signature style—a fusion of psychedelic soul, funk, and R&B, marked by scratchy guitar riffs and intense, heartfelt vocals. Despite its later status as a cult classic, 'Time and Place' was commercially unsuccessful at the time, leading Moses to leave New York, disillusioned with the music industry. He returned to Atlanta, where he continued to perform locally but struggled with depression and drug dependency. Moses died in Atlanta in 1997 at the age of 56, largely unheralded during his lifetime, but his work has since become highly sought after by collectors and admired by contemporary musicians.[1][2][3][6]

Moses’s legacy endures through his unique sound, which combined the emotional depth of Southern soul with the experimental edge of psychedelic rock. His music, though limited in recorded output, has influenced a new generation of artists and continues to be rediscovered by soul aficionados worldwide.
