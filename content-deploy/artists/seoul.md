## Biography
There is no widely recognized musical artist known as 'Seoul' in major music databases or encyclopedic sources. 'Seoul' is the capital city of South Korea and is frequently referenced in song titles, lyrics, and as a cultural backdrop in K-pop and Korean music, but it does not correspond to a specific, documented musical artist with a biography in the standard sense. As a result, there is no verifiable information about an individual or group named 'Seoul' with a defined early life, career development, musical style, or legacy in the global music industry. It is possible that the name refers to a local or emerging act, a stage name used in a limited context, or a misunderstanding of an artist’s name.
