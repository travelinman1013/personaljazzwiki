## Biography
Charley Crockett, born Matthew Charles Crockett on March 24, 1984, in San Benito, Texas, grew up in a trailer park in Los Fresnos raised by a single mother of Volga German descent, alongside an older brother and sister. His family later moved to Dallas, where he spent summers with his uncle in New Orleans' French Quarter, immersing himself in swamp pop, hot jazz, and Big Band tunes like those of Kueners. At 17, after leaving high school, his mother gifted him a pawn shop guitar, sparking his self-taught journey into songwriting and street performing in New Orleans' French Quarter, Dallas' Deep Ellum, and beyond.[1][2][4]

Crockett's itinerant career from 2001 to 2011 involved hitchhiking, freight train hopping, and busking across the U.S., including New York City where he formed the street band Trainrobbers, attracting a Sony Music representative who signed him to a management deal he later left. He worked on farms and communes in Northern California, lived on Paris streets for a year, and briefly in Spain and Morocco before returning to focus on music through blues jams in Dallas, Fort Worth, New Orleans, and Austin. Since 2015, he has released 15 studio albums, evolving from street busker to GRAMMY-nominated country star blending americana, outlaw country, alt-country, red dirt, honky-tonk, blues, and folk with a rebellious, authentic style rooted in his nomadic experiences.[1][2][5][6]

Crockett's legacy lies in his perseverance and defiance of mainstream paths, selling out major venues while staying true to raw, roots-driven sounds influenced by his street-honed ear and diverse travels, earning critical acclaim as a modern maverick in country music.[1][5]
