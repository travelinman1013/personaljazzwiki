## Biography
Charlie Dennard (born November 3, 1969) is an American keyboardist, composer, arranger, and bandleader known for blending New Orleans jazz, Brazilian music, and contemporary groove-based styles.[1][5] He grew up in the United States and later rooted his career in New Orleans, where he completed a Master’s degree in Music at the University of New Orleans in 1998, studying jazz performance and arranging in the city’s rich musical environment.[2][8] During this period he absorbed the traditions of modern New Orleans jazz and was mentored by influential pianist and educator Ellis Marsalis, deepening both his harmonic language and his sense of swing and lyricism.[3][8]

Over the last two decades, Dennard has performed extensively across the United States and internationally as both a sideman and bandleader, eventually becoming musical director for Cirque du Soleil’s touring productions, including a decade-long tenure that took him around the world.[1][4][6][7] His own recordings, such as "From Brazil to New Orleans" and "Deep Blue," showcase his command of piano and organ, marked by inventive, rhythmic, and soulful playing that draws on straight-ahead jazz, New Orleans funk, and Brazilian rhythmic concepts.[3][4][5][6] Reviewers have noted that his writing and arranging emphasize melodic clarity, rich chord voicings, and global influences, reflecting years spent collaborating with international artists and working in large-scale, theatrical musical settings.[4][5][6]

Dennard’s musical style is often described as multi-dimensional: at once firmly grounded in the jazz tradition and open to Latin, Brazilian, and world-music textures.[3][4][5][6] His work as a musical director and educator has given him a broader legacy beyond his own albums, as he has shaped the sound of touring ensembles, coached musicians in complex show environments, and helped bridge the aesthetics of jazz improvisation with the demands of contemporary production and stage performance.[4][6][7][8] Though not a mainstream household name, he is respected among peers and critics for his versatility, his refined keyboard technique, and his ability to integrate diverse musical cultures into a coherent personal voice.[3][4][5][6]
