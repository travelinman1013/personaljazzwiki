## Biography
Reuben 'Ruby' Braff was born on March 16, 1927, in Boston, Massachusetts, and became one of the most distinctive voices in jazz cornet and trumpet playing of the 20th century[1][3][6]. A self-taught musician, Braff began performing in Boston clubs as a teenager in the early 1940s, quickly establishing himself in the local jazz scene[1][2][3]. By the late 1940s and early 1950s, he was playing with established stars such as clarinetists Edmond Hall and Pee Wee Russell, and in 1953, he moved to New York City, where his inventive, lyrical style brought him work with both traditional and modern bands[1][3][5]. Braff’s career flourished in the 1950s and 1960s, including stints with Benny Goodman and as a member of George Wein’s Newport Jazz All-Stars, with whom he toured internationally[1][2].

Braff was renowned for his warm, expressive tone and melodic phrasing, drawing deeply from the swing tradition while incorporating subtle modern harmonic ideas[1][4]. Though he emerged after the Swing Era, his style was firmly rooted in the swing idiom, and he became a leading figure in the 'mainstream jazz' movement—a bridge between swing and bebop that featured both veterans and younger players[1][4]. Braff recorded 14 albums as a leader and many more as a sideman, working with artists like Scott Hamilton, Milt Hinton, Woody Herman, and Dave McKenna[1]. He continued performing and recording until his death on February 9, 2003, in Chatham, Massachusetts[1][2][4]. Braff’s legacy endures as a masterful interpreter of the Great American Songbook and a vital link in the continuum of jazz trumpet and cornet artistry.
