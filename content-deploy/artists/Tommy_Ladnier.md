## Biography
Tommy Ladnier (Thomas James Ladnier) was born on May 28, 1900, in Mandeville, Louisiana, a town just across Lake Pontchartrain from New Orleans, the cradle of jazz. He began his musical journey as a teenager, performing with the Independence Band at the Dew Drop Dance Hall in Mandeville. Trumpeter Bunk Johnson, a significant figure in early jazz, sometimes played with the band and gave Ladnier lessons, helping to shape his early technique and style[5][4][3]. In 1917, Ladnier moved with his mother to Chicago, where he initially worked in the stockyards before becoming a full-time musician. By the early 1920s, he was active in Chicago's vibrant jazz scene, performing with various groups and bandleaders, including Ollie Powers, Fate Marable, and King Oliver. His work with King Oliver in 1924-1925 was particularly formative, as Oliver's style greatly influenced Ladnier's own playing[1][2][8].

Ladnier's career quickly expanded internationally. He traveled to Europe with Sam Wooding's band in 1925, performing in major cities and joining the Louis Douglas Revue. Returning to New York in 1926, Ladnier became the principal trumpet soloist in Fletcher Henderson's orchestra, making several classic recordings and becoming one of the highest-paid musicians in New York at the time[1][2]. He continued to tour and record in Europe throughout the late 1920s, working with Benny Peyton, Noble Sissle, and leading his own group in Paris. In the early 1930s, Ladnier formed the New Orleans Feetwarmers with Sidney Bechet, performing in New Jersey and New York. He also ran a tailor shop with Bechet and led his own quintet in New Jersey, taught music in Connecticut, and performed around New York State. In 1938, he participated in historic recording sessions with Bechet and Mezz Mezzrow, organized by French jazz critic Hugues Panassié, and appeared at the famed "Spirituals to Swing" concert in New York in December 1938[1][2][5].

Ladnier's musical style evolved from early influences of King Oliver to a distinctive approach characterized by a symmetrical, songlike phrasing and an exceptional sense of swing, reminiscent of Louis Armstrong's early work. His playing was noted for its spirited yet relaxed quality, with a preference for contrapuntal interplay and a bold, expressive sound. French jazz historian Hugues Panassié rated Ladnier second only to Armstrong among jazz trumpeters. Despite his relatively short life—he died of a heart attack in Harlem, New York, on June 4, 1939—Ladnier left a lasting legacy as a key figure in the development of early jazz, admired for both his technical skill and his expressive artistry[5][1][3].
