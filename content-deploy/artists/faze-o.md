## Biography
Faze-O was a funk band formed in Dayton, Ohio, evolving from the earlier trio Faze 3, which included bassist Tyrone 'Flye' Crum as a consistent member. The group solidified into a five-piece lineup featuring Keith 'Chop Chop' Harrison on keyboards and lead vocals, Ralph 'Love' Aikens on guitar and vocals, Crum on bass, Robert 'Bip' Neal Jr. on percussion and lead vocals, and Roger 'Dodger' Parker on drums. They operated as a self-contained unit, collaboratively writing songs and refining arrangements to develop their signature smooth mid-tempo funk style with tight instrumental interplay, layered keyboards, and talk box effects.[1][2]

Produced by Clarence Satchell of the Ohio Players—for whom Faze-O served as the front band during live performances—the group released their debut album *Riding High* in 1977 on She Records. The title track became a major hit, peaking at No. 9 on the Billboard R&B chart and No. 98 on the Billboard 200, and has since been widely sampled in hip-hop. They followed with *Good Thang* (1978) and *Breakin' the Funk* (1979), both produced by Satchell, expanding their sound with extended arrangements and contributions from Ohio Players members like Billy Beck. Despite initial success, the band dissolved by the early 1980s amid waning commercial fortunes.[1][2]

Post-dissolution, members pursued notable careers: Harrison joined Heatwave for *Candles* (1980) and later the Dazz Band starting with *On the One* (1983), remaining active as of 2024; Parker played with Slave on *Show Time* and Steve Arrington's Hall of Fame. Faze-O has reunited sporadically, including a 2011 performance with Harrison, Neal, and Aikens, and a full original lineup reunion interview in 2015 for Dayton's Funk Music Hall of Fame. Tragically, Neal died in 2021 and Parker in 2023.[1]
