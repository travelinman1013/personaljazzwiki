## Biography
Banu Gibson, an Ohio native, began her artistic journey early, studying dance and voice as a pre-teen and majoring in music and theater in college. She started performing professionally in her teens as a dancer and singer, landing her first steady gig in 1967 at Jackie Gleason’s Joe the Bartender’s Room in Miami Beach, where she was exposed to traditional jazz through Dixieland trumpeter Phil Napoleon. At 21, she moved to New York City, joining the group My Father's Mustache as a singer and dancer from 1969-1972, shifting focus to singing in smaller venues. She also performed in Disneyland's 'Class of ‘27' show in California, choreographing and writing comedy material.[1][2][4][6]

In 1973, Gibson married banjo player Buzz Podewell and relocated to New Orleans after he joined Tulane University’s theater department. Encouraged by her husband, she learned banjo in tenor tuning for its 1920s sound and later picked up guitar in 1986 at the suggestion of pianist David Boeddinghaus. She sang with top local bands like the Dukes of Dixieland, Jack London’s Bayou Jazz Band, and Connie Jones’s Crescent City All-Stars before forming her New Orleans Hot Jazz Orchestra in 1981, initially as a Bourbon Street band that quickly gained international acclaim. Known for her swinging interpretations of 1920s-1940s Tin Pan Alley standards and jazz classics by composers like Gershwin, Ellington, Berlin, Carmichael, Waller, and Porter, she performed at major venues including the Boston Pops, Hollywood Bowl, Playboy Jazz Festival, and symphony orchestras worldwide, toured Europe with Wild Bill Davison, and appeared on PBS shows like *Dixieland Jazz from New Orleans* and *Riverboat Ragfest*.[1][2][3][4]

Gibson’s legacy endures as a premier bandleader and vocalist dedicated to early jazz and ragtime, executive director of The New Orleans Trad Jazz Camp, and a performer who has recorded for labels like World, Stomp Off, Jazzology, and her own Swing Out. Her career, built through relentless road work in saloons, theaters, festivals, cruises, and TV, embodies the spirit of classic jazz, earning her titles like 'First Lady of the Bayou.'[1][2][3]

## Fun Facts
- A brother once spotted 'two tubas' across the street in 1981, leading to the discovery of Banu’s band, but it was just a mirror reflection of one tuba player.[1]
- Performed at Jackie Gleason’s club alongside stars like Woody Allen, Art Carney, and Cary Grant, gaining early jazz exposure.[4]
- Toured Europe with Wild Bill Davison after he quit drinking; he called her 'This broad can sing!'[1]
- Brought in the millennium as the only guest artist with the Boston Pops at Symphony Hall and appeared on Garrison Keillor’s *A Prairie Home Companion*.[3]
