## Biography
Chester Arthur Burnett, known professionally as Howlin' Wolf, was born on June 10, 1910, in White Station, Mississippi (near West Point). Growing up in poverty on a cotton plantation, Burnett experienced a difficult childhood—after his parents separated, he was sent to live with an uncle who treated him harshly, prompting him to run away at age 13 to live with his father, a sharecropper. During the 1920s and 1930s, he became a protégé of Delta blues legend Charley Patton, who gave him guitar lessons after Burnett received a guitar as a birthday present in 1928. He also learned harmonica from Sonny Boy Williamson II (Rice Miller), who had married Wolf's half-sister, and developed his distinctive vocal style by incorporating yodels and moans inspired by Tommy Johnson and country singer Jimmie Rodgers. Standing well over six feet tall and weighing close to 300 pounds, Burnett's massive physical presence matched his powerful, gravelly voice, earning him the nickname "Howlin' Wolf."

In the 1940s, Wolf moved to Arkansas where he formed his own group that included future blues stars James Cotton and Little Junior Parker. His breakthrough came in 1951 when his first record "Moanin' at Midnight," recorded for producer Sam Phillips in Memphis after being recruited by Ike Turner, became a hit and led to a record deal with Chess Records in Chicago. Wolf relocated to Chicago and became a central figure in transforming acoustic Delta blues into electric Chicago blues, recording his biggest hits and most enduring works during the 1950s and 1960s, including "Spoonful" and "Killing Floor." Between 1951 and 1969, six of his songs reached the Billboard R&B charts. As a bandleader, Wolf earned respect for his professionalism—he was always prompt and generous in paying his musicians and even provided health insurance and Social Security benefits. His live performances were legendary; he would jump about the stage, wriggle on the floor, and howl with such intensity that he became the living embodiment of the blues' most powerful forces.

Wolf's reputation grew significantly during the blues revival of the 1960s when British and American rock stars openly acknowledged his influence. He recorded several acclaimed albums including "The Howlin' Wolf Album" (1969), "Message to the Young" (1971), "The London Howlin' Wolf Sessions" (1971), and "The Back Door Wolf" (1973). His career spanned four decades, during which he recorded blues, rhythm and blues, rock and roll, and even psychedelic rock. After years of deteriorating health exacerbated by a 1970 car accident, Wolf performed for the last time in November 1975 alongside B.B. King. He died on January 10, 1976, in Hines, Illinois, and is buried at Oakridge Cemetery in Hillside, Illinois, with a guitar and harmonica engraved on his headstone. His legacy as one of the most influential blues musicians of all time was cemented with posthumous inductions into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1980 and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1991.
