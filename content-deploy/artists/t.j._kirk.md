## Biography
T.J. Kirk is a jazz-funk quartet formed in San Francisco in the mid-1990s, known for their inventive fusion of jazz, funk, and acid jazz. The group was conceived by eight-string guitarist Charlie Hunter as a side project to his own band, and it brought together three guitarists—Charlie Hunter, Will Bernard, and John Schott—along with drummer Scott Amendola. The band's name is a playful nod to their three primary musical influences: Thelonious Monk (T), James Brown (J), and Rahsaan Roland Kirk (Kirk), whose compositions they reinterpreted with a distinctive groove-oriented approach[3][4][1].

T.J. Kirk quickly gained recognition for their energetic live performances and imaginative arrangements, blending the complex harmonies of Monk, the rhythmic drive of James Brown, and the adventurous spirit of Roland Kirk. Their debut album, released in 1995, showcased this unique synthesis, while their follow-up, 'If Four Was One' (1996), received a Grammy nomination for Best Contemporary Jazz Album. Although their discography is limited, the group left a lasting impression on the jazz fusion scene with their virtuosic musicianship and playful, genre-blurring style[3][4][1].

Despite their relatively brief run, T.J. Kirk is remembered for their innovative reinterpretations of jazz and funk classics, and for highlighting the creative possibilities of collaborative musicianship. Their legacy endures in the continued work of its members, all of whom have gone on to notable solo careers and collaborations in the jazz and improvisational music worlds[3][1].
