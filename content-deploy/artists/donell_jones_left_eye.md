## Biography
Donell Jones (born May 22, 1973, in Chicago, Illinois) is an acclaimed American R&B singer, songwriter, and producer, celebrated for his smooth vocal style and heartfelt songwriting. Raised in a musically rich yet challenging environment on Chicago's South Side, Jones began writing songs at age 12 and sang with the group Porscha as a teenager. His early exposure to both East and West Coast music scenes influenced his versatile sound, blending classic R&B with elements of neo soul and quiet storm. After leaving street life behind, Jones focused on music, eventually catching the attention of producer Eddie F, who helped him secure a deal with LaFace Records.

Jones's debut album, 'My Heart' (1996), marked his entry into the industry, but it was his sophomore release, 'Where I Wanna Be' (1999), that established him as a leading R&B artist. The album featured the global hit 'U Know What's Up,' which included a remix with Lisa 'Left Eye' Lopes of TLC, and solidified his reputation for crafting relatable, emotionally resonant songs. Over the years, Jones has released several successful albums, including 'Life Goes On' (2002) and 'Journey of a Gemini' (2006), and has written for major artists such as Usher and 702. His legacy is defined by his consistent chart presence, platinum records, and influence on the evolution of contemporary R&B.

Lisa 'Left Eye' Lopes (May 27, 1971 – April 25, 2002) was an iconic American rapper, singer, and songwriter, best known as a member of the groundbreaking girl group TLC. Renowned for her distinctive rap style and creative vision, Lopes contributed significantly to TLC's success throughout the 1990s. Her collaboration with Donell Jones on 'U Know What's Up' remains a highlight of both artists' careers, bridging the worlds of hip-hop and R&B and showcasing her enduring impact on the genre.
