## Biography
Corey Harris is an acclaimed American blues and reggae musician, born on February 21, 1969, in Denver, Colorado. He began playing guitar at age 12, inspired by his mother's Lightnin' Hopkins records, and developed his vocal skills singing in church choirs. Harris attended Bates College in Maine, majoring in anthropology, and received a Thomas J. Watson Fellowship to study African linguistics in Cameroon. His time in West Africa profoundly shaped his musical approach, infusing his blues with African polyrhythms and reggae influences.

Harris started his career as a street singer in New Orleans, quickly gaining a reputation for his mastery of acoustic Delta blues. His debut album, 'Between Midnight and Day' (1995), showcased his ability to interpret classic blues, while subsequent releases such as 'Fish Ain't Bitin'' (1997) and 'Greens from the Garden' (1999) demonstrated his evolution into a songwriter who blended blues, funk, R&B, reggae, and hip-hop. Harris's 2002 collaboration with Malian guitarist Ali Farka Touré on 'Mississippi to Mali' exemplifies his commitment to bridging African and American musical traditions.

Throughout his career, Harris has toured internationally and collaborated with a wide range of artists, including Billy Bragg, Wilco, and Natalie Merchant. He is recognized for revitalizing country blues with a modern sensibility, earning accolades such as the W.C. Handy Award for Best Acoustic Blues Album and a MacArthur Fellowship in 2007. Harris's legacy lies in his innovative fusion of genres and his role in the contemporary revival of acoustic blues.
