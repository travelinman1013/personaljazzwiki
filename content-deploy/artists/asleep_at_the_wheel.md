## Biography
Asleep at the Wheel is an American Western swing music group formed in 1970 in Paw Paw, West Virginia, by Ray Benson (born Ray Seifert), along with steel guitarist Reuben Gosfield (known as Lucky Oceans) and rhythm guitarist Leroy Preston. The band's origin story began when Benson and Oceans, both students at Antioch colleges in Ohio and Maryland respectively, met Preston in Boston in 1969. After spending formative months in a cabin near Paw Paw, West Virginia, bonding and developing their musical foundation, the band played its first gig on August 25, 1970, as an unannounced opener for Alice Cooper and Hot Tuna at L'Enfant Plaza in Washington, D.C.—a performance arranged through connections with the legendary Hog Farm commune. The band relocated to Oakland, California in 1971, where they quickly gained a following and recorded their debut album, Comin' Right at Ya, in Nashville in 1972. At Willie Nelson's invitation, they moved to Austin, Texas in 1974, where they have remained based ever since and became the torchbearers of Western swing music.

Throughout their career spanning over five decades, Asleep at the Wheel has become the most iconic Western swing band of the modern era, successfully blending Bob Wills' Western swing tradition with Count Basie-style big-band jazz and contemporary country elements. The band's lineup has evolved considerably over the years, with Ray Benson remaining the only constant member. Key early members included pianist Floyd Domino, who joined after a one-song audition in the early 1970s, and female vocalist Chris O'Connell, whose sultry voice became a signature element of their sound in the late 1970s. The band achieved significant commercial recognition in 1977 with the album The Wheel, which climbed into the top 40 of the Country charts and earned two Grammy nominations, while Rolling Stone named them Best Country Western Band and the Academy of Country Music awarded them Touring Band of the Year. Despite facing challenges in the 1980s when record labels abandoned efforts to push them into mainstream success, the band persevered through touring and diversified revenue streams, including a famous partnership with Budweiser that resulted in the iconic jingle "For all you do, this Bud's for you." By the late 1980s, they had rebounded to release some of their most successful albums. Over their career, Asleep at the Wheel has won nine Grammy Awards, released over 20 albums, charted more than 21 singles on the Billboard country charts (with their highest-charting single being "The Letter That Johnny Walker Read" at number 10 in 1975), and been inducted into the ACL Hall of Fame, establishing themselves as the rightful caretakers of Western swing music.

## Fun Facts
- The band's first gig on August 25, 1970, was completely unannounced—they were invited by the Hog Farm commune (led by Wavy Gravy) to open for Alice Cooper and Hot Tuna at L'Enfant Plaza in Washington, D.C., after a gas station attendant in West Virginia told the Hog Farm school bus about the hippie band living by the railroad tracks.
- In the 1980s, when record labels abandoned the band and they struggled financially, their manager secured a partnership with Budweiser that led to Ray Benson's distinctive deep baritone voice becoming iconic in the famous jingle 'For all you do, this Bud's for you'—a commercial that aired throughout the decade.
- Pianist Floyd Domino was hired after just a one-song audition in the early 1970s; he had changed his name from Jim Haber and was a jazz-trained musician from Berkeley who became a crucial part of the band's evolving sound.
- The band's 1977 album The Wheel was a breakthrough moment, climbing into the top 40 of the Country charts, earning two Grammy nominations, and resulting in Rolling Stone naming them Best Country Western Band and the Academy of Country Music awarding them Touring Band of the Year—yet they still struggled to achieve mainstream commercial success that satisfied record labels.
