## Biography
Cliff Jackson (Clifton Luther Jackson), born on July 19, 1902, in Culpeper, Virginia, was a prominent Black jazz stride pianist who began his professional career playing in Atlantic City and Washington before moving to New York City in 1923. There, he performed with Lionel Howard's Musical Aces in 1924 and recorded as an accompanist to blues singers including Rosa Henderson, Helen Gross, Josie Miles, Maggie Jones, Rosetta Crawford, Martha Copeland, Viola McCoy, Jane Howard, and Clara Smith during 1924-1928, with additional sessions alongside Lizzie Miles in 1928.[1][2][5] In 1927, he recorded with clarinetist Bob Fuller and banjoist Elmer Snowden, showcasing his emerging stride piano style marked by powerful left-hand techniques and contrapuntal bass work.[1][2][4]

Jackson formed his ten-piece big band, Cliff Jackson and His Crazy Kats (also spelled Krazy Kats), in 1930, recording 15 spirited tracks in New York that January-February, including classics like 'Horse Feathers,' 'Torrid Rhythm,' and 'The Terror.' The band, known for its enthusiastic, territory-band-like sound despite some imprecision, played regularly at Harlem's Lenox Club on 652 Lenox Avenue until around 1932.[1][3][7] After the group's breakup, Jackson transitioned to solo piano work in New York nightclubs, serving as house pianist at Cafe Society from 1943 to 1951, touring with Eddie Condon in 1946, and recording solo sessions in 1944-1945, 1961, and 1969, as well as with Sidney Bechet (1940-1941), Garvin Bushell (1950), J.C. Higginbotham (1960), and Joe Thomas (1962).[1][2]

Renowned for his robust stride piano, exemplified in recordings like 'Limehouse Blues,' Jackson married singer Maxine Sullivan in 1950 and continued performing until his death from heart failure on May 24, 1970, in New York City, leaving a legacy as one of the great stride pianists of the 1920s-1970s era.[1][2]

## Fun Facts
- Cliff Jackson's Crazy Kats recordings from early 1930 captured a pre-Depression joyful spirit, with the band sounding like a lively territory ensemble despite being New York-based and playing at Harlem's Lenox Club, a favorite spot for Duke Ellington's orchestra members.[1][3]
- The band's 'Horse Feathers' was the first side recorded at their initial 1930 session and appeared on a rare dark brown shellac Madison label record paired unusually with a sweet fox-trot by another orchestra.[3]
- Jackson did not record as a featured instrumentalist or leader until 1930 with Crazy Kats, after years solely accompanying blues singers, with his first solo piano recordings delayed until 1944.[1]
- He was married to jazz singer Maxine Sullivan from 1950 until his death in 1970.[2]
