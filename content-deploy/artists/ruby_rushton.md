## Biography
Ruby Rushton are a south London-based jazz group led by multi-instrumentalist and producer Ed Cawthorne, better known as Tenderlonious, and named in tribute to his grandmother, Ruby Rushton.[6][9][10] Emerging from the early 2010s London scene, Cawthorne initially recorded the band’s debut album *Two For Joy* in 2011 and eventually released it in 2015 on his own 22a label, a move that helped launch both the imprint and what has often been described as a new wave of UK jazz centered in London.[1][2][5] The early quartet line-up featured Cawthorne on saxophones and flute, trumpeter Nick Walters, keyboardist Aidan Shepherd, and drummer Yussef Dayes, blending modal post‑bop, soul‑jazz, Afro‑beat and Latin grooves with contemporary influences from funk, electronica and hip‑hop.[1][2]

Over time Ruby Rushton evolved through shifting line‑ups and an expanding sonic palette while keeping a core nucleus of Cawthorne, Walters and Shepherd.[1][2][4] Later recordings such as *Trudi’s Songbook* (Volumes One and Two), *Ironside* (2019) and *Legacy!* (2025) showcased tighter arrangements alongside the band’s improvisational roots, with drummers including Fergus Ireland (on bass with others on drums), Eddie Hick and Tim Carnegie contributing to the group’s rhythmic drive.[2][4][6] On *Legacy!* the quartet moved away from their earlier, largely one‑take live studio approach and embraced overdubbing, layering flutes, saxophones, trumpet, flugelhorn, keyboards and additional percussion into warm, compact compositions predominantly written by Tenderlonious and Aidan Shepherd.[4][6] Across their catalog, Ruby Rushton have become a key voice at the forefront of 21st‑century British nu‑jazz, noted for marrying classic post‑bop and spiritual jazz traditions with a distinctly modern London sensibility.[1][5][6]

The group’s musical style draws explicitly on the modal jazz explorations of players such as Yusef Lateef and John Coltrane, filtered through the band’s own soul‑jazz and groove‑oriented language.[1] Critics have highlighted their “experimental jazz quartet” identity and the way their compositions balance singable themes, rich harmony and rhythmic elasticity with accessible, danceable energy.[1][6][7] Through live shows, recordings on 22a and high‑profile sessions such as their 2015 Boiler Room appearance, Ruby Rushton have been cited as one of the ensembles that helped energize the contemporary UK jazz landscape, positioning Tenderlonious and his collaborators as central figures in London’s new‑jazz movement.[1][5][6]

## Fun Facts
- The band name Ruby Rushton is not a person in the group but the name of bandleader Ed ‘Tenderlonious’ Cawthorne’s grandmother, chosen as a personal tribute.[6][9][10]
- *Two For Joy*, widely viewed as Ruby Rushton’s debut, was actually recorded around 2011 but sat unreleased for several years until Tenderlonious founded the 22a label and issued it in 2015.[5]
- Ruby Rushton initially favored raw, single‑take live recordings in the studio, but for their fifth album *Legacy!* they deliberately shifted to a more produced, overdubbed approach while still keeping the music light and cohesive.[4][6]
- A Boiler Room session in 2015 featuring Ruby Rushton was notable because there had been few explicitly jazz‑focused sessions on the platform at that time, helping bring the band and the wider London jazz scene to a new audience.[5]
