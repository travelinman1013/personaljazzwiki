## Biography
Terence Oliver Blanchard, born on March 13, 1962, in New Orleans, Louisiana, to Wilhelmina and Joseph Oliver Blanchard, began his musical journey playing piano at age 5 before switching to trumpet at age 8.[1][5][8] While studying jazz at Rutgers University, he toured with the Lionel Hampton Orchestra in 1980 and, in 1982 at age 19, dropped out to replace Wynton Marsalis in Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers upon Marsalis's recommendation, serving as musical director until 1986.[1][2][4][5] He co-led a quintet with fellow New Orleans native saxophonist Donald Harrison, recording five to seven albums between 1984 and 1988 or 1990 for labels like Columbia and Concord.[1][4][8][10]

Blanchard launched his solo career in 1991 with a self-titled debut album on Columbia Records, which reached third on the Billboard Jazz Charts, while beginning a prolific collaboration with director Spike Lee, composing scores for over 40 of his films, including Oscar-nominated works for *BlacKkKlansman* (2018) and *Da 5 Bloods* (2020).[1][2][4][10] His style blends jazz with New Orleans influences, Latin jazz elements, and extends into opera, Broadway, and orchestral works; he released 20 solo albums, earned 15 Grammy nominations with six wins, and premiered his first opera *Champion* in 2013 and *Fire Shut Up in My Bones* in 2021 at the Metropolitan Opera, the first by an African American composer there.[1][3][4][7] Positions include artistic director of the Thelonious Monk Institute (2000), Henry Mancini Institute (2011), Endowed Chair in Jazz Studies at UCLA (2019), and executive artistic director at SFJAZZ.[1][2][3]

Blanchard's legacy as a Renaissance figure in jazz lies in his boundary-breaking compositions addressing American tragedies, from film scores to operas, alongside virtuoso trumpet playing, earning him 2024 NEA Jazz Master status and induction into the American Academy of Arts and Letters.[3][6][10]
