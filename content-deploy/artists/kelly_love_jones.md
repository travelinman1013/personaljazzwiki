## Biography
Kelly Love Jones is a New Orleans–based singer, songwriter, multi‑instrumentalist, producer, and director whose work bridges reggae, soul, Americana, world music, and lovers rock. Appointed a United Nations “Messenger of Truth” and recognized as a Louisiana Music Ambassador, she has spent more than two decades using music as a vehicle for healing, storytelling, and social uplift.[3][2][6] Raised in the New Orleans area with formative time in St. Louis and Houston, she deepened her craft early through classical guitar lessons funded and closely supervised by an aunt who insisted she practice daily.[1][2] In high school and at the Art Institute of Houston, Jones moved between hip‑hop, freestyling at pep rallies, and live performance, eventually earning a videography degree before returning to New Orleans to study sound recording and work in local venues, where she learned live engineering, band dynamics, and the city’s rich musical culture.[1]

Jones’ first group, Understatement, grew out of a teenage love for hip‑hop, but she soon began integrating singing and guitar into her performances, developing a hybrid style rooted in groove, improvisation, and intimate storytelling.[1] Back in New Orleans, she gained early exposure working at Storyville District, then as a vocalist and guitarist with jazz drummer James Alsanders’ band at the Funky Butt, which led to regular club work and support from heavyweights like George Porter Jr., who invited her to open for his band.[1] Over time she released a growing catalog of independent albums, including her eighth album *Surrender*—unveiled through intimate blindfolded listening sessions in her home—and the conceptually driven project *TRUST*, which she expanded into a full stage production that she wrote, produced, directed, and starred in, presented at museums and venues in Louisiana and Atlanta.[1][2][8] Her message‑driven repertoire and outreach to impoverished youth led to her designation as a U.N. Messenger of Truth and multiple touring opportunities, including a self‑organized “Triumphant Tour” of California in 2010 that she completed with her two‑year‑old son in tow, using each show to book the next and embody her philosophy of perseverance.[2]

Artistically, Jones’ music is characterized by warm, soulful vocals, rhythmic guitar work, and cajón‑driven grooves—an instrument she adopted after living in Peru in 2006, where a street performance inspired her to study the Peruvian cajón and bring it into her live shows back home.[1] Her genre‑fluid approach spans reggae, singer‑songwriter, Americana, world music, and soul, unified by lyrics that focus on triumph, possibility, love, forgiveness, and trust.[3][2] Beyond recording and touring, she is a Big Easy Award winner for Best Emerging Artist, a noted storyteller, and a creator of multidisciplinary productions such as “Pitch Dark” and “TRUST,” which integrate narrative, music, and visual staging.[6][4][8] Through these projects and her mentoring of emerging performers in her ensembles and productions, Jones has established a legacy in the New Orleans arts community as an “alchemist of people” who not only performs but also curates spaces where other artists can shine and audiences can experience music as a transformative, communal ritual.[1][5]

## Fun Facts
- Jones once organized a nine‑month “Triumphant Tour” of California starting with only three booked shows, a one‑way ticket, $80, her guitar, and her two‑year‑old son, booking the rest of the tour on the fly from contacts made at each performance.[2]
- During that tour, her toddler sometimes slept inside her open guitar case onstage while she performed, symbolizing her commitment to balancing motherhood with a full‑time music career.[2]
- She was spontaneously invited to Barcelona for a World Music Summit after a doctor fan contacted her, leading to her appointment by the United Nations as a “Messenger of Truth” for the impact of her music on impoverished youth worldwide.[2][1]
- Jones discovered the cajón while living in Peru in 2006 after following the sound of street music; she asked a woman performer to teach her, then brought the instrument back to New Orleans, where it became one of her signature sounds on stage.[1]
