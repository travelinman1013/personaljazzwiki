## Biography
William James "Count" Basie (August 21, 1904 – April 26, 1984) was born in Red Bank, New Jersey, to a musical family—his father played mellophone and his mother was a pianist who gave Basie his first lessons. In his youth, Basie was influenced by stride pianists such as James P. Johnson and Fats Waller, with Waller teaching him organ techniques. Basie began his professional career playing vaudeville and eventually found himself in Kansas City, where he joined Walter Page's Blue Devils and later Bennie Moten's band. After Moten's death in 1935, Basie formed his own group, the Barons of Rhythm, which evolved into the Count Basie Orchestra, quickly gaining recognition for its dynamic swing style and exceptional soloists.[1][3][5]

Basie's orchestra became one of the most influential big bands of the swing era, noted for its "head arrangements"—simple, riff-based structures that showcased improvisation and the talents of its members. His minimalist piano style and emphasis on the rhythm section set his band apart, and hits like "One O'Clock Jump" and "Jumpin' at the Woodside" became jazz standards. Basie led his orchestra for nearly 50 years, adapting to changing musical landscapes and collaborating with vocalists such as Joe Williams, Ella Fitzgerald, and Frank Sinatra. He won nine Grammy Awards, including being the first African American male recipient in 1958, and his recordings are celebrated for their precision, swing, and innovation.[1][2][5]

Count Basie's legacy is profound: he helped establish swing as a dominant jazz style, mentored generations of musicians, and solidified the connection between jazz and blues. His orchestra launched the careers of many jazz greats, and his approach to bandleading and arranging influenced countless artists. Basie's music remains a cornerstone of jazz, celebrated for its elegance, energy, and enduring appeal.[1][2][3][5]

- Basie's band was known for its 'head arrangements,' often created and memorized in rehearsal rather than written down.[2]
