## Biography
Robert Earl Keen, Jr. (born January 11, 1956 in Houston, Texas) is a celebrated American singer-songwriter whose work has been pivotal in shaping the genres of Texas Country, Americana, and alt-country. Growing up in Houston, Keen was drawn to music, sports, movies, and writing, and was influenced by the remnants of the city's vibrant 1960s folk scene. He attended Texas A&M University, earning a degree in English in 1978, and it was there that he began performing and writing songs, forging a lifelong friendship and musical partnership with fellow student Lyle Lovett. Their front porch jam sessions inspired the now-classic "The Front Porch Song"[2][3][1].

After college, Keen moved to Austin, immersing himself in its thriving live music scene and performing in nightclubs for tips. He self-financed his first EP in 1984 and, after a brief stint in Nashville, returned to Texas where he released his national debut album, "West Textures," in 1989, featuring the iconic track "The Road Goes on Forever." Keen's music is known for its literary storytelling, blending folk, country, bluegrass, blues, and roots rock, and his raucous live performances have earned him a devoted cult following. Over a career spanning more than four decades, Keen released 21 albums, toured extensively, and became a major figure in the birth of Americana and Texas Country, inspiring a new generation of musicians[2][3][1][4].

Keen's legacy is rooted in his ability to evoke the spirit of Texas while exploring universal themes, and his songs have been covered by artists such as Lyle Lovett, George Strait, and The Highwaymen. He has received numerous honors, including the Texas A&M Distinguished Alumni Award, and has supported music education through benefit concerts for organizations like the Hill Country Youth Orchestras. As he retired from touring in 2022, Keen left behind a lasting influence on the Texas music landscape and Americana genre[3][4][1].
