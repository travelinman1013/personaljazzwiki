## Biography
Deitch, Teitel, Fribush (DTF) is a brass band-influenced organ trio formed by Grammy-nominated drummer Adam Deitch of Lettuce, Grammy-nominated guitarist Ari Teitel of Dumpstaphunk and The Rumble, and rising star organist Sam Fribush, a New England Conservatory graduate from Greensboro. The trio emerged from a musical connection between Fribush and Teitel, who met performing at a church in Uptown New Orleans, blending vintage funky soul-jazz with modern hip-hop production. Their self-titled project debuted with the album *Another Side of the Sound* on May 23, 2025, recorded straight to vintage Tascam tape at Colorado Sound Studios without a click track, featuring original compositions and covers like The Allman Brothers Band's 'Midnight Rider' and Bell Biv DeVoe's 'Poison'.[1][2][3]

The group's musical style fuses classic '60s and '70s soul-jazz organ trio traditions—drawing from influences like Jimmy Smith, The Meters, Tower of Power, and J Dilla—with contemporary grooves, gospel polyphony, future funk beats, and hip-hop sensibilities. Fribush's soulful Hammond B3 work, Teitel's genre-defying guitar with wah-wah and delay effects, and Deitch's impeccable timing create a sound that is nostalgic yet innovative, described as 'greasy, unadulterated instrumental funk' with chill, breathable spaces.[2][3][4] They made their live debut as a trio at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival in 2025 with a sold-out show at the historic Maple Leaf.[3]

DTF represents a fresh evolution in the organ trio format, pushing boundaries while honoring roots in funk, jazz, R&B, and New Orleans traditions. With members' extensive pedigrees—Deitch's collaborations with John Scofield and Talib Kweli, Teitel's Detroit and NOLA funk scenes, and Fribush's work with Charlie Hunter and Hiss Golden Messenger—the trio has quickly positioned itself as a standout in modern jazz and funk.[1][4]
