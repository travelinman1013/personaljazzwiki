## Biography
Eric Johanson is an American blues rock singer, guitarist, and songwriter, born and raised in Alexandria, Louisiana. Immersed in music from an early age—his grandparents owned a music shop and his family members played in local bands—Johanson received his first guitar at age five and was soon performing blues in regional bands by his teens. His musical upbringing included listening to both classic blues artists like Robert Johnson and Freddie King, as well as hard rock acts such as Metallica and Soundgarden, which contributed to his distinctive blend of blues, rock, and progressive Americana.

After relocating to New Orleans for college, Johanson became a fixture in the city’s vibrant music scene, performing with seasoned musicians and developing a style that merged the emotional depth of blues with the intensity of rock. His career was briefly interrupted by Hurricane Katrina, prompting a move to New Zealand, but he returned to New Orleans in 2010 and quickly became an in-demand session guitarist. Johanson’s solo career took off when blues icon Tab Benoit signed him to Whiskey Bayou Records, producing his debut album 'Burn It Down' in 2017. Subsequent albums, including 'Below Sea Level' (produced by Luther Dickinson), have consistently charted on Billboard’s Blues Albums Chart, and his dynamic live performances have established him as a leading voice in modern blues-rock.
