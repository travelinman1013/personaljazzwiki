## Biography
Tedeschi Trucks Band is a large American roots-music ensemble formed in 2010 by guitarist Derek Trucks and singer-guitarist Susan Tedeschi, a married couple who each had thriving solo careers before combining their bands and songwriting into a single project.[4][1] Based out of Jacksonville, Florida, and drawing on deep ties to the Allman Brothers Band (Derek is the nephew of founding drummer Butch Trucks), the group debuted with the 11‑piece lineup that became its hallmark: dual guitars, a full rhythm section, three vocalists, and a horn section, all centered on Tedeschi’s powerful, gospel‑tinged voice and Trucks’s highly lyrical slide guitar.[3][4][6] Their first studio album, *Revelator* (2011), recorded at the couple’s Swamp Raga Studio in Florida, immediately established them as a major force in modern blues and Southern rock, earning widespread critical acclaim and positioning the band as torchbearers for expansive, improvisation‑friendly American rock ensembles.[1][3]

Revelator was followed by the live set *Everybody’s Talkin’* (2012), then the studio albums *Made Up Mind* (2013) and *Let Me Get By* (2016), which showcased increasingly original songwriting and a blend of blues, soul, rock, funk, and jazz influences.[3][4] Known for marathon concerts and fluid, jam‑oriented arrangements, Tedeschi Trucks Band built its reputation on the road as a 12‑piece touring “phenomenon,” frequently reworking songs and spotlighting different band members in extended improvisations.[4] In the 2020s they undertook one of their most ambitious projects, the four‑part album cycle *I Am The Moon* (2022), developed collectively at the Trucks family farm in rural Georgia and recorded by a core lineup before adding backing vocalists and horns, underscoring the group’s identity as a collaborative musical family rather than a traditional backing band.[4] Across their catalog and performances, they have carried forward the improvisational, song‑driven legacy of the Allman Brothers and classic American soul while shaping a modern, genre‑spanning sound that has influenced a new generation of blues‑rock and jam‑band artists.[3][4][5]

Musically, Tedeschi Trucks Band fuse electric blues, Southern rock, and soul with jazz harmonies and gospel overtones, often stretching songs into exploratory pieces that highlight Trucks’s slide guitar and the interplay of multiple singers and horns.[3][4] Tedeschi’s background in church music and Boston blues clubs, combined with Trucks’s early immersion in jazz and his tenure with the Allman Brothers Band, informs a style that treats American roots music as a single, interconnected tradition.[1][3][5] Their legacy rests not only on awards and critical accolades but on their role in sustaining the large‑ensemble rock band format—complete with horns and multiple vocalists—in an era dominated by smaller groups and solo acts, inspiring peers and younger musicians to pursue similarly ambitious live and studio projects.[2][4][5]
