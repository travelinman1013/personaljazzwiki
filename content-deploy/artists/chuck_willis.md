## Biography
Harold "Chuck" Willis was born on January 31, 1926, in Atlanta, Georgia. He was discovered at a local talent contest by radio DJ Zenas Sears, who became his manager and helped him secure a recording contract with Columbia Records in 1951. Willis quickly established himself as a gifted songwriter and performer, releasing his early work on Columbia's Okeh subsidiary and developing a reputation for soulful, literate, and melancholy compositions. By 1956, he joined Atlantic Records, where he achieved national fame with hits like "It's Too Late," "Juanita," and "Love Me Cherry."

Willis's most iconic recording was "C.C. Rider" (1957), a reinterpretation of the classic twelve-bar blues originally performed by Ma Rainey. The song's relaxed rhythm and vibraphone backing inspired the popular dance known as "The Stroll," earning Willis the nickname "The King of the Stroll." He followed this success with "Betty and Dupree," another stroll song, and "What Am I Living For," which became the top R&B disc of 1958 and was the first rock and roll record released in stereo. Willis was known for his stage presence, often performing in a turban—a suggestion from his friend Screamin' Jay Hawkins—and hosting a weekly TV show in Atlanta that featured artists like Ray Charles and Sam Cooke.

Willis's legacy is marked by his influence on rhythm and blues and early rock and roll. His meticulous approach to songwriting and his ability to blend blues, R&B, and pop helped shape the sound of the 1950s. Despite his untimely death at age 32 in 1958, his songs have been widely covered and his style has inspired generations of musicians.
