## Biography
Karen Elson, born Karen Jill Elson on January 15, 1979, in Oldham, near Manchester, northern England, grew up in a working-class family and began her modeling career at age 15, quickly rising to prominence with Vogue covers by 18 and international runway work.[1][2][3][7] She transitioned into music while living in New York, joining the politico cabaret group The Citizens Band in 2003 alongside figures like Nina Persson, Zoe Kravitz, and Zooey Deschanel, before secretly developing her songwriting in Nashville after marrying Jack White in 2005 and relocating there serendipitously.[1][2][3] Her debut solo album, *The Ghost Who Walks*, released in 2010 on White's Third Man Records, blended American gothic, southern gothic, blues, and country elements, earning favorable reviews comparing her voice to Jenny Lewis and Loretta Lynn; she followed with *Double Roses* in 2017, featuring contributions from Laura Marling, Father John Misty, and Patrick Carney, and *Green* in 2022.[1][2][3][4][6]

Elson's musical style evolved from secretive, image-driven gothic ballads to vulnerable, introspective 'romantic realist' songwriting, shedding artifice for authenticity amid personal challenges like her divorce from White and raising two children in Nashville, where she has deep roots.[1][2] Beyond music, she remains a successful model, designing for Nine West, walking in events like the 2012 Olympics closing ceremony, and authoring a memoir *The Red Flame*, while engaging in art projects like a 2022 Parthenon exhibition.[1][3] Her career reflects stubborn drive, balancing modeling's objectification with creative autonomy in Music City.[1][2]

Elson's legacy lies in her multifaceted reinvention from supermodel to singer-songwriter, fostering a niche in southern gothic Americana while contributing to Nashville's cultural scene, with ongoing releases and collaborations underscoring her enduring relevance.[1][2][3]
