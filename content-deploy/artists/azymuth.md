## Biography
Azymuth is a pioneering Brazilian jazz-funk trio formed in Rio de Janeiro in 1973 by keyboardist José Roberto Bertrami, bassist Alex Malheiros, and drummer Ivan 'Mamão' Conti. The three musicians began their careers in the vibrant bossa nova and jazz scene of Rio during the 1960s, working as session musicians and collaborating in small bars and studios. Their first joint project was under the name Grupo Projeto 3 in 1968, but it was in the early 1970s, after working with Marcos Valle on a soundtrack LP, that they adopted the name Azymuth, inspired by one of Valle's track titles[2][1].

Azymuth quickly became known for their innovative fusion of jazz, funk, rock, and samba, a style they dubbed 'samba doido' (crazy samba). Their debut album, Azimüth, was released in 1975, followed by Águia Não Come Mosca in 1977. The group gained international recognition after performing at the Montreux Jazz Festival in 1977 and signing with Milestone Records, leading to a prolific run of albums and collaborations with artists such as Flora Purim, Airto Moreira, and Mark Murphy[1][5]. Their 1979 single 'Jazz Carnival' became a global hit, reaching number 19 on the UK Singles Chart and solidifying their reputation as one of Brazil's most successful and influential bands[3][2].

Over a career spanning more than five decades, Azymuth has released over 30 studio albums and contributed to countless recordings by Brazilian and international artists. Their sound, characterized by electronic instruments, angular arrangements, and a seamless blend of jazz, funk, and samba, has influenced generations of musicians worldwide. Despite lineup changes, including the passing of Bertrami in 2012, Azymuth continues to perform and record, maintaining their legacy as innovators in Brazilian jazz and global jazz fusion[1][6].
