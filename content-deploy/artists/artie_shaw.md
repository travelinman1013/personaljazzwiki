## Biography
Artie Shaw (born Arthur Jacob Arshawsky on May 23, 1910, in New York City) was one of the most celebrated clarinetists and bandleaders of the swing era. Raised in New Haven, Connecticut, Shaw left home at 15 to tour as a jazz musician, quickly establishing himself as a talented reed player and arranger. After early stints with bands such as Austin Wylie and Irving Aaronson, Shaw became a sought-after studio musician in New York, absorbing influences from both jazz and contemporary classical music. His breakthrough came in 1936 with a performance of his chamber jazz piece 'Interlude in B Flat,' which led to the formation of his own orchestra.

Shaw’s big band, which often featured innovative arrangements and occasionally a string section, rose to national prominence in 1938 with his recording of Cole Porter's 'Begin the Beguine.' The record became a defining hit of the era and catapulted Shaw to stardom, rivaling Benny Goodman as a leading figure of swing. Notably, Shaw was an early proponent of integrating Black artists into his bands, hiring Billie Holiday as a vocalist in 1938—a move that drew controversy in segregated America. Shaw’s career was marked by frequent experimentation, including his Gramercy Five small group and forays into Third Stream music, blending jazz and classical forms. He served in the U.S. Navy during World War II, leading a morale-boosting band in the South Pacific.

Despite his success, Shaw was known for his perfectionism and restlessness, leading him to repeatedly disband his groups and eventually retire from music in 1954. He later pursued writing and other interests, publishing an autobiography and short stories. Shaw’s legacy endures as a master clarinetist, a bold bandleader who challenged musical and social conventions, and a major influence on generations of jazz musicians.
