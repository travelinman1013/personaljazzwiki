## Biography
Boukman Eksperyans is a pioneering mizik rasin (roots music) band formed in 1978 in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, by Theodore 'Lolo' Beaubrun Jr., his wife Mimerose 'Manze' Beaubrun, his sister Marjorie, and Daniel Beaubrun, among others. The band’s name pays homage to Dutty Boukman, the Vodou priest who helped ignite the Haitian Revolution, and to their admiration for Jimi Hendrix’s 'The Jimi Hendrix Experience.' Their music fuses traditional Haitian rhythms, Vodou ceremonial music, and modern rock, creating a distinctive sound sometimes called 'vodou rock.'

Boukman Eksperyans rose to international prominence in 1990 with their politically charged song 'Ké-M Pa Sote,' which became an anthem of resistance against Haiti’s military regimes. Their debut album, 'Vodou Adjae,' was nominated for a Grammy Award in 1991, cementing their status as global ambassadors of Haitian culture. The band’s outspoken political stance led them into exile after the 1991 coup d’état, during which they continued to perform and advocate for democracy from abroad. After returning to Haiti in 1994, they remained influential, performing at major festivals worldwide and continuing to address social and political issues through their music.

Their legacy lies in their fearless blending of ancestral Haitian traditions with contemporary sounds, their role in the mizik rasin movement, and their commitment to social justice. Boukman Eksperyans has inspired generations of Haitian musicians and remains a symbol of cultural pride and resistance.
