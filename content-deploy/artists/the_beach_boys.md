## Biography
The Beach Boys are an American rock band formed in Hawthorne, California, in 1961 by brothers Brian, Dennis, and Carl Wilson, their cousin Mike Love, and friend Al Jardine. Starting as a garage band managed by the Wilsons' father Murry, they initially gained fame with surf-themed songs like 'Surfin'' and 'Surfin' Safari,' capturing the 'California Sound' of youth culture, cars, and romance, which led to national hits after signing with Capitol Records in 1962.[1][2][3][4] Brian Wilson emerged as the creative force, composing, producing, and arranging most tracks, often with lyrics from Mike Love, while the group's signature vocal harmonies drew from 1950s rock and roll, pop vocal groups, and R&B.[4][5]

By 1965-1966, the band evolved beyond beach themes toward introspective lyrics and ambitious studio experimentation, highlighted by the groundbreaking album *Pet Sounds* and the single 'Good Vibrations,' widely regarded as pioneering works in popular music that incorporated classical and jazz elements.[3][4][5] Despite commercial success with over 100 million records sold and enduring popularity during the British Invasion, the group faced tragedies including Dennis Wilson's drowning in 1983, Carl's death, and Brian's struggles with mental illness, drug abuse, and nervous breakdowns.[2][3][5] They were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1988, cementing their legacy as one of rock's most influential acts.[3]

The Beach Boys' innovative recording techniques and multi-layered sounds influenced the psychedelic movement and 1960s counterculture, with Brian Wilson's genius often credited for pushing pop music boundaries.[1][3][4]

## Fun Facts
- The band started as 'The Pendletones' but was renamed 'The Beach Boys' by their record label without their knowledge when their first single shipped.[1][4]
- Only Dennis Wilson actually surfed; Brian was afraid of the ocean, yet they created the iconic surf music genre.[2][5]
- They signed with Capitol Records as its first rock act after being turned down by other labels, debuting nationally with 'Surfin' Safari' in 1962.[4]
- Brian Wilson's childhood was marked by a rough upbringing under strict father Murry, who managed the band early on.[2]
