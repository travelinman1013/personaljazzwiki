## Biography
Birdcloud is a provocative country duo formed in 2010 in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, by Jasmin Kaset and Makenzie Green while both were attending Middle Tennessee State University. Initially, the two did not get along, but they bonded at a barbecue over their shared dislike of another student, leading to their first impromptu songwriting session. Within a week, they were performing live, and a year later, they recorded their debut EP at the Compound, a studio owned by legendary country producer Kyle Lehning, with production by his son Jordan Lehning[1][2][5].

Birdcloud quickly became known for their raw, satirical, and often controversial lyrics, which offer biting commentary on life in the American South. Their music blends elements of country, folk punk, and anti-folk, eschewing polished Nashville production in favor of a gritty, DIY approach. Their live performances are notorious for their confrontational humor and theatrical antics, sometimes involving costumes or shock elements, and their songs frequently address taboo topics with irreverence and dark humor[3][4].

Despite (or because of) their polarizing style, Birdcloud developed a cult following, touring extensively across the United States, Europe, and Australia. Their work has sparked both acclaim and backlash, including death threats and boycotts, particularly for songs like "Indianer" and "Black Guys." After a brief hiatus following their 2018 tour of Australia, the duo resumed activity in 2020, continuing to challenge and entertain audiences with their unapologetic take on American culture[1][6].
