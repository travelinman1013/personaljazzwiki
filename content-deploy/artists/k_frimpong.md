## Biography
Alhaji Mohammed Ibrahim Kwame Frimpong, known as K. Frimpong, was born on July 22, 1939, in Ofoase, Ashanti Region, Ghana. He entered the music world after elementary school, joining bands such as Star de Republic and Oko’s Band before spending over six years with K. Gyasy’s band. By the 1970s, Frimpong had become a leading figure in Ghana’s highlife scene, recording with two prominent bands: Vis-A-Vis, based in Kumasi, and the Cubano Fiestas. His music blended traditional highlife with soul, funk, and Afrobeat, creating a dynamic sound that resonated across generations. Frimpong’s most famous song, 'Kyenkyen Bi Adi M'awu,' became a Ghanaian standard, celebrated for its emotional depth and lyrical resonance. He continued recording into the 1990s, leaving behind a legacy of innovation and cultural significance in African music. Frimpong passed away on October 18, 2005, in Kumasi, Ghana.

K. Frimpong’s musical style was marked by its fusion of orchestral highlife, Afro-funk, and soul, reflecting both the dance-band traditions of the 1950s and the electrified sounds of the 1970s. His work with the Cubano Fiestas and Vis-A-Vis showcased his ability to adapt and innovate, incorporating synthesizers and layered percussion while maintaining the social and lyrical roots of highlife. Albums like 'The Blue Album' and 'Obi Agye Me Dofo' are regarded as classics, praised for their balance of tradition and experimentation. Frimpong’s music remains influential, frequently sampled and celebrated for its emotional authenticity and rhythmic vitality.
