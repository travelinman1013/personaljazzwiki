## Biography
Vernon Garrett is an American soul and blues singer born on January 18, 1933, in Omaha, Nebraska, who emerged from the rich tradition of mid‑20th‑century Black gospel and R&B.[1][4][5] As a child he was drawn to the touring gospel singers who passed through Omaha, and he began singing regularly in Sunday school, encouraged by Deacon Robinson, who asked a child to start each lesson with a song.[1] By his mid‑teens he was performing with local gospel groups such as the Southern Wonders, and his talent led to opportunities to open for major gospel acts including the Swan Silvertones and the Soul Stirrers; for a short period he even sang with the Swan Silvertones themselves before leaving to do military service.[1][3][5] 

After returning from the service, Garrett briefly remained in Omaha, joining a vocal group called The Mixers, but soon decided to pursue his ambitions on the West Coast, relocating alone to Los Angeles when his group declined to move.[1] In L.A. he built a reputation through club talent shows, where he won so often that comedian Leroy “Skillet” advised him to turn professional, leading to regular guest spots at the Brass Rail nightclub and the start of his solo career.[1] He then joined The Sliders as lead singer, becoming part of a vibrant L.A. vocal‑group scene alongside acts like the Hollywood Flames, the Penguins and the Fortunes, and recorded sides such as “Love Is Like a Mountain.”[1] Later, after marrying singer Jewel, he formed the duo Vernon and Jewel, working small clubs in Compton before being signed by jazz saxophonist Illinois Jacquet’s Network label; their early recordings included “You’re Going to Be Paid for the Way You Treated Me,” and the pair later cut a popular male/female version of “Lonely Lonely Nights” for Kent Records, selling strongly in Chicago and allowing them to achieve notable financial success.[1]

Garrett’s solo recording career became closely associated with Los Angeles independent soul labels, particularly Imperial Records and Kent Records, two of the city’s most active soul imprints in the 1960s and 1970s.[2] He also released singles on a range of small local labels—some connected to the Bihari brothers’ network—such as Gator, Grenade, Watt’s U.S.A., L.A. West, Safe!, and Venture, reflecting both his versatility and the fragmented nature of the West Coast soul scene.[2] Demonstrating entrepreneurial drive, Garrett founded his own imprint, Glow Hill Records, for which he recorded backed by Sir Stan and the Counts, and he later fronted his Cross Road Band on subsequent projects.[2][6] Musically he is associated with styles ranging from northern soul and retro‑soul to modern electric blues and contemporary blues, blending gospel‑honed vocals with West Coast R&B grooves.[3][4] Though never a mainstream star, his body of work and enduring cult following—especially among northern soul and deep‑soul collectors—have secured him a lasting place in the history of Los Angeles soul and blues.[2][3][4]

## Fun Facts
- As a boy in Omaha, Garrett eagerly volunteered to start Sunday school with a song when other children were too shy, effectively giving himself a weekly solo spot and early stage training.[1]
- Before turning professional, he repeatedly won a Los Angeles club talent show at the Brass Rail so often that comedian Leroy “Skillet” urged him to stop competing and become a featured performer instead.[1]
- While touring the Bay Area with his group, money was so tight that Jewel steered their car across town while Garrett and guitarist Claude pushed it part of the way just to make it to the club, a story he later recalled with humor.[1]
- Garrett and Jewel became so successful as a performing and recording team that they were able to build their own 32‑unit apartment building from the proceeds of their music work.[1]
