## Biography
Merry Clayton, born December 25, 1948, in Gert Town, New Orleans, Louisiana, emerged from a deeply musical and spiritual upbringing—her father was Reverend A.G. Williams Clayton, Sr., and she spent her early years singing gospel at New Zion Baptist Church. After her family relocated to Los Angeles, Clayton's prodigious talent was nurtured in local church choirs and by members of the influential vocal group The Blossoms, who introduced her to the world of studio recording while she was still a teenager.

Clayton began her professional career at just 14, recording a duet with Bobby Darin and releasing the first version of 'The Shoop Shoop Song (It's in His Kiss).' She soon became a sought-after session and background vocalist, most famously providing the searing duet vocals alongside Mick Jagger on The Rolling Stones' 'Gimme Shelter,' a performance now considered iconic in rock history. Her powerful, emotionally charged voice also graced recordings by Ray Charles (as a member of The Raelettes), Neil Young, Carole King, and many others, while she pursued a solo career with albums like 'Gimme Shelter' and collaborations on projects such as 'Dylan’s Gospel.'

Clayton's musical style is rooted in gospel, soul, and classic rock, characterized by her commanding vocal presence and ability to convey deep emotion. Her legacy, once largely behind the scenes, was brought to the forefront by the documentary '20 Feet From Stardom,' which celebrated the vital contributions of background singers and earned her long-overdue recognition as a foundational figure in American music.

## Fun Facts

- Her father would only allow her to see Ray Charles perform live, reflecting his protective nature and respect for Charles as a musician.
- Clayton's performance on 'Gimme Shelter' was recorded late at night while she was pregnant; the intensity of her vocals is legendary, and her voice cracked on a high note, which was kept in the final mix.
