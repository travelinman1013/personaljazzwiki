## Biography
Clifford Hayes' Louisville Stompers was a prominent jug band ensemble led by Clifford George Hayes, an influential African-American multi-instrumentalist born in Green County, Kentucky, in 1893. Hayes, who played violin, piano, and saxophone, grew up in a musical family and began performing in the early 1900s with the Hayes Family Band before moving to Louisville, Kentucky. His early exposure to both rural and urban musical traditions shaped his distinctive style, blending ragtime, country blues, and early jazz.

Hayes became a central figure in the Louisville jug band scene, joining Earl McDonald's Louisville Jug Band in 1913 and later forming his own groups, including the Dixieland Jug Blowers and Clifford's Louisville Jug Band. In 1927, he established the Louisville Stompers, shifting focus from jug-driven music to a more jazz-oriented sound, sometimes omitting the jug entirely. The Stompers recorded notable tracks between 1927 and 1929, with celebrated musicians like pianist Earl Hines contributing to their sessions. Hayes was known for his leadership, arranging skills, and ability to bridge the worlds of blues, ragtime, and jazz, leaving a legacy that influenced both the jug band and early jazz movements.

Despite personal and professional controversies, including disputes with collaborators over credit and finances, Hayes remained a prolific recording artist until the early 1930s. His innovative approach and charismatic presence helped elevate the jug band genre, and his recordings are still prized by collectors. Hayes died in Chicago in 1941, but his work with the Louisville Stompers and other ensembles continues to be recognized as foundational in the evolution of American roots music.
