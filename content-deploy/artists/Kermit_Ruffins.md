## Biography
Kermit Ruffins, born December 19, 1964 in New Orleans, Louisiana, is a celebrated jazz trumpeter, singer, composer, and bandleader whose career has become synonymous with the vibrant musical culture of his hometown. Raised in the city’s Ninth Ward, Ruffins began playing trumpet in the eighth grade at Lawless Junior High School and continued his musical education at Joseph S. Clark High School in the Tremé neighborhood. Deeply influenced by the sounds of Louis Armstrong and Louis Jordan, Ruffins quickly developed a reputation for his bright, silvery trumpet tone and charismatic, off-the-cuff vocal style.

In 1983, while still in high school, Ruffins co-founded the Rebirth Brass Band, a group that would become pivotal in revitalizing New Orleans brass band traditions for a new generation. With Rebirth, Ruffins contributed original compositions such as 'Do Whatcha Wanna' and helped the band transition from street busking in the French Quarter to becoming a staple at local venues. After leaving Rebirth in the early 1990s, he formed the Barbeque Swingers, a traditional jazz quintet that fused his love of classic New Orleans jazz with his passion for cooking, often grilling for fans after shows. Ruffins’s discography includes acclaimed albums like 'World on a String,' '1533 St. Philip Street,' and 'Live at Vaughn’s,' and his live performances are known for their warmth, informality, and infectious joy.

Ruffins is widely credited with bringing traditional jazz out of formal settings like Preservation Hall and back into neighborhood clubs and street corners, helping to re-energize the genre and inspire younger audiences. His enduring legacy as a musician and cultural ambassador is marked by his commitment to community, his embrace of New Orleans traditions, and his role in mentoring and collaborating with both established and emerging artists.
