## Biography
Tina Turner, born Anna Mae Bullock on November 26, 1939, in Nutbush, Tennessee, USA, was the youngest daughter of Floyd Richard Bullock and Zelma Priscilla Bullock[1][3]. Her early life was marked by rural hardship, but she found solace in music, singing in her church choir. In 1956, she moved to St. Louis, where she met Ike Turner and joined his band, the Kings of Rhythm, in 1957. By 1960, she had adopted the stage name Tina Turner and, with Ike, formed the Ike & Tina Turner Revue, quickly becoming one of the most electrifying live acts of the era[1][3]. Their hits included "A Fool in Love," "River Deep – Mountain High," and the Grammy-winning "Proud Mary"[1][3]. Despite professional success, Tina endured years of abuse from Ike, eventually leaving him in 1976 and filing for divorce, a courageous act that marked the end of their turbulent personal and professional partnership[1].

After a period of struggle, Tina Turner staged one of the most remarkable comebacks in music history. Her 1984 album Private Dancer, featuring the global hit "What's Love Got to Do with It," catapulted her to superstardom as a solo artist, earning her multiple Grammy Awards and establishing her as the "Queen of Rock 'n' Roll"[1][2]. She continued to release successful albums, starred in films like Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, and embarked on record-breaking world tours. Turner's musical style blended rock, soul, R&B, and pop, characterized by her powerful, raspy voice and dynamic stage presence. She was celebrated for her resilience, reinvention, and influence on generations of performers. Turner officially retired from performing in 2009 but remained a cultural icon until her death on May 24, 2023, in Switzerland, where she had become a citizen in 2013[1][2]. Her legacy endures through her music, autobiographical works, and the hit musical Tina, which dramatizes her life story[1][2].

## Fun Facts
- Tina Turner became a Swiss citizen in 2013 and lived in Switzerland until her death[1].
- She is the first artist to have a top 40 hit in the UK in seven consecutive decades, thanks to her 2020 collaboration with Kygo[2].
- Turner's life story was dramatized in the 1993 film What's Love Got to Do with It, with Angela Bassett portraying her[1].
- She donated all proceeds from her 2006 charity single "Teach Me Again" with Elisa to UNICEF and the World Food Programme[2].
