## Biography
Jon Cleary, born August 11, 1962, in Cranbrook, Kent, England, is a British-born, New Orleans-based pianist, vocalist, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist renowned for his mastery of funk and R&B[1]. Growing up in a musical family—his father played guitar, and his uncle introduced him to New Orleans R&B records—Cleary was captivated by the sounds of Professor Longhair, Allen Toussaint, and other Crescent City legends from an early age[1][3]. He left formal education behind to pursue music, forming his first band, Delta Wing, at 16, and by 1981, he made a life-changing pilgrimage to New Orleans, where he began working as a painter at the Maple Leaf Bar before quickly transitioning to playing piano there[3][4]. Cleary’s deep immersion in the local scene led to session work with New Orleans greats like Earl King, Johnny Adams, and Dr. John, and he soon became a fixture in the city’s vibrant music community[2][4].

Cleary’s career took off in the late 1980s with the release of his debut album, Alligator Lips & Dirty Rice (1989), and he has since released several acclaimed records, both as a solo artist and with his band, The Absolute Monster Gentlemen[1][3]. His 2015 album Go Go Juice won a Grammy Award for Best Regional Roots Music Album, cementing his reputation as a leading exponent of New Orleans funk and R&B[1]. Cleary’s style is a dynamic fusion of traditional New Orleans piano, ’70s soul, gospel, funk, and Afro-Caribbean rhythms, always delivered with a fresh, contemporary edge[8]. He has toured globally with icons like Bonnie Raitt and Taj Mahal, and remains a beloved figure at local venues such as Tipitina’s and the Maple Leaf Bar, where he continues to draw crowds with his energetic performances[1][2]. Cleary’s legacy lies in his ability to honor the roots of New Orleans music while pushing its boundaries, ensuring its vitality for new generations[8].
