## Biography
Tommy Flanagan, born Thomas Lee Flanagan on March 16, 1930, in Detroit, Michigan, was a highly influential American jazz pianist and composer. Raised in Detroit’s vibrant Conant Gardens neighborhood, he began his musical journey on clarinet at age six before switching to piano at eleven. Immersed in Detroit’s fertile jazz scene, Flanagan made his professional debut at fifteen and played with future jazz luminaries such as Kenny Burrell and Elvin Jones. Early on, he was influenced by pianists Art Tatum, Teddy Wilson, Nat King Cole, and later by bebop innovators like Bud Powell, whose harmonic sophistication and rhythmic drive shaped Flanagan’s own lyrical and elegant style.

After serving in the U.S. Army during the Korean War, Flanagan returned to Detroit before relocating to New York City in 1956. There, he quickly established himself as a first-call pianist, recording with Miles Davis and contributing to landmark albums such as Sonny Rollins’ 'Saxophone Colossus,' John Coltrane’s 'Giant Steps,' and Wes Montgomery’s 'The Incredible Jazz Guitar.' In 1962, he became Ella Fitzgerald’s full-time accompanist and later her musical director, a collaboration that spanned over a decade and included extensive international tours. Flanagan also led his own acclaimed trios, particularly with bassist George Mraz and drummers Elvin Jones or Lewis Nash, and recorded more than three dozen albums as a leader while appearing on over 200 as a sideman.

Flanagan’s refined touch, melodic inventiveness, and deep understanding of jazz harmony earned him widespread admiration among peers and critics alike. He was especially noted for his interpretations of Billy Strayhorn, Thad Jones, and Tadd Dameron. His legacy endures through his recordings, his influence on generations of pianists, and his role in shaping the sound of modern jazz piano. He passed away on November 16, 2001, leaving behind a body of work that continues to inspire musicians worldwide.
