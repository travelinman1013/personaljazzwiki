## Biography
The Cotton Top Mountain Sanctified Singers were an American vocal group active in the late 1920s, known for their 1929 recordings captured in the Discography of American Historical Recordings (DAHR).[1] They specialized in gospel and sanctified music, blending elements of jazz and blues, as evidenced by their inclusion in early gospel compilations and holiday-themed tracks.[2][5][6] Little is documented about their formation or individual members' early lives, but they emerged during the pre-Depression era of sacred music recording, contributing to the sanctified singing tradition popular in African American communities.[1][2]

The group's career was brief, centered around their 1929 sessions, including the Christmas song 'Early on One Christmas Morn' (also known as 'Christ Was Born on Christmas Morn'), which featured vaudeville entertainer Frankie 'Half-Pint' Jaxon and trumpeter Ernie Punch Miller.[2][6][8] Their musical style mimicked mountain sanctified singing—raw, emotive gospel shouts—while incorporating jazz/blues influences from key performers, reflecting the era's fusion of sacred and secular sounds in Chicago and beyond.[2][6] They performed as a vocal group without specified instrumentation beyond occasional trumpet support.[1]

Their legacy endures in archival collections and reissues, influencing later folk and holiday recordings; Canadian singer-songwriter Bruce Cockburn adapted their Christmas track for his 1990 album 'Christmas,' highlighting its obscure yet haunting gospel roots.[6] With low modern popularity (Spotify score of 3), they represent a footnote in early gospel history, preserved through rare 78rpm records.[1][2]

## Fun Facts
- Recorded 'Early on One Christmas Morn' in 1929, a rousing gospel track later called one of the spookiest Christmas carols due to its eerie, ancient-style lyrics linking to Grail myths and fertility rites.[6]
- Featured in the 'Goodbye, Babylon' compilation alongside groups like Norfolk Jubilee Quartet and Foggy Mountain Boys, showcasing early 20th-century sacred music.[5]
- Their name evokes Appalachian 'cotton top' imagery, but the group operated in an urban jazz/blues context with Chicago-area performers.[2]
- A 1929 track 'Christ Was Born on Christmas Morn' paired them with Bessie Smith in holiday playlists, bridging gospel and blues Christmas traditions.[8]
