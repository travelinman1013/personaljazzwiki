## Biography
Big Walter Horton, born Walter Horton on April 6, 1918 (some sources cite 1917 or 1921) in Horn Lake, Mississippi, emerged as one of the most influential blues harmonica players of the 20th century. Raised near Memphis, he began teaching himself harmonica at the age of five, using a gift from his father and even blowing into tin cans as a child to create sounds. Horton left school early due to nystagmus, a condition that caused involuntary head shaking and learning difficulties, earning him the nickname 'Shakey.' By his early teens, he was performing on Memphis streets and parks, collaborating with local musicians and earning tips to support himself.[2][4]

In the 1930s, Horton played with various blues artists across the Mississippi Delta, and his first documented recordings were made in 1939 in Memphis, backing guitarist Little Buddy Doyle. After a period away from music due to poor health in the 1940s, Horton returned in the early 1950s, recording for Sam Phillips at Sun Records. He soon moved to Chicago, where he became a key figure in the city's blues scene, working with legends such as Muddy Waters, Jimmy Rogers, Otis Rush, and Willie Dixon. Horton's amplified harmonica style, marked by a horn-like tone and virtuosic phrasing, helped define the Chicago blues sound. Despite his shyness and preference for sideman roles, his influence was profound, and he continued to perform and record into the 1970s, including a notable appearance in the film 'The Blues Brothers.' Horton died of heart failure in Chicago in 1981 and was posthumously inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame.[2][4][5]

Horton's legacy endures through his innovative harmonica techniques and his impact on generations of blues musicians. His recordings and live performances remain touchstones for harmonica players worldwide, and he is often cited by peers and successors as a master of the instrument. Willie Dixon, a longtime friend and collaborator, famously called him 'the best harmonica player I ever heard.'[2][3][5]
