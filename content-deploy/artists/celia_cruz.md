## Biography
Celia Cruz, born Úrsula Hilaria Celia de la Caridad Cruz Alfonso on October 21, 1925, in Havana, Cuba, rose from humble beginnings to become one of the most influential and celebrated voices in Latin music. Encouraged by her family, she studied music at Havana’s National Conservatory and began her career singing in cabarets and on radio shows as a teenager. Her breakthrough came in 1950 when she became the lead singer of La Sonora Matancera, Cuba’s most popular orchestra, marking the start of a prolific partnership that brought her international acclaim and made her the ensemble’s first Black front person[2][7].

After the Cuban Revolution, Cruz left Cuba in 1961, settling in the United States with her husband and musical director, Pedro Knight. She continued to tour with La Sonora Matancera before launching a solo career that would define the sound of salsa. In the 1970s, Cruz joined Fania Records, collaborating with salsa luminaries like Johnny Pacheco, Willie Colón, and the Fania All-Stars, and became known for her powerful operatic voice, improvisational flair, and exuberant stage presence[1][4][6]. Her signature exclamation, “¡Azúcar!” (“Sugar!”), became a symbol of her joyful spirit and the vibrancy of salsa music[4].

Cruz’s musical style blended Afro-Cuban rhythms, son, bolero, mambo, and later salsa, helping to popularize Latin music worldwide. Over her career, she recorded more than 80 albums, earned 23 gold records, and won multiple Grammy and Latin Grammy Awards. Her legacy endures as the “Queen of Salsa,” a trailblazer who broke barriers for Afro-Latin artists and inspired generations with her artistry, charisma, and cultural pride[2][5][8].
