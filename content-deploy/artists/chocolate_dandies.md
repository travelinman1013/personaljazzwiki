# CHOCOLATE DANDIES

## Biography
The Chocolate Dandies emerged in the late 1920s as a pseudonym for a small ensemble drawn from McKinney's Cotton Pickers, initially recording nine songs in July 1928 under this name, inspired by the 1924 Broadway show co-written by Eubie Blake and Noble Sissle. Led by Don Redman—who opted not to have his name on the labels—the group featured top-tier jazz talent including Rex Stewart, J.C. Higginbotham, Benny Carter, Coleman Hawkins, and Fats Waller, marking their debut with innovative tracks on the Okeh label. Additional sessions in October 1928, including 'Birmingham Breakdown' and 'Stardust,' established their progressive sound characterized by original arrangements, dual solos, and experimental approaches like drumless recordings.[1][2][3]

Throughout the 1930s and into the 1940s, the Chocolate Dandies name was adopted by multiple jazz ensembles, notably those led by Benny Carter, who recorded with Coleman Hawkins and later incorporated members like Max Kaminsky, Floyd O’Brien, Buck Clayton, and musicians from Fletcher Henderson's and Carter's bands. Their style evolved within big band and swing genres, pushing boundaries with feats such as Carter's multi-instrumental performances on alto sax and trumpet in the 1940 recording 'Smack.' These groups represented a 'ragtag' outfit refined to professional standards by leaders like Redman and Carter, blending hot jazz innovation with sophisticated arrangements.[1][2][3]

Though not a fixed band, the Chocolate Dandies left a lasting legacy in jazz history for their ahead-of-their-time ideas and stellar personnel, influencing the transition from 1920s hot jazz to swing-era big bands. Their recordings remain celebrated for pioneering musical designs that showcased emerging stars and experimental flair.[1][6]

## Fun Facts
- The name originated from the 1924 Broadway show 'Chocolate Dandies' by Eubie Blake and Noble Sissle, later used as a pseudonym to bypass recording contract clauses common in the 1920s jazz scene.
- Don Redman deliberately omitted his name from early record labels despite leading the group, before achieving fame with his own bands.
- Benny Carter played both alto saxophone and trumpet on the 1940 recording 'Smack,' showcasing innovative multi-instrumentalism.
- The group sometimes recorded without drums and featured dual sax-trumpet solos, ideas considered ahead of their time.
