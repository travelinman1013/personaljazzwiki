## Biography
Grayson Capps, born April 17, 1967 in Opelika, Alabama, is a celebrated American singer-songwriter whose work is deeply rooted in the traditions of Americana and alt-country. Raised in a musical household, Capps was surrounded by the sounds of his father and friends playing classic country and folk songs, experiences that would later shape his narrative-driven songwriting. He attended Tulane University in New Orleans on a theater scholarship, where he formed his first bands, The House Levelers and the blues-influenced Stavin' Chain, both of which achieved moderate national success and opened for acts like Keith Richards and The Replacements.

After the dissolution of his early bands, Capps embarked on a solo career, drawing inspiration from the gritty realities of Southern life. His music often features characters on society’s fringes, blending Southern soul, back-country stomp, and roadhouse blues. Capps' storytelling prowess caught wider attention when several of his songs were featured in the 2004 film 'A Love Song for Bobby Long,' based on his father's unpublished novel. He released his debut solo album, 'If You Knew My Mind,' in 2005, followed by a series of acclaimed records including 'Wail & Ride,' 'Rott 'n' Roll,' and projects with bands like The Stumpknockers and The Lost Cause Minstrels. Though based in New Orleans for many years, Hurricane Katrina forced him to relocate, eventually settling back in Alabama, where he continues to write, record, and perform.

Capps is recognized for his raw, poetic lyricism and his ability to channel the spirit of the American South. His influence extends beyond his own recordings, as he has become a respected figure in the roots music community, known for his marathon live performances and his dedication to the authenticity of Southern storytelling.
