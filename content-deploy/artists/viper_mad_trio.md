## Biography
Viper Mad Trio is a contemporary traditional‑jazz and ragtime‑influenced group led by guitarist and vocalist **Ms. Reeves**, with **Kellan Garcia** on bass and **Ryan Robertson** on trumpet.[5] The ensemble’s name references the classic early‑jazz tune “Viper Mad,” signaling their orientation toward pre‑bebop swing, New Orleans, and ragtime idioms rather than modern jazz or fusion.[4][5] Emerging on the North American jazz scene in the 2010s/2020s, the trio positions itself within the broader revival of early jazz, blending historically rooted repertoire and techniques with a modern small‑group aesthetic.[5]

Critics have noted that the trio’s sound centers on Ms. Reeves’ guitar and vocals, supported by Garcia’s solid, melodic bass lines and Robertson’s bright, assertive trumpet playing.[5] Their work is characterized by concise arrangements, attention to period style, and an interest in material associated with Buddy Bolden and other early New Orleans figures, as suggested by the album *Buddy Bolden’s Blues*.[5] Operating primarily as a small ensemble rather than a rotating collective, Viper Mad Trio focuses on intimate club dates and recordings that emphasize interplay and ensemble balance, contributing modestly but authentically to the ongoing preservation and reinterpretation of ragtime and early jazz traditions.[5]

Because Viper Mad Trio is a relatively low‑profile group with limited mainstream coverage, detailed documentation of their formation, individual member biographies, and long‑term impact is scarce in publicly available sources.[5] Existing reviews and notices, however, consistently place them within the ragtime/trad‑jazz niche and highlight their commitment to early‑jazz repertoire and performance practice, making them part of the current generation of musicians keeping this repertoire in active circulation.[5]

## Fun Facts
- The group’s name is taken from the early‑jazz song “Viper Mad,” a tune associated with 1930s swing and cannabis‑culture slang, signaling the band’s stylistic allegiance to classic jazz.[4][5]
- A review of *Buddy Bolden’s Blues* highlights Viper Mad Trio as a guitar‑, bass‑, and trumpet‑based group, rather than the more typical piano‑ or drum‑anchored traditional‑jazz lineup.[5]
- Despite working in a historically oriented ragtime/early‑jazz niche, the trio has attracted critical attention in specialist jazz publications, which praise their authenticity and ensemble cohesion.[5]
