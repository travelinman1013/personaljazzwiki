## Biography
Jillian Rose Banks, known professionally as BANKS (often stylized in all caps), was born on June 16, 1988, in Orange County, California, and moved to Los Angeles at a young age, settling in the Tarzana neighborhood of the San Fernando Valley. She began writing songs at age 15 and taught herself piano on a keyboard gifted by a friend during her parents' divorce, marking the start of her musical journey. While attending the University of Southern California (USC), she connected with manager DJ Yung Skeeter, who introduced her to Good Years Recordings; her track 'Before I Ever Met You' gained traction after being played by DJ Zane Lowe on BBC Radio 1 in 2013, leading to her debut EPs *Fall Over* and *London* that year.[1][2][3]

BANKS signed with Harvest Records and released her debut album *Goddess* in 2014, which peaked at number 12 on the Billboard 200 and featured the platinum-certified single 'Beggin for Thread,' earning widespread critical acclaim for her magnetic songwriting. She supported The Weeknd on tour twice, performed at festivals like Coachella and Bonnaroo, and followed with *The Altar* (2016, peaking at #17) and *III* (2019, peaking at #21, her most critically acclaimed work). Departing Harvest, she went independent for *Serpentina* (2022), embracing experimental sounds, and released *Off with Her Head* in 2025. Her style blends alternative R&B, pop, and electronic elements with introspective, emotionally raw lyrics.[1][2][3][4]

BANKS's career highlights include headlining tours like The Goddess Tour (2014–2015) and The Serpentina Tour (2022), as well as opening for artists like Lana Del Rey in 2025. Known for overcoming severe stage fright—early performances faced away from audiences—she has evolved into a confident live performer, influencing contemporary pop with her genre-bending production and instinctive creative process.[1][4][5]
