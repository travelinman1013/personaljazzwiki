## Biography
Redbone is an American rock band formed in Los Angeles, California, in 1969 by brothers Pat and Lolly Vegas, both of Yaqui, Shoshone, and Mexican descent. Before founding Redbone, the Vegas brothers had established themselves as respected studio musicians on the Los Angeles scene, working with artists such as Tina Turner, James Brown, and Elvis Presley. Their early musical experiences and desire to celebrate their Native American heritage led them to form Redbone, a name inspired by a slang term for people of mixed Native American and European ancestry. The original lineup included Pat Vegas (bass, vocals), Lolly Vegas (guitar, sitar, vocals), Tony Bellamy (guitar, vocals), and Peter DePoe (drums).

Redbone's music is characterized by a fusion of rock, funk, R&B, and Native American musical elements, reflected in their songs, stage regalia, and album art. The band achieved mainstream success in the early 1970s, most notably with their 1974 hit single "Come and Get Your Love," which reached number 5 on the Billboard Hot 100 and sold over a million copies. Other notable tracks include "The Witch Queen of New Orleans," "Wovoka," and "We Were All Wounded at Wounded Knee," the latter of which was controversial in the U.S. but became a number one hit in Europe. Redbone's willingness to address Native American issues in their music and public persona made them pioneers in bringing indigenous identity to mainstream rock.

Despite facing industry challenges and prejudice, Redbone's legacy endures as the most successful Native American rock group in history. Their music continues to inspire new generations, and the band remains active under the leadership of Pat Vegas following the deaths of Tony Bellamy in 2009 and Lolly Vegas in 2010. Their story is recognized as a significant chapter in both American music and Native American cultural history.
