## Biography
Herbie Mann with Cissy Houston refers to a notable collaboration between jazz flutist **Herbie Mann** (born Herbert Jay Solomon in Brooklyn, New York, 1930) and renowned session vocalist and gospel singer **Cissy Houston** (born Emily Drinkard in Newark, New Jersey, 1933) during the mid-1970s. Mann, an innovative jazz musician who pioneered world music influences in jazz and played flute, tenor saxophone, and clarinet, began his career after military service in the early 1950s, gaining fame with albums like *Memphis Underground* (1969) that blended jazz with soul, funk, and disco. Houston, from a musical family including nieces Dionne Warwick and Dee Dee Warwick, started in gospel with the Drinkard Singers before becoming a top session singer in the 1960s with the Sweet Inspirations, backing artists like Aretha Franklin, and launching a solo career in 1970.[1][2][4][7]

Their partnership peaked in 1975-1976 on Mann's Atlantic Records albums *Discothèque* (1975), *Waterbed* (1975), and *Surprises* (1976), where Houston provided powerful backing vocals on tracks like 'Violet Don't Be Blue,' 'Cajun Moon,' and 'Easter Rising.' This period marked Mann's fusion of jazz flute with funky disco and soul, featuring elite session players, while Houston transitioned from her Sweet Inspirations tenure and Janus Records solo work (*Presenting Cissy Houston*, 1970) into jazz-funk collaborations. Houston's rich, soulful voice complemented Mann's experimental style, bridging gospel roots with secular jazz innovation during a time when Mann faced criticism from jazz purists but sustained popularity.[1][3][4]

Mann's legacy endures as a world music jazz trailblazer until his death in 2003, while Houston continued session work, gospel leadership at New Hope Baptist Church, and family mentorship, including guiding daughter Whitney Houston's career; she passed in 2024. Their joint albums highlight a unique fusion era, blending Mann's global jazz flute with Houston's gospel-soul vocals.[1][2][4]
