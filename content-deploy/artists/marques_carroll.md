## Biography
Marques Carroll, a Chicago-based trumpeter, composer, and educator, was born in Los Angeles and raised in St. Louis in a musical family. He began playing the trumpet at age 8, inspired by his grandfather who worked with jazz legend Clark Terry, and developed early influences from artists like Louis Armstrong, Miles Davis, Wynton Marsalis, and classical composers such as Bach and Beethoven. Carroll earned Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Jazz Studies Performance from DePaul University, honing a versatile style rooted in Black American Music while challenging genre norms in blues, funk, soul, neo-soul, and hip-hop.[1][2][5]

Professionally active for over 25 years since drawing national attention in 1996, Carroll has performed with luminaries including Carmen Bradford, Dee Dee Bridgewater, Christian McBride, Jon Faddis, Randy Brecker, Nicholas Payton, Jimmy Heath, the Count Basie Orchestra, The Temptations, and Aretha Franklin. He co-founded JMarq Records, leading his self-titled quintet on albums like the Grammy-considered *The Ancestors’ Call* (2020) and *Foundations*, and the Trumpet Summit's live album *In Stride We Keep Steppin*. As co-leader of the Chicago Soul Jazz Collective, he has released three studio albums. During the pandemic, he left music education to focus on his label and solo projects, placing songs in TV show *The Bear* and contributing to Emmy-winning documentary *Invisible History: Middle Florida’s Hidden Roots*.[1][2][3]

A passionate educator since 2007, Carroll serves as Musical Director for Chicago Jesuit Academy, Jazz Trumpet Professor at the University of Chicago, and leads community programs like the Black American Music Ensemble, helping hundreds of young men through music in Chicago's toughest areas. His legacy blends performance mastery, innovative composition, and social impact, preserving jazz traditions while expanding their reach.[1][3][4]
