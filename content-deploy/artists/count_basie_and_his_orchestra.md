## Biography
Count Basie and His Orchestra, founded in 1935 by pianist and bandleader William James 'Count' Basie (born August 21, 1904, in Red Bank, New Jersey), emerged from the vibrant Kansas City jazz scene. Basie arrived in Kansas City in 1927, playing with Walter Page's Blue Devils and later joining Bennie Moten's band in 1929 as staff arranger and substitute pianist. After Moten's death in 1935, Basie formed his own nine-piece group, the Barons of Rhythm, which gained national attention through Reno Club radio broadcasts. Discovered by John Hammond in 1936, the band expanded to a 13-piece big band, moved to New York, and recorded hits like 'One O'Clock Jump' and 'Jumpin' at the Woodside' with Decca, defining the swing era with riff-based accompaniments, extended solos, and a light, blues-infused style contrasting denser East Coast jazz.[1][2][3]

Financial issues led to a disbandment in 1950, after which Basie led smaller groups before reforming the orchestra in 1952 as the 'New Testament Band.' This era featured international tours, collaborations with singers like Joe Williams, Frank Sinatra, and Ella Fitzgerald, and arrangements by Neal Hefti, Quincy Jones, and Sammy Nestico. The band emphasized the rhythm section, split tenor saxophones, and encouraged original compositions from members like Thad Jones and Frank Wess, who recorded the first jazz flute solo. Basie led for nearly 50 years, recording over 480 albums until his death in 1984, with the orchestra continuing today under directors like Scotty Barnhart.[1][2][4]

Basie's legacy as the 'King of Swing' lies in pioneering big band swing by fusing blues and jazz, prioritizing ensemble riffs over dense arrangements, and fostering soloist freedom. His understated piano playing and precise leadership influenced mid-20th-century popular music, earning 18 Grammy Awards for the enduring orchestra and establishing standards emulated by jazz bands worldwide.[2][4][5]

## Fun Facts
- Basie earned his 'Count' nickname from a vaudeville performer who dubbed him 'Count' Basie while he accompanied silent films on piano, mimicking the style of European nobility.
- The band's signature tune 'One O'Clock Jump' was spontaneously created during a 1937 radio broadcast when Basie couldn't remember the planned song and signaled the band to riff.
- After Bennie Moten's 1935 death during surgery, Basie took over many of his musicians to form the Barons of Rhythm, including scheming his way into the top spot as arranger.
- The orchestra's Reno Club broadcasts were cut short at 1 AM each night, inspiring the name of their hit 'One O'Clock Jump.'
