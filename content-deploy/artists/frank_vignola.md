## Biography
Frank Vignola (born December 30, 1965) is an American jazz guitarist celebrated for his dazzling technique and stylistic versatility across swing, gypsy jazz, fusion, classical, and pop settings.[1][7] He grew up on Long Island, New York, in a musical family; his father played accordion and banjo and taught him guitar from age five, while records by Django Reinhardt, Bucky Pizzarelli, Joe Pass, and Johnny Smith shaped his early ear.[1][7] At twelve he took up the banjo and, only two years later, won a national banjo championship in Canada, signaling the speed and facility that would later define his guitar work.[1] In his early twenties he formed the Hot Club Quintet (1987), modeled on the Quintette du Hot Club de France, and soon became a fixture on the New York scene, working with stride pianist Max Morath, violinist Andy Stein, pianist Herman Foster, drummer Joe Ascione, and tuba player Sam Pilafian.[1]

Through the 1990s and 2000s Vignola built a wide‑ranging career as both leader and sideman, recording for labels such as Concord Jazz and Telarc and co‑founding the Concord Jazz Guitar Collective with Howard Alden and Jimmy Bruno.[1] His résumé spans work with Leon Redbone, Mark O’Connor, the Boston Pops, the New York Pops, Wynton Marsalis, Bucky Pizzarelli, Gene Bertoncini, Joey DeFrancesco, Jane Monheit, Donald Fagen, Madonna, Ringo Starr, and Tommy Emmanuel, among many others, leading the New York Times to describe him as “one of the brightest stars of the guitar.”[1][5][7][8] A longtime collaborator and friend of Les Paul, Vignola played regularly at New York’s Iridium Jazz Club, where Les Paul held his legendary Monday‑night residency, and Paul later named Vignola among his five most admired guitarists in the Wall Street Journal.[3][5] After a life‑threatening ATV accident in May 2017 that left him with multiple fractures and collapsed lungs, Vignola endured several surgeries and intensive rehabilitation before returning to the stage in 2018, channeling his recovery time into new three‑guitar arrangements and expanding his extensive body of educational books, videos, and online courses.[1][3] Today he is regarded not only as a virtuoso performer but also as a key modern ambassador of swing and gypsy‑influenced jazz guitar, with an enduring legacy built on concert work, recordings, and pedagogy.[3][5][7][8]

## Fun Facts
- Before becoming known as a jazz guitar virtuoso, Frank Vignola won a national banjo championship in Canada at just fourteen years old.[1]
- He formed his first notable group, the Hot Club Quintet, at age 23 in 1987, explicitly modeled on Django Reinhardt’s Quintette du Hot Club de France.[1]
- Les Paul was such an admirer of Vignola’s playing that he listed Frank among his five most admired guitarists in a Wall Street Journal feature.[5]
- After a 2017 ATV accident that broke his right shoulder and arm, four ribs, and collapsed both lungs, Vignola was initially told he might never play again, but he returned to the stage within about a year and used his recovery time to write roughly 25 new three‑guitar arrangements.[1][3]
