## Biography
Maurice 'Mobetta' Brown is a Grammy Award-winning trumpeter, composer, arranger, and producer, celebrated for his dynamic presence across jazz, blues-rock, and hip-hop. Born on January 6, 1981, in Harvey, Illinois, Brown showed early promise on the trumpet, winning the prestigious national Miles Davis Trumpet Competition as a teenager. He studied under legendary clarinetist Alvin Batiste at Southern University in Louisiana, after beginning his studies at Northern Illinois University. Brown's debut album, 'Hip to Bop,' recorded in New Orleans, established his reputation for blending be-bop with contemporary jazz influences.

After Hurricane Katrina, Brown relocated first to Chicago and then to Brooklyn, New York, where he continued to evolve his sound and collaborate with a wide range of artists. He formed his own quintet, revived his hip-hop/funk group Soul'd U Out, and worked with luminaries such as Aretha Franklin, Wyclef Jean, De La Soul, Macy Gray, Dr. Lonnie Smith, Lettuce, and The Roots. His album 'The Cycle of Love' received critical acclaim, with NPR and Huffington Post naming it among the best records of the year. Brown's versatility led him to join the Tedeschi Trucks Band, where he arranged horns for their Grammy-winning debut album 'Revelator.'

Brown's musical style is defined by a seamless fusion of jazz improvisation, hip-hop rhythms, and soulful melodies. His 2014 project 'Maurice vs. Mobetta' showcased his alter-ego as a rapper and producer, remixing jazz horn lines with hip-hop beats and featuring collaborations with Talib Kweli, Prodigy, and Jean Grae. Brown continues to push boundaries, producing and performing across genres while inspiring a new generation of musicians with his innovative approach.
