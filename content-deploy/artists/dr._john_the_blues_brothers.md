## Biography
Malcolm John Rebennack Jr., known professionally as Dr. John, was born in New Orleans in 1941. Raised in a musical environment—his father owned a record and equipment shop—he was exposed early to the rich traditions of New Orleans R&B, blues, and jazz. He began playing guitar at age seven, studying under local legends Walter 'Papoose' Nelson and Roy Montrell, both of whom played with Fats Domino. As a teenager, Dr. John worked as a session musician at Cosimo Matassa’s J&M Studio, collaborating with artists like Frankie Ford, Joe Tex, and Professor Longhair. His early career was marked by both musical innovation and personal turbulence, including a gunshot injury that shifted his focus from guitar to piano, and a period of incarceration for drug offenses that led him to relocate to Los Angeles in the mid-1960s.

In Los Angeles, Dr. John became a sought-after session musician, contributing to recordings by Sonny & Cher, Canned Heat, and Frank Zappa, among many others. He developed his signature persona, 'Dr. John the Night Tripper,' blending New Orleans musical traditions with theatrical stagecraft inspired by Mardi Gras, voodoo, and medicine shows. His 1968 debut album 'Gris-Gris' established him as a unique voice in American music, and he achieved mainstream success with the 1973 hit 'Right Place, Wrong Time.' Over his five-decade career, Dr. John recorded over thirty studio albums, won six Grammy Awards, and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2011. His music fused New Orleans R&B, jazz, funk, zydeco, and soul, and he remained a vital ambassador for his city's musical heritage until his death in 2019.

Dr. John's legacy is that of a flamboyant cultural icon and a masterful musician who bridged generations and genres. His influence is evident in the continued popularity of New Orleans music worldwide, and in the many artists who cite him as an inspiration. His persona, musical style, and commitment to the traditions of his hometown have ensured his place as one of the most important figures in American roots music.
