## Biography
Gene Harris (born Eugene Haire, September 1, 1933 – January 16, 2000) was an American jazz pianist born in Benton Harbor, Michigan, who became one of the most accessible and influential soul jazz musicians of his era. He began teaching himself piano at age six and later served in the Army from 1951 to 1954, where he played in military bands that accelerated his musical development. In 1956, Harris formed The Three Sounds trio with bassist Andy Simpkins and drummer Bill Dowdy, initially as The Four Sounds before saxophonist Lonnie "The Sound" Walker departed. This ensemble became one of the preeminent soul and jazz piano trios of the mid-1950s through 1960s, recording exclusively for Blue Note Records between 1958 and 1962—a period during which no other Blue Note act sold as many records as The Three Sounds.

Harris' musical style was characterized by a warm, soulful sound deeply rooted in blues and gospel traditions, influenced by pianists Oscar Peterson and Art Tatum, and seasoned with the blues-iness of Junior Mance. His playing was marked by melodic accessibility, sophisticated chord voicings flavored with church music, and an ability to create lively connections with audiences. During The Three Sounds' 15-year tenure together, the trio recorded prolifically for Blue Note, Verve, Mercury, and Limelight Records, while also collaborating with jazz luminaries including Lester Young, Sonny Stitt, Stanley Turrentine, Johnny Griffin, Anita O'Day, Lou Donaldson, and Nat Adderley. After The Three Sounds disbanded in 1973, Harris pursued a solo career and retired to Boise, Idaho in 1977, where he became a local celebrity performing at Peter Schott's restaurant in the Idanha Hotel.

Harris' retirement proved short-lived when vibraphonist Milt Jackson invited him to record "Soul Route" in 1984, sparking a fruitful collaboration with bassist Ray Brown and leading to his association with Concord Records. Over his final 23 years, he released 22 albums and returned to touring in the 1980s, earning a Grammy nomination in 1988 for his album "Tribute to Count Basie." Harris died on January 16, 2000, at age 66, leaving behind a legacy celebrated for his capacity to connect with listeners and his significant contributions to the history of recorded jazz. The LA Times noted that "the real heart of his music was its capacity to create a lively connection with his listeners, many of whom were dedicated fans for decades."
