## Biography
Beau Jocque, born Andrus Espre on November 1, 1953, in Duralde, Louisiana, began his musical journey far from the zydeco genre.  His father, a respected accordion player, influenced his early life, though he quit playing music before Andrus's older brother was born.  Andrus played guitar in a high school band, but his musical influences were diverse, encompassing acts like War, ZZ Top, Stevie Ray Vaughan, James Brown, Sly and the Family Stone, and Santana, rather than zydeco artists.  After high school, he served nine years in the Air Force, reaching the rank of sergeant and even escorting Henry Kissinger during his time stationed in London and Germany.  A near-death experience involving an explosion resulted in temporary amnesia. Following his military service, he worked as an electrician and welder, and later in an oil refinery, where a work-related accident in 1987 temporarily paralyzed him from the waist down.

His recovery marked a turning point.  As part of his physical therapy, Espre began playing his father's button accordion.  He and his wife, Michelle (Shelly), studied the styles of prominent zydeco acts like C. J. Chenier, Buckwheat Zydeco, Boozoo Chavis, and John Delafose, focusing on what moved audiences.  Adopting the stage name "Beau Jocque," meaning "Big Guy" in Louisiana Creole, reflecting his 6'6", 270-pound frame, he formed a band in 1991, including Shelly on rubboard.  Their initial gigs led to a rapid rise in popularity, fueled by Beau Jocque's unique fusion of zydeco with rock guitar solos, blues-rock beats, and rap elements, all delivered with his powerful bass vocals and growling lyrics.  His 1992 debut album, *My Name is Beau Jocque*, quickly sold out, leading to a deal with Rounder Records.  His 1993 album, *Beau Jocque Boogie*, featuring the hit song "Give Him Cornbread," became the highest-selling zydeco album ever.  He went on to record five more studio albums for Rounder, plus a live album and compilations, all commercially successful.  He also recorded for Mardi Gras Records and his own label.  In 1995, he headlined the Rounder Records "Louisiana Red Hot Music Tour" and won three Big Easy Music Awards for Best Zydeco Artist.

Beau Jocque's musical style was a groundbreaking fusion of zydeco with rock, blues, and hip hop elements.  His powerful vocals and energetic performances, backed by the Hi-Rollers, captivated audiences and established him as a leading figure in the zydeco scene.  His innovative approach, incorporating elements from diverse genres, appealed particularly to younger audiences.  However, his rapid success led to some tension with established zydeco musicians, notably a publicized but ultimately friendly rivalry with Boozoo Chavis, culminating in annual "Boo vs. Beau" battles at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, even attracting Mick Jagger and Charlie Watts of The Rolling Stones as attendees.  The rivalry, documented in the 1994 film *The Kingdom of Zydeco*, was ultimately a promotional success for both artists.  Beau Jocque's legacy lies in his revitalization of zydeco music, broadening its appeal and influencing a new generation of musicians.  His untimely death from an apparent heart attack on September 10, 1999, at the peak of his career, cut short a remarkable musical journey.
