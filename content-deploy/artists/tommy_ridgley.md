## Biography
Tommy Ridgley, born Thomas Herman Ridgley on October 30, 1925, in the Shrewsbury district of New Orleans, was a pivotal figure in the city’s Rhythm & Blues scene for over five decades. Raised in a musical family and singing in the church choir, Ridgley’s early exposure to music shaped his smooth vocal style and affinity for blues and ballads. After serving in the Navy during World War II, he returned to New Orleans and began studying music, soon drawing inspiration from local R&B luminary Roy Brown. Ridgley’s professional break came in 1949 with the release of “Shrewsbury Blues” and “Early Dawn Boogie” on Imperial Records, produced by Dave Bartholomew, which established him as a key progenitor of New Orleans jump blues and R&B.

Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, Ridgley recorded for major labels such as Decca, Atlantic, Herald, Ric, and Ron, consistently producing regional hits though never achieving a major national breakthrough. He formed his own band, The Untouchables, which became the celebrated house band at the legendary Dew Drop Inn, backing and opening for stars like James Brown, Ray Charles, Sam Cooke, and Little Richard. Ridgley’s style blended blues, R&B, and the emerging sounds of soul, and his reputation as a bandleader and songwriter made him a cornerstone of New Orleans music. Despite shifts in popular music, Ridgley’s career endured, with renewed recognition during the revival of New Orleans R&B in the 1970s and continued performances at festivals and clubs until his death in 1999. His legacy is marked by over 70 recordings and his influence on the city’s musical landscape.
