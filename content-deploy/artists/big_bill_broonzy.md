## Biography
Big Bill Broonzy, born Lee Conley Bradley (with sources differing on whether he was born in 1893 in Scott, Mississippi or 1903 near Lake Dick, Arkansas), was one of the most influential figures in 20th-century blues. Raised in a large family in rural Arkansas, Broonzy began his musical journey playing fiddle at church and local gatherings before moving to Chicago in the early 1920s. There, he transitioned from fiddle to guitar and immersed himself in the city's burgeoning blues scene, initially performing as an accompanist before establishing himself as a solo artist.[1][3][8]

Broonzy's career spanned over three decades, during which he recorded more than 250 songs and adapted his style from rural country blues to the more urban, jazz-inflected Chicago blues sound of the 1930s and 1940s. His songwriting, which often reflected his own journey from the rural South to the urban North, produced classics such as "Key to the Highway," "Black, Brown and White," and "All by Myself." In the 1950s, Broonzy became a prominent figure in the American folk revival, touring Europe and introducing international audiences to authentic blues. He was also a key participant in the historic 1938 "From Spirituals to Swing" concert at Carnegie Hall, further cementing his legacy as a blues ambassador.[1][2][4][5]

Broonzy's influence extended well beyond his recordings. He mentored younger musicians like Muddy Waters and Memphis Slim, and his work inspired later generations of blues and rock artists, including Eric Clapton and Keith Richards. His autobiography, "Big Bill Blues," published in 1955, remains a valuable firsthand account of the blues tradition. Broonzy passed away in Chicago in 1958, but his impact on blues and popular music endures.[1][2][4]
