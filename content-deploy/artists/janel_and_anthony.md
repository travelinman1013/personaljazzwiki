## Biography
Janel Leppin (born 1981), a classically trained American jazz cellist, composer, and multi-instrumentalist, and guitarist Anthony Pirog, born in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania and raised in the Washington D.C. area including Vienna, Virginia, formed the instrumental duo Janel & Anthony in 2005 after meeting around that time. As musical and life partners (married, with over twenty years together), they are central figures in D.C.'s music scene, blending ambient-tinged music that melds classical, world, jazz, psych-rock, experimental, and art-punk elements. Leppin, a third-generation artist with deep Virginia roots, began as a sideperson for fourteen years (bass, keyboards, cello, vocals) across diverse genres, while Pirog pursued various ensembles from trios to septets. Their debut album Where Is Home was released in 2012 on Cuneiform Records, followed by a long hiatus due to individual projects, touring, studio costs, and Leppin's physical injuries that sidelined her cello playing during college, leading her to explore electronics introduced by Pirog.[1][2][4][5][7][9]

The duo's highly anticipated second album, New Moon in the Evil Age (Cuneiform, 2024), features Leppin on cello, modified cello, vocals, synthesizers, piano, koto, hammered dulcimer, and bass, alongside Pirog's electric/acoustic guitars, guitar synth, synthesizers, bass, and percussion, with guests Devin Hoff on bass and Dr. Ali Analouei on daf and tombak. Leppin's career also includes leading Ensemble Volcanic Ash (formed 2007, debut To March Is to Love in 2024), inspired by Julius Hemphill and featuring Pirog, Brian Settles, Sarah Hughes, Luke Stewart, and Larry Ferguson; she curated Giuseppa Cartella's music for Issue Project Room with Pirog and others like Eyvind Kang. Post-injury, electronics expanded her sound, allowing return to cello via therapy, while influences like Abdul Wadud and David Baker shaped her jazz cello approach.[1][3][4]

Their legacy endures through extensive collaborations and independent work, with Leppin on over a dozen albums (e.g., with Eyvind Kang, Marissa Nadler, Priests, The Messthetics) and Pirog's leadership projects. Active over two decades in D.C., they continue evolving, chipping away at Janel & Anthony material amid busy schedules, cementing their role in experimental and chamber jazz.[1][2][3][4][6]

## Fun Facts
- Leppin wrecked her upper body in college, quitting cello for a year and playing multiple instruments to stay in music until Pirog introduced electronics, allowing her to expand her sound around the pain.[1]
