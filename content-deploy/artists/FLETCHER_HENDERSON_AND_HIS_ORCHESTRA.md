## Biography
Fletcher Henderson and His Orchestra, formed in the early 1920s, was a pioneering force in American jazz and swing music. Led by Fletcher Henderson, a classically trained pianist and arranger from Cuthbert, Georgia, the group became a central figure in the Harlem Renaissance, blending intricate harmonies and rhythmic innovation to create the foundation of the big band sound[1][2][3]. Henderson's early life was shaped by his family's emphasis on education and music—his mother was a piano teacher, and he graduated from Atlanta College with a degree in chemistry before racial barriers led him to pursue a career in music[2][3].

Henderson's orchestra quickly rose to prominence in New York City, attracting exceptional talent such as Louis Armstrong, Coleman Hawkins, and Benny Carter. With the help of arranger Don Redman, Henderson developed the formula for swing jazz, introducing sectional arrangements and call-and-response techniques that defined the genre[2][4][5]. The orchestra's decade-long residency at the Roseland Ballroom solidified its reputation, and Henderson's arrangements were later adopted by Benny Goodman, further spreading the influence of swing[3][4].

Despite periods of financial instability and changing musical tastes, Henderson's legacy endures as the "uncrowned king of swing." His innovative approach to band organization, arrangements, and improvisation not only shaped the sound of big band jazz but also inspired generations of musicians. A museum in his honor stands in Cuthbert, Georgia, commemorating his lasting impact on American music[4].

## Fun Facts
- Fletcher Henderson originally studied chemistry and mathematics, intending to become a scientist before racial discrimination led him to music[2][3].
- His orchestra was known as the 'Birthplace of Swing,' and Henderson is credited with establishing many of the rules for big band jazz[1][7].
- Henderson was the first Black musician hired by Benny Goodman to play in a white band, breaking racial barriers in the music industry[2].
- A museum dedicated to Henderson’s legacy exists in his hometown of Cuthbert, Georgia[4].
