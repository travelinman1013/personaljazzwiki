## Biography
Thomas James Hunt, known professionally as Tommy Hunt, was born on June 18, 1933, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and became one of the most significant figures in northern soul music. After a tumultuous early life that included time in reform school and the U.S. Air Force, Hunt went AWOL to be with his dying mother and subsequently served prison time for desertion. Following his release, he relocated to Chicago where he joined the Five Echoes before being recruited by the legendary doo-wop group the Flamingos in 1959, replacing drafted member Zeke Carey. With the Flamingos, Hunt achieved international success with the classic recording "I Only Have Eyes for You," performing alongside musical giants including Jackie Wilson, Marvin Gaye, Ray Charles, and Diana Ross, and becoming a regular performer at the Apollo Theater in New York.

In 1970, seeking new opportunities, Hunt made the pivotal decision to relocate to England, where he would reinvent himself as a northern soul icon. He became a fixture on the northern soul circuit, performing at legendary venues like the Wigan Casino and recording several hits on Spark Records, including a cover of "Crackin' Up." His passionate vocal delivery and authentic soul style resonated deeply with the northern soul audience, earning him a devoted following of over one million fans and establishing him as one of the greatest vocalists of the movement. Hunt's career spanned decades, taking him from the cabaret circuit to Amsterdam in 1986 and eventually back to the UK in 1997, where he continued performing with backing groups including the New Flamingos, the Black Beltones, and the Twisted Wheels. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001 as a member of the Flamingos and received the Rhythm and Blues Foundation Lifetime Achievement Award in 1996. Hunt passed away on February 12, 2025, at the age of 91, leaving behind a legacy that spanned from the golden age of doo-wop through the northern soul renaissance.
