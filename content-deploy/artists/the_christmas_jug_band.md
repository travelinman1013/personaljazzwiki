- **Origin**: Mill Valley

## Biography
The Christmas Jug Band emerged from a spontaneous gathering of musicians in Mill Valley, California during the mid-1970s. A small group of friends with a shared appreciation for Kentucky bourbon and acoustic folk music—including Gregory Leroy "Duke Dagreeze" Dewey (formerly of Mad River and Country Joe & the Fish), his brother Nicholas Q. Dewey, Tim Eschliman (who had worked with Commander Cody and Etta James), and Paul Wenninger (road manager for Van Morrison)—began hosting weekly Appalachian-style jug jam sessions known as "The Monday Night Wild Turkey Jug Band." These early sessions, which lasted only 10 weeks around 1976, were characterized by a commitment to spontaneity and acoustic authenticity, deliberately avoiding cover songs and "too-good-sounding" instruments in favor of homemade and traditional instruments like washtub bass, washboard, jaw harp, and even coat hangers struck against wooden tables. The band's official origin as The Christmas Jug Band traces to December 19, 1977, when they performed at the Old Mill Tavern as "The Three Wise Men +4 -1 Jug Band" to cover for Dan Hicks, who was away on a recording session. Following the tavern owner's suggestion, they performed a Christmas Eve show that same year, establishing an annual holiday tradition that has now spanned over 47 years. In 1987, Globe Records released their debut album "Mistletoe Jam" on green vinyl, officially cementing the group's identity as The Christmas Jug Band.

## Fun Facts
- The band's name "The Three Wise Men +4 -1 Jug Band" from their first official performance on December 19, 1977, was a playful mathematical reference reflecting their rotating lineup of musicians.
- Carbon-dating of leftover Kentucky bourbon decanters from the original Monday Night Wild Turkey Jug Band sessions pinpointed the year 1976 as the band's true genesis, predating their official formation by one year.
- The Christmas Jug Band's song "Santa Claus Is Coming To Town" from their "Mistletoe Jam" album was licensed by Japanese retailer Francfranc in December 2012 for their "Jukebox Christmas" release, demonstrating international recognition of their work.
- Their track "Twas the Night Before Christmas" from "Mistletoe Jam" was featured on NBC's "My Name Is Earl" (Season 1, Episode 10, "White Lie Christmas"), bringing their irreverent holiday sound to mainstream television audiences.
