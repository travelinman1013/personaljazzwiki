## Biography
Nigel Hall is an accomplished American vocalist, keyboardist, and songwriter born September 15, 1981, in Washington, D.C.[1] He grew up in a highly musical family, beginning piano lessons before kindergarten age, and was deeply influenced by his father's extensive record collection, which exposed him to jazz fusion artists like Chick Corea's Return to Forever alongside contemporary pop.[1][3] Hall was discovered around 2007 by Lettuce co-founder Ryan Zoidis, who invited him to Brooklyn to collaborate with the jazz band Soulive and meet Eric Krasno, a pivotal moment that launched his professional career.[1] This connection led to appearances with multiple influential acts and eventually his Grammy nomination for work on Ledisi's 2009 album Turn Me Loose.[1]

In 2011, Hall relocated to New Orleans to immerse himself in the city's rich musical heritage, a decision he has described as "the best decision I ever made for myself in my life and musically."[2] During this period, he was drafted by pianist Jon Cleary for his Grammy-winning album Go-Go Juice, toured with Robert Randolph and the Family Band and John Scofield, and joined the Warren Haynes Band.[1] In 2012, he co-founded The Nth Power with former Beyoncé drummer Nikki Glaspie, establishing himself as a bandleader in the funk-soul-R&B sphere.[1] Hall joined Lettuce as a full-time keyboardist and vocalist in 2015 and released his solo debut album Ladies & Gentlemen... Nigel Hall that same year, which became a commercial and critical success.[1]

Hall's musical style synthesizes classic soul, funk, hip-hop, and R&B with jazz-inflected sensibilities, drawing inspiration from the golden ages of these genres.[2] His work has been compared to Southern funk godfather Art Neville by the Times-Picayune.[3] As both a solo artist and member of the Grammy-nominated band Lettuce, Hall has performed at major festivals including New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival (five consecutive years as a featured solo artist), Bonnaroo, and the Essence Music Festival, establishing himself as a vital figure in contemporary funk and soul music.[1]

## Fun Facts
- Hall began playing piano before he was five years old and was listening to Chick Corea's Return to Forever fusion project on his Walkman in third grade while his peers listened to mainstream pop like Ace of Base.[3]
- At a 2013 Bonnaroo performance, Hall shared the stage with an eclectic lineup including Chaka Khan, Derek Trucks, Solange, members of the Wu-Tang Clan, Chance the Rapper, and Thundercat.[1]
- The title of his album 'Spiritual' came from a literal sign he saw during recording sessions at Jellowstone Studios in Richmond, VA—he walked past a sign that simply said 'Spiritual' and interpreted it as a sign from God.[2]
- The Times-Picayune compared Hall to Southern funk godfather Art Neville upon his solo debut at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival in 2014, just months after relocating to New Orleans.[3]
