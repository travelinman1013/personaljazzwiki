## Biography
Meschiya Lake, born in southern Oregon and raised in South Dakota, began her musical journey at age nine when she won an adults-only singing contest in a South Dakota steakhouse, earning $500 and a regular gig[1][7]. Her early years were marked by unconventional experiences, including performing as a glass eater in a traveling sideshow before arriving in New Orleans in 2000, where she was immediately captivated by the city's vibrant culture and musical heritage[1]. Lake's immersion into the New Orleans jazz scene began in earnest in 2007 when she joined the street-performing jazz collective The Loose Marbles, which she describes as her 'jazz boot camp,' helping her develop an extensive repertoire and deep understanding of traditional jazz[1][3][6].

Unsatisfied with being a sideman, Lake formed her own group, Meschiya Lake & The Little Big Horns, in 2009, quickly establishing herself as a leading figure in the city's revivalist jazz movement[3][5][6]. The band’s debut album, 'Lucky Devil,' was self-produced and garnered international acclaim, with NPR’s David Kunian naming it one of the top New Orleans releases of 2010[1][2]. Lake’s powerful vocals and songwriting blend early jazz sensibilities with contemporary flair, earning her multiple accolades, including three consecutive Big Easy Awards for Best Female Performer and recognition as Best Female Singer by Offbeat Magazine in 2013 and 2014[2][3]. The Little Big Horns have performed globally, representing New Orleans at festivals and venues such as Lincoln Center and the I Love Jazz Festival in Brazil[1][2].

Lake’s musical style is rooted in swing, ragtime, and traditional jazz, but she also draws connections to country music and cabaret, reflecting the diverse influences of her upbringing and career[5][6]. Her legacy is defined by her role in revitalizing New Orleans jazz, mentoring younger musicians, and bridging the gap between historic and modern interpretations of the genre. Lake continues to perform, record, and lecture on jazz and blues history, solidifying her status as a modern-day chanteuse and ambassador of New Orleans music[4][6].
