## Biography
Tito Puente, born Ernest Anthony Puente Jr. on April 20, 1923, in Spanish Harlem, New York City, was the son of Puerto Rican immigrants. From an early age, Puente showed a remarkable affinity for rhythm, famously banging on pots and pans before his mother redirected his energy into piano lessons. By age 10, he had switched to percussion, inspired by jazz drummer Gene Krupa, and was already performing professionally in his teens. After serving in the U.S. Navy during World War II, Puente used the G.I. Bill to study at the Juilliard School, where he refined his musical skills and deepened his understanding of composition and orchestration.[1][3][5]

Puente's career took off in the late 1940s when he formed his own orchestra, quickly becoming a central figure in New York's vibrant Latin music scene. He was a pioneering bandleader, composer, and percussionist, renowned for blending Afro-Cuban rhythms with jazz, mambo, cha-cha-cha, and salsa. His innovative arrangements and virtuosic timbales playing helped popularize Latin dance music worldwide. Puente released over 100 albums, composed more than 400 works, and received five Grammy Awards, including a posthumous Latin Grammy. His signature songs, such as "Oye Como Va" and "Ran Kan Kan," became standards, and his energetic performances at venues like the Palladium Ballroom made him a cultural icon known as "El Rey de los Timbales" (The King of the Timbales).[1][3][4][5][6][8]

Puente's influence extended far beyond his own recordings. He collaborated with jazz and Latin music legends, mentored younger musicians, and inspired generations of artists. His legacy endures through his recordings, his impact on Latin jazz and salsa, and his role in bringing Latin music to mainstream audiences around the world.[2][4][5]
