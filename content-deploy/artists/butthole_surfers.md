## Biography
Butthole Surfers is an American rock band formed in 1981 in San Antonio, Texas, by vocalist Gibson “Gibby” Haynes and guitarist Paul Leary, classmates at Trinity University who initially seemed headed for straight careers in accounting and business before veering into underground art and music.[3][4][6][7] Drawn together by an interest in non‑mainstream culture, they briefly decamped to Southern California, self‑published the grotesque and satirical zine *Strange V.D.*, and then returned to Texas to launch the band that would become Butthole Surfers, playing early shows in art galleries and small punk venues.[3] Through the early 1980s they cycled through rhythm sections before settling into a core lineup with dual drummers King Coffey and Teresa Taylor (Teresa Nervosa) and, later, bassist Jeff Pinkus, while aligning themselves with the U.S. hardcore and post‑punk underground via labels like Alternative Tentacles and Touch and Go.[1][3][6]

Throughout the 1980s the band became notorious for chaotic, confrontational live shows that mixed strobe lights, film projections, nudity, tape collages, and heavy use of drugs and alcohol, earning them a reputation as one of the most extreme acts on the touring circuit.[2][4][5] Musically they fused hardcore punk, psychedelic rock, noise, metal, and surreal tape manipulation into albums such as *Psychic… Powerless… Another Man’s Sac* (1984), *Rembrandt Pussyhorse* (1986), and the highly influential *Locust Abortion Technician* (1987), recorded largely in self‑built home studios around Austin and Driftwood, Texas.[3][5] In the 1990s they surprised many by signing to Capitol Records, working with producer John Paul Jones, and eventually achieving mainstream success with the 1996 album *Electriclarryland* and its hit single “Pepper,” all while retaining an absurdist, nihilistic sensibility rooted in Dada, performance art, and a distrust of conventional rock messaging.[3][4]

The band’s legacy lies in its role as a bridge between early‑1980s American hardcore and the later alternative and noise‑rock movements, as well as in its impact on live performance aesthetics in underground rock.[4][5][6] Their willingness to embrace ugliness, black humor, and sensory overload made them a touchstone for later experimental and alternative bands who sought to subvert rock norms rather than simply refine them, and *Locust Abortion Technician* in particular is frequently cited as a landmark of noisy, psychedelic underground rock that influenced generations of artists in grunge, alt‑rock, and noise scenes.[3][5][8]

## Fun Facts
- Before forming Butthole Surfers, Gibby Haynes and Paul Leary published a homemade magazine called “Strange V.D.” that paired real medical photos of bizarre ailments with fictitious, darkly comic explanations; Haynes left his accounting job after being caught with the zine at work.[3]
- The band’s name reportedly stuck after a club MC introduced them as “Butthole Surfers” for a show when they were still changing names frequently; that was the first night they received a decent payout, so they took it as an omen and kept the name.[2]
- During the mid‑1980s the band often toured with a dual‑drummer setup and a nude or semi‑nude dancer (Kathleen Lynch), while projecting disturbing medical and experimental films behind them, making their shows infamous even by underground punk standards.[3][5]
- Despite their reputation for chaos, from roughly 1985 to 1990 they were one of the rare independent, resolutely uncommercial bands that could actually make a living solely from constant touring across the U.S. and Europe.[2]
