## Biography
Phyllis Hyman was born on July 6, 1949, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and raised in Pittsburgh. She began her professional music career in New York City in the early 1970s, where her powerful, jazz-influenced voice quickly drew attention. Hyman's breakthrough came when she was invited by Norman Connors to sing on his album, leading to the hit "You Are My Starship." This success propelled her into the spotlight and established her as a sought-after vocalist in the jazz and R&B scenes.

Throughout the late 1970s and 1980s, Hyman developed a reputation for her emotive delivery and sophisticated blend of philly soul, quiet storm, and classic soul. Her notable solo hits include "You Know How to Love Me," "Living All Alone," and "Don't Wanna Change the World." She also achieved acclaim on Broadway, starring in the Duke Ellington tribute "Sophisticated Ladies," for which she earned a Tony Award nomination and a Theatre World Award. Despite struggles with record label disputes and personal challenges, Hyman's artistry remained consistent, culminating in her most successful album, "Prime of My Life," in 1991, which featured her first number-one R&B hit.

Hyman's legacy is marked by her rich, expressive voice and her ability to convey deep emotion through her music. She was celebrated for her contributions to R&B, soul, and jazz, influencing a generation of vocalists. Her untimely death in 1995 left a lasting impact on fans and fellow musicians, and her work continues to be celebrated for its depth and artistry.
