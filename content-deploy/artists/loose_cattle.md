## Biography
Loose Cattle is a New Orleans-based Americana roots rock quintet, celebrated for their blood harmonies and genre-melding musical dexterity[5]. The band was co-founded and is fronted by Michael Cerveris, a West Virginia native and two-time Tony and Grammy Award-winning performer, and Kimberly Kaye, a New Jersey-born arts journalist, functional medicine practitioner, and LGBTQ activist[1][4]. Cerveris began his musical journey in junior high with a rock band and later played with influential artists such as Bob Mould, Pete Townshend, Frank Black, and Teenage Fanclub, performing at venues ranging from CBGBs to Carnegie Hall[4]. Kaye, meanwhile, first cut her musical teeth touring with a ska band on the Warped Tour circuit before shifting her focus to roots music and theater, becoming a notable figure in New Orleans' creative community[1][2].

Loose Cattle's sound is rooted in Southern rock and folk traditions, blending wry observations of human frailty with pointed social commentary. Their music is described as tight, atmospheric country rock, drawing comparisons to late 20th-century alt-country acts like R.E.M., Lucinda Williams, and Drive-By Truckers[3]. The band's lineup includes René Coman (bass), Doug Garrison (drums), and Rurik Nunan (fiddle/vocals), all of whom bring diverse musical backgrounds from groups such as The Iguanas, Alex Chilton's band, and The Whisky Gentry[1]. Loose Cattle's albums have featured collaborations with notable artists, including Lucinda Williams and Patterson Hood, and their latest release, 'Someone’s Monster,' marks a shift toward more original songwriting and eclectic influences[2][3].

Loose Cattle has established a legacy as 'favorite Americana cowpunks in New Orleans,' advocating for inclusion and supporting marginalized communities through both their music and activism[1]. Their commitment to the New Orleans music scene is reflected in their collaborative spirit and mutual support, with the local community playing a vital role in their development and resilience, especially during times of personal hardship[2].
