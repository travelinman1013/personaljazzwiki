## Biography
Tin Hat Trio, now known simply as Tin Hat, is an innovative acoustic chamber ensemble founded in San Francisco in 1997 by Rob Burger (accordion, piano), Carla Kihlstedt (violin, viola, vocals), and Mark Orton (guitar, dobro, banjo). The group’s origins trace back to the early friendship of Orton and Burger, who attended elementary school together in Stonybrook, New York, while Kihlstedt grew up in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Each member brought a strong classical background, with studies at prestigious institutions such as Peabody Conservatory, Hartt School of Music, Juilliard, University of Massachusetts, and Oberlin Conservatory. The trio first played together in the mid-1990s, experimenting with acoustic improvisation and blending diverse genres while traveling across the United States.[1][2]

From their debut, Tin Hat Trio distinguished themselves by fusing classical composition with jazz, free improvisation, Eastern European melodies, bluegrass, tango, and avant-garde influences. Their albums, including 'Memory Is an Elephant' and 'The Rodeo Eroded,' often featured prominent guest artists such as Tom Waits, Mike Patton, and Willie Nelson. The group’s sound evolved over time, especially after Rob Burger’s departure in 2004, when the ensemble expanded to include musicians like Ben Goldberg and Zeena Parkins, and briefly performed as the Tin Hat Quartet. In 2013, the original trio reunited to contribute to the soundtrack for Alexander Payne’s film 'Nebraska,' composed by Mark Orton.[2][3][4]

Tin Hat Trio’s legacy lies in their genre-defying approach, seamlessly blending chamber music with folk, jazz, and world traditions. Their innovative instrumentation, improvisational spirit, and collaborations have influenced a generation of musicians interested in crossing stylistic boundaries. Their music is noted for its cinematic quality, emotional depth, and technical virtuosity, earning them a unique place in contemporary chamber and indie jazz scenes.[2][4]
