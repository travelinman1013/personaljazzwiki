## Biography
William Bell, born in Memphis in 1939, began his musical journey singing in church and performing live gigs as a teenager. He started his career with the group the Del Rios before making his solo debut in 1961 with the single 'You Don’t Miss Your Water,' which became a significant hit and an early example of soul music. Bell's career was interrupted by military service, but upon his return, he released his debut album 'The Soul of a Bell' in 1969, featuring hits like 'Everybody Loves a Winner.' He continued to thrive at Stax Records, collaborating with Judy Clay on 'Private Number' and writing 'A Tribute To A King' after Otis Redding's death. In 1977, Bell achieved a major success with 'Tryin’ to Love Two,' which topped the R&B charts. His musical style is deeply rooted in classic soul, and he has been influential in shaping the Southern soul genre. Bell's legacy extends beyond his own music, as his songs have been covered by numerous artists, including Billy Idol and Ludacris. In 2016, he released 'This Is Where I Live,' which marked a resurgence in his career and was praised for its vintage soul sound.
