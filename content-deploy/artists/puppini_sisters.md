## Biography
The Puppini Sisters are a vocal trio based in England, specializing in 1940s-style close harmony singing with a modern 'swing-punk' twist, founded in 2004 by Marcella Puppini. Inspired by the 2003 animated film *Les Triplettes de Belleville*, Puppini—originally trained in fashion design at St. Martins School of Art—pursued music studies at Trinity College of Music, where she met Kate Mullins and initial member Rosanna Schura, later replaced by Stephanie O'Brien. Despite not being related, the group named themselves in tribute to The Andrews Sisters, debuting with a cover of their 'Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy'.[1][2][4][5]

Their career gained momentum with the 2006 album *Betcha Bottom Dollar*, which earned a Gold Disc for international sales in 2007, peaking at #2 on the US Jazz Charts and #9 on the US New Artist Chart. The follow-up *The Rise & Fall of Ruby Woo* (2007) reached #5 on the US Jazz Charts in 2008, blending classic covers, 1940s reworkings of contemporary songs, and originals. Active since 2004, the current lineup features Marcella Puppini, Kate Mullins, and Emma Smith (since 2012, replacing O'Brien), supported by a band including Blake Wilner (guitar), Peter Ibbetson (drums/percussion), and Henrik Jensen (upright bass).[1][4]

Known for tight harmonies described as 'so tight you could bounce a baby off them,' their style mixes swing with punk energy, louder and more dynamic than traditional swing. Puppini serves as founder, musical director, composer, and arranger, drawing on her classical training and jazz vocal background to sustain a legacy of retro revival.[1][4][6]
