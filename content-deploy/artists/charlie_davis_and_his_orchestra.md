## Biography
Charlie Davis, born in Indianapolis and the son of trombonist Abijah Davis, emerged as a significant figure in American jazz during the 1920s and 1930s. After receiving classical piano training and learning trumpet, Davis was inspired by the vibrant dance band scene he encountered while attending Notre Dame in 1917. In 1923, he formed the Charlie Davis Band—sometimes called The Joy Gang—in Indianapolis. The group quickly evolved from a small combo into a prominent big band, known for their 'sweet style' and regular performances at Casino Gardens, a leading dance venue in Indianapolis. Their popularity led to a recording contract with Gennett Records, where Davis's compositions, such as 'Copenhagen' and 'Jimtown Blues' (the latter co-written with Fred Rose), became jazz standards.

The Charlie Davis Band's influence extended beyond Indiana, intersecting with notable contemporaries like Hoagy Carmichael and Bix Beiderbecke’s Wolverines, with whom they shared stages at Butler College and Luna Lite Theater in 1924. The Wolverines' recording of Davis's 'Copenhagen' further cemented his legacy in jazz history. By the late 1920s, Davis's orchestra was performing in New York alongside major acts such as Rudy Vallee, Duke Ellington, Cab Calloway, Bojangles Robinson, and Ethel Merman, even sharing a Paramount Theatre marquee with Ellington. The band also toured internationally, performing in Russia, Mexico, Spain, France, Holland, and South Africa. After the band dissolved in the 1930s, Davis transitioned to a business career in Oswego, New York, while several of his band members went on to notable achievements in music and entertainment.
