## Biography
Gilbert John Landry, born December 10, 1975, in Lake Charles, Louisiana, received his first guitar at age 5 and began his musical journey as a street busker in New Orleans, the Pacific Northwest, and Europe, often living out of Volkswagens. In 1998, he co-founded the Kitchen Syncopators with Woody Pines, emerging from a vaudeville-inspired show featuring early American music influenced by figures like Baby Gramps. His immersion in American folk traditions led him to join Old Crow Medicine Show in 2004, initially filling in for Critter Fuqua; he contributed guitar, banjo, pedal steel, vocals, and songwriting through their van tours, Grand Ole Opry induction, and Grammy win for *Remedy* (2014), departing in 2015 to focus on solo work.[1][2][4]

Landry's solo career began with *The Ballad of Lawless Soirez* (2007, Nettwerk), followed by *Piety & Desire* (2011, self-released, featuring Felice Brothers, Brandi Carlile, Jolie Holland, Ketch Secor, and Samantha Parton), his self-titled third album (2015, ATO Records, with Ross Holmes, Skylar Wilson, Logan Matheny), *Love Rides a Dark Horse* (2017), and further releases across six albums total. A multi-instrumentalist, visual artist, photographer, and self-taught painter, his style blends americana, southern gothic, alt-country, Dylan-inspired folk-rock, delta blues, atmospheric Americana, and cinematic introspection, marked by poetic lyrics, baritone vocals evoking Leonard Cohen, Kris Kristofferson, and Dave Alvin.[1][2][4][5]

Landry's legacy includes two Grammy Awards via Old Crow Medicine Show, extensive touring (e.g., Americana Music Festival with Loretta Lynn and Steve Earle, support for Warren Haynes, festivals in Europe), and performances with Dianna Agron at Café Carlyle (2017, 2019). His versatile, genre-defying work resonates with timeless folk innovation while drawing from busker roots and nomadic life experiences.[1][2][3]
