## Biography
Huey "Piano" Smith (January 26, 1934 – February 13, 2023) was a pioneering American R&B pianist and songwriter, born in the Central City neighborhood of New Orleans, Louisiana. Growing up amid the city’s vibrant musical culture, Smith was drawn early to the piano, composing his first song at age eight and performing locally as a teenager. Deeply influenced by boogie-woogie and jazz greats such as Pete Johnson, Meade Lux Lewis, Albert Ammons, and especially New Orleans legend Professor Longhair, Smith developed a rollicking, shuffling piano style that became his signature[1][2].

Smith’s professional career began in earnest in his teens, working in clubs and recording with blues guitarist Guitar Slim. By the mid-1950s, he was an in-demand session pianist, contributing to recordings by Earl King, Lloyd Price, Smiley Lewis, and even Little Richard’s first band. In 1957, Smith formed Huey "Piano" Smith and His Clowns, a group that would define his legacy with hits like "Rockin' Pneumonia and the Boogie Woogie Flu" and "Don't You Just Know It." His infectious, good-humored approach epitomized New Orleans R&B and helped shape the sound of early rock and roll[1][2][4].

Despite later struggles with changing musical tastes and industry challenges, Smith remained an influential figure, performing and recording into the 1970s. His work has been widely recognized for its impact on both R&B and rock, and his playful, rhythmic piano style continues to inspire musicians across genres. Smith passed away in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in 2023, leaving behind a legacy as one of New Orleans' most distinctive and influential musical voices[1][2].
