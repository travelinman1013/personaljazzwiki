## Biography
Brass Bed is an American indie rock band originating from Lafayette, Louisiana, known for blending elements of power pop, psychedelic rock, and the regional influences of Cajun and zydeco music. Formed in the mid-2000s, the group emerged from the vibrant music scene of southern Louisiana, an area steeped in French Creole traditions and the rhythmic pulse of zydeco and Cajun genres. The band’s core members—Christiaan Mader, Peter DeHart, and Jonny Campos—began collaborating while attending college, drawing inspiration from both the local musical heritage and contemporary indie rock sounds.

Over the course of their career, Brass Bed has released several critically acclaimed albums, including 'Melt White' (2010), 'The Secret Will Keep You' (2013), and 'In the Yellow Leaf' (2016). Their music is characterized by intricate harmonies, inventive guitar work, and a willingness to experiment with song structures, all while maintaining a melodic sensibility. Brass Bed’s sound reflects the unique cultural crossroads of Louisiana, incorporating the syncopated rhythms and melodic motifs of Cajun and zydeco music into a modern indie framework. While not a zydeco or Cajun band in the traditional sense, their work pays homage to these genres through subtle stylistic nods and collaborations with local musicians.

Brass Bed has played a significant role in bridging the gap between Louisiana’s traditional music and the broader indie rock scene, earning a devoted following both regionally and nationally. Their innovative approach and commitment to their roots have made them a respected fixture in the Louisiana music community, influencing a new generation of musicians interested in exploring the intersections of tradition and modernity.
