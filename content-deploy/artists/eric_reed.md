## Biography
Eric Scott Reed is an American jazz pianist, composer, bandleader, and educator, widely recognized as one of the leading straight‑ahead jazz pianists of his generation. Born on June 21, 1970, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, he was raised in a deeply musical, church-centered environment, playing piano in his father’s storefront Baptist church from early childhood.[2][4] A noted child prodigy, he began picking out hymns on the piano at around age two and started formal lessons at seven at Philadelphia’s Settlement Music School, though he often learned pieces by ear rather than from the page.[2][4] After his family moved to Los Angeles when he was eleven, Reed continued his studies at the Richard D. Colburn School of Performing Arts and was mentored by composer and educator Harold Battiste, immersing himself in jazz recordings by Ahmad Jamal, Horace Silver, Erroll Garner, Oscar Peterson, McCoy Tyner, and others.[2]

By his mid‑teens, Reed was already working professionally around Los Angeles, leading his own groups and performing with veterans such as Teddy Edwards, Gerald Wilson, Clora Bryant, and John Clayton.[2] At 18, he began touring with trumpeter Wynton Marsalis, and soon became the pianist in Marsalis’s acclaimed Septet (1990–91, 1992–95) and a member of the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra (1996–98), appearing on major albums including *Citi Movement*, *In This House, On This Morning*, *Jump Start and Jazz*, *Blood on the Fields*, and *Standard Time, Vol. 5: The Midnight Blues*.[1][2] During this period he also worked with Freddie Hubbard and Joe Henderson and began releasing his own records as a leader, eventually building a discography of 30‑plus albums that showcase his command of swing, bebop, gospel harmony, and the blues.[1][6] Reed’s style blends the rhythmic drive and hard‑swinging language of pianists like Horace Silver and Ahmad Jamal with the harmonic richness and sanctified feeling drawn from Black gospel, a synthesis that has earned him praise from elders such as Ahmad Jamal, who called him "one of my very favorite pianists."[2]

From the mid‑1990s onward, Reed has toured internationally with his own trios and larger ensembles, topped jazz radio charts with albums like *Pure Imagination* and *Manhattan Melodies*, and branched into film scoring, including music for the Eddie Murphy–Martin Lawrence film *Life*.[2] He has collaborated with a wide spectrum of jazz and popular artists—among them Elvin Jones, Benny Carter, Wayne Shorter, Ron Carter, Cassandra Wilson, Jimmy Heath, Clark Terry, Dianne Reeves, Quincy Jones, Natalie Cole, and Edwin Hawkins—and has become increasingly active as an educator and artistic director.[2][6] In the 2010s and 2020s, Reed continued to record prolifically, including the deeply personal album *Black, Brown & Blue*, which he has described as his most autobiographical work and his first project made while living openly as a bisexual man.[1][3] Alongside his performance and recording career, he has held university teaching positions, including succeeding pianist Donald Brown at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, further cementing his role as a bridge between jazz’s storied past and its emerging generations.[3][6]

## Fun Facts
- Eric Reed was such a prodigy that he began playing piano at around age two and could play gospel music in his father’s church by the time he was five, yet he often preferred to learn pieces entirely by ear instead of reading the written music, confounding his early teachers.[2][4]
- As a teenager in Los Angeles, Reed effectively "self‑taught" himself jazz by systematically checking out classic albums from his neighborhood library, devouring recordings by Ahmad Jamal, Erroll Garner, Oscar Peterson, McCoy Tyner, and others until, by age thirteen, he had absorbed much of the core jazz canon players were expected to know.[2]
- Reed’s album *Pure Imagination* became a breakout success on jazz radio, reaching #1 on the Gavin chart and remaining there for seven weeks, which led to him being named Gavin’s Artist of the Year in 1999.[2]
- In addition to his work as a jazz pianist, Reed has composed for film, including contributing music to the 1999 Hollywood comedy *Life* starring Eddie Murphy and Martin Lawrence, demonstrating his range beyond the jazz club and concert hall.[2]
