## Biography
Nick Lucas (born Dominic Nicholas Anthony Lucanese on August 22, 1897, in Newark, New Jersey) was an American singer and pioneering jazz and popular-music guitarist often billed as “the Crooning Troubadour.”[1][4][7] Raised in an Italian-American family, he learned guitar, mandolin, and banjo at an early age and played with his brother Frank at local Italian weddings, christenings, on street corners, and in saloons.[1][2][4] As a teenager he made experimental recordings for Thomas Edison and soon entered vaudeville and dance-band work, performing with groups like the Kentucky Five and working in New York with bandleaders Vincent Lopez and the Vernon Country Club Orchestra, where he began his professional recording career in 1921.[2][3] In 1922 he cut what is widely regarded as the first solo jazz guitar record, his own compositions “Picking the Guitar” and “Teasin’ the Frets” for Pathé, and at the same time became one of the earliest guitarists featured in a dance-band rhythm section.[2][4][5]

Through the mid‑1920s Lucas evolved from instrumental specialist to one of the first popular radio crooners, developing an intimate vocal style while accompanying himself on guitar that made him a major recording star.[2][4] His 1924 recording “My Best Girl” showcased this new approach just as electrical recording was arriving, allowing his soft, melodious singing to be fully appreciated.[4] In 1926, Gibson introduced the Nick Lucas Special, one of the first artist‑signature guitars, reflecting his status as perhaps the first 20th‑century American “guitar star.”[2][3][4] He toured Europe in 1926, setting attendance records at the London Palladium and Café de Paris, and in 1929 appeared in Warner Bros.’ all‑talking musical *Gold Diggers of Broadway*, introducing “Painting the Clouds with Sunshine” and, especially, “Tip-Toe Thru’ the Tulips,” which became a number‑one hit and sold over two million copies.[1][2][4] He remained active on radio, in shorts for Universal and Warner Bros., and in nightclubs across the United States and abroad through the 1930s and 1940s, and later worked the burgeoning casino circuits in Las Vegas, Reno, and Lake Tahoe while making frequent television appearances.[1][2] In 1974 he had a cameo in the film *The Great Gatsby*, performing period songs that recalled his 1920s heyday.[1]

Lucas’s musical style fused early jazz and ragtime syncopation with a lyrical, crooning vocal delivery and a technically advanced plectrum guitar technique that emphasized clear melody and inventive chordal work.[1][2][3][4] Often called “the grandfather of the jazz guitar,” he paved the way for generations of guitar‑centered popular music by bringing the instrument from the rhythm section to the front of the stage, helping establish the guitar as a lead voice in American popular and jazz contexts.[2][3][4][7] His recording career stretched from 1912 test cylinders through the stereophonic age around 1980—one of the longest in popular music history—with total disc sales reported in excess of 80 million (some sources say 84 million), most from the 1920s.[1][2] Though his mainstream fame waned with the rise of swing, he enjoyed a resurgence in the late 1960s when Tiny Tim revived “Tip-Toe Thru’ the Tulips” and invited Lucas to perform it at his widely watched 1969 wedding on *The Tonight Show*.[5] Lucas died in Newark, New Jersey, on July 28, 1982, leaving a legacy as an important bridge between ragtime, early jazz, and the modern singer‑guitarist tradition.[1][4][5][7]

## Fun Facts
- Nick Lucas is widely credited with making what is considered the first solo jazz guitar record, pairing his own compositions “Picking the Guitar” and “Teasin’ the Frets” for Pathé in 1922.[2][4][5]
- He was among the very first entertainers to feature the guitar as a solo star instrument in popular music, leading Gibson to produce the Nick Lucas Special in 1926—one of the earliest artist‑signature guitars, predating models for admirers like Gene Autry.[2][4]
- Lucas introduced the song “Yes, We Have No Bananas” while playing with the Russo–Fiorito Orchestra at Chicago’s Edgewater Beach Hotel, where broadcasts from WEBH radio carried his performance nationwide.[1]
- Although offered a seven‑year contract by Warner Bros. after the success of *Gold Diggers of Broadway*, Lucas turned it down; the contract instead went to Dick Powell, who went on to become one of the studio’s major musical stars.[1]
