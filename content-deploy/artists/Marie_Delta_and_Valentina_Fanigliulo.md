## Biography
Marie Delta is the solo project of Mariette Auvray, a Paris-based musician known for her innovative blend of electronic pop, analog synthesizers, guitars, and drum machines. Before embarking on her solo career, she was an active member of several post-punk and psychedelic bands, including Pussy Patrol, Eyes Behind, and BCBG. Her music is characterized by a dreamy, synth-driven soundscape, often featuring both French and English lyrics, and explores themes of nocturnal journeys and emotional introspection, as heard on her album 'Route de nuit.'

Valentina Fanigliulo does not appear in any credible music databases, press coverage, or artist platforms in connection with Marie Delta or as an independent artist. It is possible that the name is either a misattribution or refers to a non-musical professional, as the only references found for 'Fanigliulo' relate to academic or scientific publications, not music. Therefore, this biography focuses solely on Marie Delta (Mariette Auvray), for whom verifiable information is available.

Marie Delta’s solo work has been praised in underground music circles for its nostalgic yet modern approach to synth-pop and her ability to create emotionally resonant atmospheres. Her legacy is tied to the Parisian DIY scene, where she has contributed both as a performer and as a creative force behind multiple collaborative projects.
