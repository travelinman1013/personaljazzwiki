## Biography
Jay Douglas is a Jamaican-born, Toronto-based singer, bandleader, and producer whose career has helped define the sound of Caribbean music in Canada for more than five decades.[2][3] Born in Montego Bay, Jamaica, he first performed on stage as a teenager before immigrating to Toronto in the early 1960s to join his mother, who had moved there years earlier to work as a domestic worker.[2][4][5] While attending Central Technical School in Toronto, he began performing locally, and his early shows there led into a steady professional path in the city’s emerging Caribbean and soul music scenes.[3][5] 

Douglas’s career took off when he became the frontman of The Cougars, a group that fused ska, rock steady, reggae, soul, rhythm and blues, and funk, and became a staple of the nightclub circuits in Toronto and Montreal throughout the 1960s and 1970s.[1][2][4][5] Over the years he evolved into a leading figure of the Toronto-Jamaican musical community, performing at major venues such as Massey Hall, Roy Thomson Hall, and the Glenn Gould Studio, as well as festivals around the world from Hong Kong to Cuba.[2][3] His work as leader of the Jay Douglas All-Star Band and as a solo artist has drawn on reggae, soul, blues, and jazz, earning him multiple Canadian Reggae Awards, a Harry Jerome Award for Best Performer, NOW Magazine’s Best R&B Act, and several Juno Award nominations, including recognition for his album *Lovers’ Paradise*.[1][2][3] 

Recognized as a “treasure trove of Toronto-Jamaican musical history,” Douglas has been central to documenting and preserving the story of reggae’s arrival in North America, advising projects such as the Light in the Attic retrospective on early reggae and helping the City of Toronto name Reggae Lane, where he debuted his song “Reggae Lane” at a mural unveiling in 2015.[2][3] His blend of soul-reggae vocals, historical knowledge, and community advocacy has made him a key bridge between generations of Caribbean musicians in Canada, and a respected pioneer whose legacy is now being chronicled in documentaries and archival projects that highlight his role in shaping the country’s Black and Caribbean musical landscape.[2][3][4][5]
