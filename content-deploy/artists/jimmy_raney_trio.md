## Biography
Jimmy Raney (August 20, 1927 – May 10, 1995) was an American jazz guitarist born in Louisville, Kentucky. He began playing guitar at age ten and quickly developed a passion for jazz, landing his first significant job with the Jerry Wald band at just 17 years old. Raney's early career saw him performing with the Max Miller Quartet in Chicago and later joining the Artie Shaw Orchestra and Woody Herman's band, experiences that helped shape his distinctive approach to jazz guitar.[1][2][5]

Raney rose to prominence in the early 1950s as a member of the Red Norvo Trio, where he replaced Tal Farlow, and as a collaborator with saxophonist Stan Getz. His playing is noted for its fluid bebop phrasing, clear articulation, and subtle vibrato technique, which set him apart from his contemporaries. Raney's style spanned cool jazz, bebop, post-bop, hard bop, and mainstream jazz, earning him critical acclaim and two consecutive DownBeat Critics' Poll awards for guitar in 1954 and 1955. Despite battling Ménière's disease, which led to near deafness, Raney continued to perform and record prolifically throughout his career.[1][4][6]

In the 1970s, Raney returned to Louisville and collaborated extensively with his son Doug Raney, also a noted jazz guitarist. His legacy endures through his recordings, innovative technique, and influence on generations of jazz musicians, with The New York Times describing him as "one of the most gifted and influential postwar jazz guitarists in the world."[1][7]
