## Biography
George Coleman, born March 8, 1935, in Memphis, Tennessee, emerged from a vibrant musical environment, surrounded by future jazz luminaries such as Booker Little, Harold Mabern, and Charles Lloyd. Inspired by the revolutionary sound of Charlie Parker, Coleman taught himself the alto saxophone as a teenager and quickly became a prominent figure in the Memphis music scene. By age 17, he was performing with blues legend B.B. King, contributing his saxophone to King's recordings and live shows, and later switching to tenor saxophone at King's request.

In 1956, Coleman moved to Chicago, immersing himself in the city's thriving jazz community and collaborating with artists like Gene Ammons and Johnny Griffin. His career accelerated further after joining Max Roach's quintet and, later, Slide Hampton's band. Coleman reached international prominence in the early 1960s as a member of Miles Davis's legendary quintet, recording seminal albums such as 'Seven Steps to Heaven,' 'My Funny Valentine,' and 'Four & More.' His robust, soulful tone and technical brilliance became hallmarks of his style, blending the bluesy roots of Memphis with the sophisticated harmonies of modern jazz.

Over subsequent decades, Coleman worked with a who's who of jazz, including Herbie Hancock, Lee Morgan, Charles Mingus, and Chet Baker, while also leading his own ensembles and contributing as an arranger and educator. Recognized as an NEA Jazz Master in 2015, Coleman remains an influential figure whose artistry and mentorship have shaped generations of jazz musicians.
