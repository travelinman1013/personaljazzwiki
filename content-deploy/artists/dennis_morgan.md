## Biography
Dennis Morgan, born July 30, 1952 in Tracy, Minnesota, is a prolific American songwriter whose work has spanned both country and pop music. Inspired by seeing The Beatles on The Ed Sullivan Show as a child, Morgan began learning guitar at age 11 and was writing songs and playing in bands by his early teens. At 20, he hitchhiked to Nashville with just forty dollars and a suitcase full of original songs, quickly immersing himself in the city's vibrant music scene as a solo performer in clubs and honky-tonks.

Morgan's career took off in the mid-1970s when his songwriting began attracting the attention of major artists and publishers. He became known for his versatility, contributing not only to country hits for artists like Barbara Mandrell, Charley Pride, and Ronnie Milsap, but also to pop successes, most notably co-writing the Grammy-winning international hit "I Knew You Were Waiting (For Me)" for Aretha Franklin and George Michael. Over the decades, Morgan has built a publishing empire in Nashville, founding several companies that collectively manage a catalog of over 8,000 songs and numerous master recordings.

Morgan's legacy is cemented by his induction into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame and his broad influence across genres. He remains active in songwriting and publishing, with his work recorded by artists ranging from Johnny Cash to Rod Stewart. His career reflects both the collaborative spirit and entrepreneurial drive that define Nashville's music industry.
