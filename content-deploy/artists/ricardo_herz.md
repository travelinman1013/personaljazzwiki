## Biography
Ricardo Steuer Herz, born in 1978 in São Paulo, Brazil, began his musical journey at age 6 at the Fukuda School, laying a strong foundation in classical violin before graduating from the University of São Paulo. He expanded his skills with jazz training at Berklee College of Music in Boston and further studies with French jazz violinist Didier Lockwood at the Centre des Musiques Didier Lockwood in Paris, where he lived from 2002 to 2010. During this period, he immersed himself in international scenes, performing with groups like the forró band Orquestra do Fubá and the jazz/world-music sextet Tekere at major French festivals such as Jazz à Vienne and Jazz à Marciac.[1][2][8]

Returning to Brazil in 2010 after winning the popular jury at the Visa Prize for Brazilian Music in 2004, Herz released his debut solo album *Violino Popular Brasileiro* and developed a distinctive style blending classical precision, jazz improvisation, Brazilian rhythms like choro, forró, baião, and samba, and folk traditions emulating the accordion and rabeca on violin. He has recorded with his Ricardo Herz Trio (*Aqui é o meu lá*, *Torcendo a Terra*), duo albums with artists like Yamandú Costa, Nelson Ayres, Antonio Loureiro, and Samuca do Acordeon, and an album of traditional children's music with the Cantilena Ensemble. As a soloist, he has performed with orchestras including Orquestra Jazz Sinfônica and Orquestra Sinfônica de João Pessoa.[1][2]

Herz is renowned for reinventing Brazilian violin, earning praise from masters like Hamilton de Holanda, Dominguinhos, and Edu Lobo for his virtuosity, swing, and charm. A dedicated educator, he conducts workshops on Brazilian music, promotes the violin in popular genres, and recently launched an online 'Brazilian Popular Violin Course,' cementing his legacy as a pioneer in Brazilian instrumental music.[1][2][3]
