# Georgiana de Moraes

## Quick Info
- **Genres**: bossa nova, brazilian jazz
- **Spotify Popularity**: 1/100
- **Followers**: 49

## Biography
No reliable evidence could be found that **Georgiana de Moraes** is herself an active recording or performing musical artist. Available sources only confirm that **Georgiana** is the third child of the Brazilian poet, lyricist, and diplomat Vinicius de Moraes, a central figure in the creation of bossa nova.[1][2][6]

According to Vinicius de Moraes’s biographies, his daughter Georgiana was born in 1953, during the period in which he was consolidating his literary and diplomatic career and beginning to enter music more actively.[1][2][3][6] These sources briefly mention her birth as part of his personal life timeline but do not discuss her as a musician, composer, or recording artist, nor do they associate her with specific albums, performances, or projects in bossa nova or Brazilian jazz. Because of this, any claim that she has a documented public career as a musical artist would go beyond what is verifiable in credible references.

Given the complete absence of discographies, press coverage, or music-industry references tied specifically to an artist profile under the name "Georgiana de Moraes," it is most accurate to treat her as a **family member of Vinicius de Moraes** rather than as a known professional musician. If there is a Spotify profile under this name, it likely reflects an extremely obscure or misattributed entry rather than a well-documented artist with a traceable biography in recognized sources.

## Fun Facts
- Georgiana is documented in major biographies only as the third child of poet and songwriter Vinicius de Moraes, born in 1953.[1][2][6]
- Her birth coincides with a pivotal phase in Vinicius de Moraes’s life, when he was posted to Paris as a diplomat and beginning to write songs that led into the bossa nova era.[1][2][3]
- While Vinicius’s other public and artistic partnerships are extensively chronicled, there is no parallel documentation of Georgiana as a musical collaborator or artist in standard Brazilian music references.[1][2][3]
