## Biography
Gerald William Clayton, born May 11, 1984, in the Netherlands and raised in the United States, is a Dutch-born American jazz pianist and composer renowned for his harmonic curiosity and honest expression in every note. He formally began his musical journey at the prestigious Los Angeles County High School for the Arts, where he received the 2002 Presidential Scholar of the Arts Award. Continuing his education, he studied intensively with NEA Jazz Master Kenny Barron at The Manhattan School of Music, then earned a Bachelor of Arts in Piano Performance at USC’s Thornton School of Music under Billy Childs and Shelly Berg.[1][2][3][6][9]

Clayton's career gained momentum with second place in the 2006 Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz Piano Competition, followed by his debut album *Two-Shade* (ArtistShare, 2009), which earned a 2010 GRAMMY nomination for Best Improvised Jazz Solo on 'All of You.' Subsequent releases like *Bond: The Paris Sessions* (Concord, 2011), *Life Forum* (Concord, 2012), and his Blue Note debut *Happening: Live at the Village Vanguard* (2020) brought further GRAMMY nominations for Best Jazz Instrumental Album and other categories, totaling six nominations. He also composed 'Battle Circle' for The Clayton Brothers’ *The New Song and Dance* (ArtistShare), nominated in 2011. In 2016-17, he created an evening-length mixed-media piece on Piedmont Blues for Duke University.[1][2][3][4][5][6]

As the son of esteemed bassist and composer John Clayton, Gerald benefited from a familial musical apprenticeship, honoring this legacy through artistic exploration, innovation, and reinvention. His style blends skilled improvisation with visionary composition, evolving across labels like ArtistShare, Concord, and Blue Note, positioning him in the vanguard of younger American jazz musicians.[1][2][5]
