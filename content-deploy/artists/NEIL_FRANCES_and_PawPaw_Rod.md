## Biography
NEIL FRANCES is a Los Angeles-based indie-dance duo formed in 2016 by Australian-born producer Jordan Feller and Southern California native vocalist Marc Gilfry. Initially connecting over a shared love for infectious grooves and danceable pop, the pair quickly gained attention with their debut EP 'Took A While' in 2018, which featured the hit single 'Dumb Love' and a viral cover of Stardust's 'Music Sounds Better With You.' Their music blends elements of house, pop, and funk, characterized by catchy hooks, lush production, and a focus on live instrumentation. Their debut LP, 'There Is No Neil Frances' (2022), and sophomore album, 'It's All a Bit Fuzzy' (2023), further established their reputation for genre-blurring, collaborative work, with the latter featuring artists like PawPaw Rod, dreamcastmoe, and St. Panther.

PawPaw Rod, born in Hawaii and raised in Oklahoma, is a rapper and singer whose sound fuses '60s soul, funk, alternative R&B, and indie pop. Growing up as a military brat, he was exposed to a wide array of musical influences, including Maxwell, Prince, The Gap Band, and Bill Withers. After debuting with the single 'HIT EM WHERE IT HURTS' in 2020, PawPaw Rod quickly amassed a following with his genre-blending style and introspective lyricism. His debut EP, 'A PawPaw Rod EP,' garnered over 100 million streams, and his music has been featured in popular TV shows and commercials. He has continued to build momentum with subsequent EPs and high-profile festival appearances, including collaborations and live performances with NEIL FRANCES.

The collaboration between NEIL FRANCES and PawPaw Rod began with the track 'High' from 'It's All a Bit Fuzzy' and continued with 'High Notes,' both products of a creative synergy that merges NEIL FRANCES' dancefloor sensibility with PawPaw Rod's soulful vocal delivery. Their joint performances, including a notable appearance at Coachella 2024, have been praised for their energy and groove, marking them as standout acts in the contemporary indie and dance music scenes.
