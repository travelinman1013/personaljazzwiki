## Biography
Eartha Mae Kitt (1927–2008) was born in North, South Carolina, into a difficult childhood marked by poverty and uncertainty about her parentage. At eight, she moved to Harlem, New York, where her artistic talents began to flourish. After a brief stint at the New York School of Performing Arts, she joined the Katherine Dunham Dance Troupe at age sixteen, touring internationally and learning to sing in multiple languages[3][1]. Her breakthrough came in the early 1950s, when she became a sensation in Paris nightclubs and was cast by Orson Welles in "Dr. Faust," who famously called her "the most exciting woman in the world"[2][3].

Kitt's career soared as she released iconic songs such as "C'est Si Bon," "Santa Baby," and "I Want to Be Evil," establishing her as a unique voice in jazz, cabaret, and pop music[2][1]. Her sultry vocal style, stage charisma, and multilingual repertoire made her a global star. She achieved further fame as Catwoman in the 1960s "Batman" television series and earned nominations for Grammy, Emmy, and Tony Awards[2][3][5]. Kitt was also a committed civil rights advocate, refusing to perform for segregated audiences and speaking out against the Vietnam War at a White House luncheon in 1968, which led to her being blacklisted in the U.S. for a decade[3][4][7].

Despite setbacks, Kitt returned triumphantly to Broadway in the late 1970s and continued to perform, write autobiographies, and act in films and television. In her later years, she found new audiences through voice acting, most notably as Yzma in "The Emperor's New Groove," earning multiple Daytime Emmy Awards[2]. Eartha Kitt's legacy endures as a trailblazing entertainer who broke racial barriers and inspired generations with her artistry and activism.
