## Biography
Leandro Sapucahy is a Brazilian singer, composer, percussionist, and producer rooted in the samba and pagode traditions of Rio de Janeiro. Born in the neighborhood of Jacarepaguá, in the West Zone of Rio, he began his artistic career in 1986 at age 16, joining the pagode group Água na Boca, which later changed its name to Boca Louca.[1] Beyond performing, he quickly stood out as a musical producer, overseeing Boca Louca’s debut CD “Boca Louca de verdade,” which sold around 130,000 copies and earned a Gold Record, opening doors for him to produce several other romantic pagode groups that dominated Brazil’s 1990s charts.[1] During this period he also worked as an assistant to producer Bira Havai on multiple romantic pagode albums, consolidating his behind-the-scenes reputation, and performed as a percussionist both live and in the studio with artists including rapper Marcelo D2.[1]

In 2006 Sapucahy created the roda de samba Sapucapeta, initially held in front of fashion designer Isabela Capeto’s shop in Leblon; the project grew into a full band and became part of Rio de Janeiro’s official pre‑Carnival circuit, touring various Brazilian cities.[1] That same year he toured Europe as percussionist for Marcelo D2 and released his first solo album, “Cotidiano,” which featured Arlindo Cruz on the track “Polícia e bandido,” later used on the soundtrack of José Padilha’s film “Tropa de Elite.”[1] As a producer he achieved major recognition in 2007 with Maria Rita’s samba album “Samba Meu,” which he co‑produced and which went on to win the 2008 Latin Grammy Award for Best Samba/Pagode Album and achieve platinum status in Brazil.[1][3] He continued to release his own projects, including the CD/DVD “Favela Brasil” (2008), with arrangements by Jota Moraes and guests such as Serginho Meriti, Mano Brown, MC Marcinho, and Fernandinho Beatbox, and the live CD/DVD “O Baile do Sapuca” (2012), recorded at Marina da Glória with appearances by Marcelo D2, Naldo, Preta Gil, Emicida, and Fernanda Abreu.[1]

Sapucahy’s work blends traditional samba and pagode with elements of funk carioca, hip‑hop, and pop, often focusing on the daily reality of Rio’s favelas and urban periphery.[1][2] In 2010 his samba‑enredo “Esta noite levarei sua alma,” co‑written with Serginho Meriti and Ronaldo Carvalho, was chosen as the official samba for Unidos da Tijuca’s 2011 Carnival parade, reinforcing his stature within the samba‑school universe.[1] He also became musical director of the Sunday TV show “Esquenta!,” hosted by Regina Casé on Rede Globo, a high‑profile role that placed him at the center of mainstream representations of Afro‑Brazilian popular culture.[1] Subsequent releases like “Favela Brasil II” (2013), featuring Xande de Pilares and Serginho Meriti, and the album “Eu amo a vida” (2015), issued by Deck with compositions by writers such as André Renato, Ronaldo Barcelos, Diney, and Tico, further cemented his reputation as a versatile author, bandleader, and producer within contemporary samba and pagode.[1]

## Fun Facts
- Sapucahy began his career at just 16 in the pagode group Água na Boca, later renamed Boca Louca, and produced their debut album “Boca Louca de verdade,” which sold about 130,000 copies and earned a Gold Record—an unusually rapid breakthrough for a teenager in the genre.[1]
- His track “Polícia e bandido,” featuring Arlindo Cruz on his first solo album “Cotidiano,” was selected for the soundtrack of José Padilha’s film “Tropa de Elite,” one of the most influential Brazilian films of the 2000s, bringing his samba into a gritty cinematic context.[1]
- The roda de samba Sapucapeta that he founded in front of fashion designer Isabela Capeto’s boutique in Leblon grew so much that it became a full band and an official part of Rio de Janeiro’s pre‑Carnival schedule, later touring multiple Brazilian cities.[1]
- Beyond records and stages, Sapucahy has had a major behind‑the‑scenes impact as musical director of the popular TV show “Esquenta!,” curating performances that showcased samba, pagode, funk, and other strands of Brazilian pop culture to a nationwide Sunday‑afternoon audience.[1]
