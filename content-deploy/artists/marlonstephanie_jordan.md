## Biography
Marlon Jordan, born August 21, 1970, in New Orleans, Louisiana, is the youngest of seven children in a musical family led by his father, avant-garde saxophonist and educator Edward 'Kidd' Jordan, and mother Edvidge Jordan, a classical pianist. Initially experimenting with saxophone, violin, and drums, he settled on the trumpet, drawing daily inspiration from visitors like Wynton Marsalis and Terence Blanchard at the family home. He graduated from the New Orleans Center for the Creative Arts (NOCCA), performed classical solos with the New Orleans Symphony Orchestra as a teenager, and immersed himself in New Orleans' street and nightclub scenes.[1][2][3][4]

At age 17, Jordan signed with Columbia Records (Sony) as one of the 'Young Jazz Lions,' releasing his acclaimed debut *For You Only* in 1988 (or 1990 per some sources), featuring Branford Marsalis and brother Kent Jordan, praised by the Washington Post as one of the year's best debuts. He followed with *Learson's Return* (1991) and *The Undaunted* (1992), touring his quintet at major venues like the Village Vanguard, Blue Note, and JVC Jazz Festivals alongside Wynton Marsalis, Miles Davis, and George Benson. After a hiatus, he returned in 1997 with *Marlon's Mode* on Arabesque and in 2005 with *You Don't Know What Love Is* on Louisiana Red Hot Records, featuring his sister Stephanie Jordan's vocal debut, alongside family members.[3][4][5]

Jordan's style blends hard bop with clean, boppish trumpet lines influenced by the jazz tradition, Charlie Parker, and John Coltrane, while maintaining classical proficiency, performing with orchestras and in Brazil. He continues performing in New Orleans clubs, teaches at schools like Baptiste and Don Jamison, and upholds his family's jazz legacy.[1][2][6]
