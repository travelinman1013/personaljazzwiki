## Biography
Delfeayo Marsalis & the Uptown Jazz Orchestra is a New Orleans–based big band led by trombonist, composer, producer, and educator **Delfeayo Marsalis**, a member of the city’s famed Marsalis musical family.[2][6][7] Marsalis, born in New Orleans on July 28, 1965, grew up under the guidance of his pianist father Ellis Marsalis Jr. and alongside his brothers Branford, Wynton, and Jason, immersing himself in both modern jazz and the deep traditions of his hometown.[4][5][6][7] After formal music studies that culminated in a master’s degree in music performance from the University of Louisville, he built a dual career as a leading post‑bop trombonist and a prolific record producer, working on more than 100 recordings for artists such as Harry Connick Jr., Terence Blanchard, the Preservation Hall Jazz Band, and his own family.[3][4][5] His trombone style reflects the influence of J.J. Johnson and Slide Hampton, and he honed his craft on tour with bandleaders including Ray Charles, Art Blakey, Max Roach, Elvin Jones, and Abdullah Ibrahim.[3][4][5]

Marsalis founded the **Uptown Jazz Orchestra (UJO)** in 2007–2008 to keep key New Orleans and big‑band traditions alive—riff‑based ensemble playing, collective improvisation, and classic instrumental polyphony—while giving opportunities to a multi‑generational pool of local musicians.[1][2][4][5] The 16‑piece ensemble quickly became a fixture at Snug Harbor Jazz Bistro in New Orleans and developed a repertoire that spans traditional New Orleans jazz, swing, modern big‑band arrangements, and original works infused with second‑line funk and Mardi Gras spirit.[2][4][5][8] Together they have released several acclaimed albums, including *Make America Great Again!* (2016), *Jazz Party* (2020), and *Uptown on Mardi Gras Day* (2023), all of which won OffBeat magazine’s Best Contemporary Jazz Album award and showcase the band’s blend of tight arrangements, humor, political and social commentary, and exuberant New Orleans grooves.[4][6]

Beyond performance, Marsalis and the Uptown Jazz Orchestra are deeply committed to education and community engagement. Marsalis created programs such as “Swinging with the Cool School” and founded Uptown Music Theatre and Keep New Orleans Music Alive to introduce young people to jazz, support local culture bearers, and use music as a tool for empowerment and healing.[1][3][4][5] Since 2021, the UJO has produced the annual **Jazz at Congo Square Festival**, presenting New Orleans musicians, poets, dancers, and Black Masking Indians alongside local food and arts vendors, further cementing the orchestra’s role as a cultural ambassador for the city’s Black musical heritage.[1] In this way, Delfeayo Marsalis & the Uptown Jazz Orchestra function not only as a modern big band but also as a living institution dedicated to preserving, refreshing, and transmitting the New Orleans jazz tradition to new generations.[1][2][4][5][8]
