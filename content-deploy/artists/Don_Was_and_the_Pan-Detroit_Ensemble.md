## Biography
Don Was and the Pan-Detroit Ensemble is the latest project from legendary Detroit musician, producer, and Blue Note Records president Don Was. Born Don Edward Fagenson in Detroit in 1952, Was grew up immersed in the city’s vibrant musical culture, absorbing influences from blues, jazz, soul, and the raw energy of Detroit’s streets. He first rose to prominence as co-founder of the funk-soul group Was (Not Was), which achieved commercial success in the 1980s with hits like 'Walk the Dinosaur.'

After decades as a Grammy-winning producer for artists such as Bonnie Raitt, The Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, and Willie Nelson, Was returned to his roots with the Pan-Detroit Ensemble—a collective of top-tier jazz and soul musicians from Detroit. The group embodies the city’s signature groove, blending soul-jazz, roots rock, and improvisational spirit. Their debut album, released in 2025, marks the first time Was’s name has appeared as the lead artist on a recording, despite his nearly fifty-year career. The band’s sound is characterized by a rawness and lack of pretension, reflecting Detroit’s musical heritage and the collaborative energy of its members.

The Pan-Detroit Ensemble features long-time collaborators such as saxophonist Dave McMurray and keyboardist Luis Resto (known for his work with Eminem), alongside Vincent Chandler (trombone), John Douglas (trumpet), Jeff Canady (drums), Mahindi Masai (percussion), Wayne Gerard (guitar), and Steffanie Christi’an (vocals). Their performances and recordings celebrate Detroit’s musical diversity, drawing enthusiastic audiences both locally and internationally, including a recent tour in Japan with Norah Jones. Don Was’s legacy as a connector, innovator, and ambassador for Detroit music continues through this ensemble, which stands as a testament to the city’s enduring influence on American music.
