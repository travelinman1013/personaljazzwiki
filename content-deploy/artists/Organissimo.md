## Biography
Organissimo is a soul-jazz organ trio that formed in November 2000 in Lansing, Michigan, with the goal of bringing jazz back to the people. The group was founded by organist Jim Alfredson and drummer Randy Marsh, establishing a sound that is instantly identifiable yet constantly evolving. Alfredson, who comes from a musical family, began his journey with music at age four, pulling on the drawbars of his father's Hammond B3 organ. His father, a professional musician, encouraged Jim's talents from a very young age. The founding lineup included guitarist Joe Gloss, creating the core trio format centered around the powerful Hammond B3 organ that would define their signature sound.

Over their 25-year career, Organissimo has become known throughout the Midwest as a premier soul-jazz ensemble, fluidly covering a range of jazz styles including funky soul jazz, jazz-funk, contemporary jazz, and jam-oriented performances. The group's sound seamlessly melds jazz, blues, gospel, and even hints of progressive rock and fusion. Their ensemble interplay and solo improvisation, honed from years of playing on the road together, showcase near-telepathic reactions between members. Throughout their history, the band has featured three different guitarists: original member Joe Gloss, Ralph Tope, and current guitarist Larry Barris (also known as Lawrence Barris), who joined as the newest member and has contributed heavily to the band's arrangements. Randy Marsh, known throughout Michigan as the drummer of choice, has been drumming for almost 40 years and brings fire, intensity, and his trademark sense of humor to the group, drawing inspiration from his hero Art Blakey.

Organissimo has released multiple acclaimed albums including their debut studio work, followed by "This Is The Place" (2005), which won WYCE Jammie Awards for Best Jazz Album and Album of the Year, "Groovadelphia" (2008), which topped the CMJ Jazz Charts for three weeks at #1 and won two WYCE Jammie Awards, "Alive & Kickin'!" recorded live at WKAR-TV, and "B3tles - A Soulful Tribute to the Fab Four" (2016), featuring creative arrangements of Beatles classics. Jim Alfredson received the 2021 JAZZ JAMM award for Significant Contributions to Jazz in Mid-Michigan, coinciding with the band's 20th anniversary celebration. Beyond Organissimo, Alfredson has collaborated with major artists including D'Angelo, John Mayer, Frank Ocean, and Christian McBride, and works as a piano tuner/technician in the Lansing area when not performing.

## Fun Facts
- Jim Alfredson's earliest memories include pulling on the drawbars of his father's Hammond B3 organ at the age of four, beginning his lifelong relationship with the instrument.
- The concept for their Beatles tribute album 'B3tles' came about while the band was traveling the highways of the American South returning from a festival in Tupelo, Mississippi in 2016, passing the time listening to their favorite Beatles songs and discussing how to arrange them for organ trio format.
- On 'B3tles,' the band arranged 'Taxman' in 7/8 time instead of the original 4/4, with Paul McCartney's iconic bassline squeezed into the unusual time signature while deftly shifting back and forth between signatures.
- Randy Marsh, when not behind the drums, enjoys biking the trails and kayaking the rivers in the wilds of Michigan, maintaining an active outdoor lifestyle alongside his nearly 40-year drumming career.
- Jim Alfredson works as a piano tuner/technician in the Lansing area when not on the road, combining his technical knowledge with his performing career, and lives with his wife Alison and daughters Zora, Stella, and Scarlett.
