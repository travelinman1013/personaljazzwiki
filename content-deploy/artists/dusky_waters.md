## Biography
Dusky Waters is the nom de plume of contemporary Americana singer‑songwriter **Jenn Jeffers**, whose work draws deeply on a life spent along the Mississippi River and its tributaries.[1][4] Raised on the banks of the Arkansas River in Little Rock, she later lived in the delta of northern Louisiana before settling in **New Orleans, Louisiana**, a geography that shapes both her storytelling and sound.[1][4] In interviews she frames her songs as reflections on navigating the 2020s as a Black, Southern millennial woman, combining personal narratives with broader meditations on place, identity, and history.[3][6] Her project name “Dusky Waters” reflects her affinity for twilight hours and the river that has anchored her life’s journey.[1]

As a recording and performing artist, Dusky Waters has developed a distinctive blend of **Americana**, absorbing elements of **gospel, folk, soul, New Orleans blues, and contemporary pop arrangements** into a fresh, harmony‑rich sound.[1][4] Her 2023 album *Pass It On* captures “special and pivotal moments in time” in her life, including relationship transitions and questions of how to move through an uncertain era.[3][7] OffBeat Magazine has praised her music as “beautifully crafted” and “sublime,” highlighting her “clarion call vocals” and the way her live shows turn audiences into “a sea of movement.”[1][4] In 2024 she and her band made their New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival debut to a packed Rhythmporium Tent, reinforcing her growing profile in the regional Americana scene.[1]

Beyond recording, Dusky Waters leads a collaborative ensemble that includes Analiese Desaw (viola, vocals), Conner McCready (percussion), Hannah Kreiger‑Benson (piano, organ), and Dylan James (upright bass), using banjo, guitar, accordion, viola, upright bass, piano, and percussion to support her candid, emotionally open songwriting.[1] She is also the co‑founder of **BlackAmericana Fest** in New Orleans, a festival and nonprofit dedicated to centering Black artists within Americana and roots music and to exploring the historic and ongoing role of Black venues, the Chitlin Circuit, and Southern folk traditions.[1][2][5] Through both her music and her curatorial work, she has become a prominent voice in contemporary Southern Americana, articulating what she calls “the magic and mourning of the bayou state” and hopeful odes to self‑actualization.[1][2][7]

## Fun Facts
- “Dusky Waters” is not her real name but a nom de plume chosen to express both her love of twilight and the central role of the Mississippi River in her life story.[1]
- Her songs draw on a life lived up and down the Mississippi system: from childhood on the Arkansas River in Little Rock, to years in the Louisiana delta, to her current home in New Orleans.[1][4]
- She is the co‑founder of BlackAmericana Fest in New Orleans, a festival‑turned‑nonprofit created to spotlight Black voices in Americana and roots music and to host panels on topics like the Chitlin Circuit and historic Black venues.[1][2][5]
- Her album *Pass It On* includes the song “How Will We Know?,” inspired by a hiking trip in the Smoky Mountains, where the landscape’s beauty and uncertainty became a metaphor for the end of a long‑term relationship.[3][7]
