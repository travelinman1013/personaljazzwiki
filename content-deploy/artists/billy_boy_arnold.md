## Biography
Billy Boy Arnold, born William Arnold on September 16, 1935, in Chicago, Illinois, is a seminal figure in the history of blues music and one of the few major artists to hail directly from Chicago rather than migrating from the South[1][4][5]. Fascinated by the blues from a young age, Arnold was deeply inspired by the music he heard on local jukeboxes and by harmonica legend John Lee 'Sonny Boy' Williamson, whom he met as a preteen. This formative encounter ignited Arnold’s passion for the harmonica and set him on a path to become a blues musician[3][6]. By his teens, Arnold was already performing and soon made his first recordings, quickly establishing himself as a prominent harmonica player and vocalist in the burgeoning Chicago blues scene[4][7].

Arnold’s career accelerated in the early 1950s when he joined Bo Diddley’s band and played harmonica on Diddley’s iconic Chess Records sessions, including 'I’m a Man' and 'Bo Diddley,' which helped shape the sound of early rock and roll[1][3][4]. Determined to forge his own path, Arnold signed with VeeJay Records and released influential singles such as 'I Wish You Would' and 'I Ain’t Got You,' which became regional hits and were later covered by British Invasion bands like The Yardbirds and The Animals[1][2][3]. Despite his early success, Arnold faced challenges in the music business and took on various jobs outside music, but he continued to record and perform, eventually touring Europe and enjoying renewed interest from blues and rock audiences in the 1970s and beyond[1][2].

Arnold’s musical style is defined by his expressive harmonica playing, soulful vocals, and a songwriting approach that blends Delta blues roots with urban sophistication[1][3]. His legacy is profound: he contributed to the evolution of Chicago blues, played a pivotal role in the birth of rock and roll, and helped bridge the gap between Black blues traditions and white audiences, both in America and abroad[2][4]. Arnold’s original songs have been covered by artists ranging from Eric Clapton and David Bowie to Aerosmith and The Blues Brothers, cementing his influence across generations and genres[2][3].
