## Biography
Frankie Beverly & Maze is an iconic American soul and R&B group led by Howard 'Frankie' Beverly, whose smooth vocals and songwriting defined the band's signature sound. Born in Philadelphia in 1946, Beverly began his musical journey singing in church and forming doo-wop groups like The Blenders and The Butlers during his teens. After moderate local success, Beverly moved to California in the early 1970s, seeking broader opportunities. There, he formed the band Raw Soul, which later became Maze after being discovered and mentored by Marvin Gaye. Gaye's support, including taking the band on tour as his opening act, was pivotal in launching Maze's national career.

Maze featuring Frankie Beverly released their debut album in 1977, quickly earning acclaim for their unique blend of soul, R&B, and funk. Throughout the late 1970s and 1980s, the group released a string of gold albums and classic singles such as 'Joy and Pain,' 'Before I Let Go,' and 'Happy Feelin’s.' Their music is characterized by heartfelt lyrics, infectious grooves, and a 'quiet storm' style that resonated deeply with audiences. Renowned for their electrifying live performances, Maze developed a devoted following and became a staple of the R&B concert circuit, even as mainstream chart-topping success eluded them.

Frankie Beverly & Maze's legacy is cemented by their influence on subsequent generations of R&B and soul artists, their enduring popularity, and their reputation for musical integrity and authenticity. Their songs remain anthems within the genre, and their impact is evident in the work of contemporary musicians who cite Beverly and Maze as inspirations.
