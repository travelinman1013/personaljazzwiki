## Biography
Based on available historical and discographical evidence, there does not appear to be a documented ragtime artist named “Catherine Henderson.” The closest documented figure is **Katherine Henderson** (sometimes misspelled as Catherine in discographical notes), an American classic female blues singer active in the late 1920s–1940s.[1][2][4][5] She was born on June 23, 1909, in St. Louis, Missouri, and was the niece of prominent musicians Eva Taylor and Clarence Williams, which placed her within a significant African American musical family network from an early age.[1][2][4][5] As a child she performed in minstrel shows and on the vaudeville circuit, gaining stage experience before entering the recording studio.[1][2][5]

Henderson’s recording career was brief but notable: she cut around ten titles in 1927–1928 for Brunswick and QRS, mostly in Long Island City, New York, often under the musical direction of Clarence Williams and with his bands.[1][2][4][5] She appeared in the 1927 New York stage musical *Bottomland*, written by Williams, alongside Eva Taylor and Sara Martin, and recorded the show’s song “Take Your Black Bottom Dance Outside.”[1][2][4][5] Her repertoire placed her squarely in the **classic female blues** idiom rather than ragtime, although she worked with musicians rooted in early jazz and syncopated styles. Critic Derrick Stewart‑Baxter later described her vocal approach as somewhat theatrical and overly sentimental, yet her records remain of interest for their association with Clarence Williams and players such as King Oliver.[1][4] She married John Jackson in 1928 and continued to perform on stage into the mid‑1940s, long after her short recording phase ended.[1][2][4][5]

Importantly, specialist discographical research explicitly notes that she is **not** the “Catherine Henderson” who appears on two Okeh sides recorded in Atlanta in 1925; those sides are credited compositionally to Edmonia Henderson, and the Catherine on those Okeh discs is considered a different singer.[4] Modern reference works and discographies therefore treat Katherine Henderson as a St. Louis–born classic blues vocalist tied to Clarence Williams’ circle, with no primary sources linking her career specifically to ragtime as a genre label. The Spotify credit of “CATHERINE HENDERSON” tagged as ragtime most likely reflects a metadata conflation or spelling variant of Katherine Henderson, rather than evidence of a distinct ragtime artist.

## Fun Facts
- Specialist discographers emphasize that Katherine Henderson is **not** the same singer as the "Catherine Henderson" on two 1925 Okeh sides recorded in Atlanta; those recordings are linked compositionally to Edmonia Henderson, highlighting how similar names in early blues discographies can be easily confused.[4]
- Her song "Take Your Black Bottom Dance Outside" came from the Clarence Williams musical *Bottomland*, so her commercial recording preserves repertoire from an otherwise ill‑fated stage show that quickly disappeared from the theater circuit.[1][2][4][5]
- Critic Derrick Stewart‑Baxter described her performance style as having "more than a suspicion of ham" and "lachrymose" delivery, indicating that even within the classic blues field her singing was heard as unusually theatrical.[1]
- Although her known recording career centers on about ten sides from 1927–1928, she reportedly continued performing on stage into the mid‑1940s, meaning that most of her professional life exists only in live performance history rather than on record.[1][2][4][5]
