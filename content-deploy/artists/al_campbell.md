## Biography
Al Campbell, born on 31 August 1954 in Kingston, Jamaica, began his musical journey singing in church where his father was a preacher, using his voice to raise funds. Immersed in Jamaica's vibrant reggae scene from an early age, he was influenced by icons like Bob Marley, Dennis Brown, and John Holt. As a teenager, he attended school with Lloyd James (Prince Jammy) and formed the vocal group The Thrillers, recording for Studio One in the late 1960s. His early career included brief stints with Freddie McGregor and Ernest Wilson, followed by work with Prince Lincoln Thompson’s Royal Rasses and the Mighty Cloud band.[1][2]

Campbell's breakthrough arrived in the 1970s as a solo roots reggae artist, recording for producers such as Coxsone Dodd, Bunny Lee, Phil Pratt, Joe Gibbs, and at Lee 'Scratch' Perry’s Black Ark studio; he also contributed vocals to two Heptones albums. Hits like 'Gee Baby' (1975) and 'No More Running' propelled him to stardom in Jamaica and the UK, blending reggae with soul and R&B elements. Adapting to lovers rock and early dancehall in the late 1970s and 1980s, he collaborated with Linval Thompson, releasing tracks like 'Late Night Blues' (1980), a blues party staple, and performed with the Stur-Gav sound system.[1][2]

Throughout the 1980s, 1990s, and beyond, Campbell worked with Sly & Robbie, King Jammy, Philip 'Fatis' Burrell, and Mafia & Fluxy, maintaining a prolific output. In 1997, he reunited with Cornell Campbell and Jimmy Riley in a new version of The Uniques, releasing a self-titled album in 1999. Despite personal challenges, his soulful vocals, rhythmic precision, and socially conscious songwriting have cemented his legacy in reggae, with ongoing tours in Europe and North America but no performances in Jamaica since before Jack Ruby's death.[1][2]
