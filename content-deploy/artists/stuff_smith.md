## Biography
Hezekiah Leroy Gordon Smith, known professionally as Stuff Smith, was born on August 14, 1909, in Portsmouth, Ohio, to a middle-class African-American family where both parents were musically inclined—his father worked as a barber and his mother as a teacher.[1][2] Smith gained his lifelong nickname from his youthful habit of forgetting people's names and calling them "Stuff." He began his professional career in the late 1920s with the Alphonso Trent Orchestra, a traveling territory band based in Dallas, making his recording debut in 1928 and 1930.[2] During this period, he absorbed the influence of jazz trumpeter Louis Armstrong, who became his primary inspiration and stylistic model.[1] After a brief stint with Jelly Roll Morton in the late 1920s—which he left because he felt his violin could not be heard over Morton's large ensemble—Smith returned to Trent's orchestra before establishing himself in Buffalo, New York in 1930, where he led his own band for five years and became a leading figure in the local African-American musical community.[2][3]

Smith achieved stardom in 1936 when he moved to New York City and formed a sextet with his lifelong friend, trumpeter Jonah Jones, taking a residency at the legendary Onyx Club on 52nd Street.[2][4] During his "glory years" from 1936 to 1940, he recorded for Vocalion, Decca, and Varsity labels, achieving a major hit with "I'se A Muggin'" and being billed as Stuff Smith and his Onyx Club Boys.[1] He is credited as the first violinist to use electric amplification techniques on a violin, a pioneering innovation that expanded the instrument's sonic possibilities in jazz.[1] Smith's playing style was characterized by drive, intensity, and invention, though his harsh and aggressive tone never achieved the commercial appeal of contemporaries like Stephane Grappelli.[4] During the 1940s, he organized chamber jazz trios and worked with notable musicians including pianist Jimmy Jones and bassist John Levy, while also collaborating with Fats Waller's band during the war years.[3] Though he remained a swing player throughout his life, his adventurous approach earned admiration from the bebop generation, and he performed at the 1966 Violin Summit alongside Grappelli, Svend Asmussen, and Jean-Luc Ponty.[4]

After experiencing a decline in popularity during the 1950s and early 1960s, Smith relocated to Europe in 1965, settling in Copenhagen, Denmark, where he discovered renewed recognition and constant work opportunities.[2] He was celebrated as a living legend on the European continent and continued performing at a high level despite ongoing health problems, including liver ailments.[2] Smith remained active as a performer until his death on September 25, 1967, in Munich, Germany, at the age of 58.[1][2] He was inducted into The National Fiddler Hall of Fame in 2014, cementing his legacy as one of the three great swing violinists of the early twentieth century alongside Joe Venuti and Stephane Grappelli.[1][4]
