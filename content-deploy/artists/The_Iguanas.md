## Biography
The Iguanas were an American garage rock band formed in Ann Arbor, Michigan, in 1963, best known as the launching pad for Iggy Pop's legendary career. The group began as a duo with Jim Osterberg (later known as Iggy Pop) on drums and Jim McLaughlin on lead guitar and vocals, later expanding to include Nick Kolokithas (rhythm guitar), Don Swickerath (bass), and Sam Swisher (saxophone). Their energetic performances at high school dances and University of Michigan fraternity parties quickly made them one of the most popular teen bands in Michigan by 1965, especially after releasing their single "Mona" b/w "I Don't Know Why" on their own Forte Records label[2][1].

The Iguanas' musical style was rooted in British Invasion pop and garage rock, with covers of the Beatles, Rolling Stones, and Kinks, as well as R&B standards. Their sound, characterized by sharp instrumentals and matching sharkskin suits, reflected the evolving tastes of mid-1960s youth culture. However, as psychedelic and blues-based rock gained popularity, the Iguanas' style began to fall out of favor. Internal creative tensions, especially around original songwriting, led to Osterberg's departure in 1966 to join the Prime Movers, marking the end of the band's most influential period. The Iguanas disbanded in 1967 after a failed record deal, but their legacy was cemented by later recognition, including induction into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends Hall of Fame in 2018 and the release of a compilation album by Norton Records in 1996[2][3][1].

The Iguanas are remembered not only for their regional success but for their pivotal role in shaping the early career of Iggy Pop, whose nickname originated from his time in the band. Their lone single is now part of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's permanent collection, and their story is celebrated as an essential chapter in Michigan's rock history[3][2].
