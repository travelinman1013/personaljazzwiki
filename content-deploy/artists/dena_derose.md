## Biography
Dena DeRose is an acclaimed American jazz pianist, vocalist, composer, and educator, born in Binghamton, New York. She began playing piano at the age of three, encouraged by her family, and was soon exploring a range of musical styles including classical, pop, and jazz. Her fascination with jazz was sparked in her teenage years by the music of Count Basie, and she honed her skills through high school stage bands and local gigs, even playing in pop and wedding bands from a young age. DeRose studied classical piano at Harper College (now Binghamton University) in the mid-1980s, but her passion for jazz grew as she immersed herself in the genre, transcribing solos by jazz greats and spending countless hours practicing and listening to records.

Her early career was marked by both ambition and adversity. Intense practice led to severe carpal tunnel syndrome and arthritis, requiring multiple surgeries and forcing her to stop playing piano for nearly two years. During this hiatus, DeRose discovered her vocal talent—initially singing at a local club on a dare—which became a defining element of her artistry. Once her hands healed, she integrated singing and piano into her performances, developing a unique style that blends sophisticated piano technique with expressive jazz vocals. In 1991, she moved to New York City, where she built her reputation through relentless gigging and eventually released her debut album, 'Introducing Dena DeRose,' in 1996. Since then, she has recorded multiple albums as a leader and performed at prestigious venues and festivals worldwide.

DeRose is also a respected educator, serving as the head of the vocal jazz department at the University of Music and Dramatic Arts in Graz, Austria, and teaching at institutions such as the Manhattan School of Music and The New School. Her musical style is rooted in straight-ahead jazz, with influences from both classic and modern jazz pianists and vocalists. She is celebrated for her inventive arrangements, lyrical phrasing, and ability to connect deeply with audiences, leaving a lasting impact on the jazz community both as a performer and teacher.
