# Diamond Joe

## Quick Info
- **Genres**: afropiano, afro adura, afrobeats, afrobeat
- **Spotify Popularity**: 47/100
- **Followers**: 2,532
- **Born**: New Orleans, Louisiana, United States

## Biography
Available research indicates that “Diamond Joe” is primarily known as the stage name of **Joseph Maryland**, a New Orleans soul singer active in the 1960s, rather than an afrobeats/afropiano artist, and there is no reliable evidence that an African afrobeats musician currently using the name “Diamond Joe” has an established public biography yet.[1][3] Joseph Maryland, nicknamed Diamond Joe, recorded a small but respected run of soul 45s in New Orleans between 1961 and 1968, produced by local figures associated with the city’s R&B scene, and his work has since attracted collectors and deep‑soul enthusiasts.[1][3] Some accounts describe him as a talented vocalist and songwriter who, despite releasing only a handful of singles, left an outsized impression on aficionados of New Orleans soul.[1]

His recorded output was brief, and he did not achieve mainstream national fame during his lifetime; as a result, details about his early life, personal background, and later years are sparse in surviving documentation.[1][3] Retrospectives emphasize the quality of his vocal performances and the strength of specific singles rather than a long, detailed career narrative, and he is often mentioned in the context of rare-soul discographies and obituaries that underline how little is concretely known about his biography beyond his New Orleans roots and his short 1960s recording career.[1][3] Because current public sources do not document an afrobeats/afropiano artist named Diamond Joe with verifiable personal and career history, it is not possible to supply an accurate, sourced biography for the Spotify-listed African “Diamond Joe” without risking conflation with the 1960s New Orleans soul singer.

Given this evidence, any attempt to merge the Spotify afrobeats profile with Joseph Maryland’s 1960s New Orleans soul career would be speculative and misleading. Until credible, independent sources emerge specifically about an afropiano/afrobeats artist called Diamond Joe, the only verifiable biographical information pertains to Joseph Maryland, the New Orleans soul singer known as Diamond Joe, whose legacy now resides mainly in collectors’ circles and specialist writing on rare New Orleans R&B.[1][3]

## Fun Facts
- Diamond Joe is documented in reliable sources as **Joseph Maryland**, a New Orleans soul singer active in the 1960s, not as an afrobeats or afropiano artist.[1][3]
- Collectors and rare-soul writers frequently cite his limited run of 45 RPM singles from 1961–1968 as prized examples of New Orleans deep soul.[1][3]
- Very little is known publicly about his early life or post‑1960s activities, which makes him a somewhat mysterious cult figure in New Orleans soul history.[1][3]
