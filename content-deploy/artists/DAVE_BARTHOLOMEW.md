## Biography
David Louis Bartholomew was born on December 24, 1918, in Edgard, Louisiana, a small town on the outskirts of New Orleans. Originally learning the tuba from his father, Bartholomew switched to trumpet and received instruction from Peter Davis, the same music teacher who had tutored Louis Armstrong. By age 14, he was already performing with some of the South's most popular bands, including Papa Celestin's and Joe Robichaux's groups. In 1939, he joined Fats Pichon's band aboard the riverboat SS Capitol, traveling up and down the Mississippi River between St. Paul, Minnesota, and New Orleans. He also performed briefly with the Jimmy Lunceford Orchestra before serving in World War II with the 196th Army Ground Forces Band, where he developed his writing and arranging skills.

After the war, Bartholomew returned to New Orleans and formed his own band in November 1945, Dave Bartholomew and the Dew Droppers, named after the Dew Drop Inn. The band became "the bedrock of R&B in the city" and served as a model for early rock and roll bands worldwide. In 1947, he began recording at Cosimo Matassa's studio and met Lew Chudd of Imperial Records. His fateful partnership with Fats Domino began when he discovered the pianist performing at the Hideaway Club in New Orleans. Together, they created "The Fat Man" in 1949, which sold over one million copies and is considered by many to be one of the first rock and roll records. Throughout the mid-1950s, Bartholomew and Domino wrote more than 40 hits for Imperial Records, including the Billboard number-one pop hit "Ain't That a Shame" in 1955.

Bartholomew was a true pioneer who bridged the gap between jump blues, swing, and rhythm and blues, ultimately helping to create rock and roll. His "Big Beat" sound, characterized by a heavy backbeat and powerful horn arrangements, influenced countless musicians. Beyond his work with Domino, he composed and produced hits for numerous artists, including "I Hear You Knocking," "Blue Monday," "I'm Walkin'," and "My Ding-a-Ling." His combination of New Orleans jazz traditions with modern rhythm and blues helped bring Black and white audiences together on the dance floor. Bartholomew was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1991, the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame. He remained active in the New Orleans music scene throughout the second half of the 20th century and passed away on June 23, 2019, at the age of 100.
