## Biography
Terence Blanchard, born March 13, 1962, in New Orleans, Louisiana, is a distinguished jazz trumpeter, composer, bandleader, and educator. Raised in a musically rich environment—his father was a part-time opera singer—Blanchard began piano lessons at age five before switching to trumpet at eight. He attended the New Orleans Center for Creative Arts, where he studied under Roger Dickerson and Ellis Marsalis, Jr., and later continued his education at Rutgers University, studying with Paul Jeffrey and Bill Fielder. Early in his career, he played with the Lionel Hampton Orchestra and, on Wynton Marsalis’s recommendation, joined Art Blakey’s Jazz Messengers in 1982, eventually serving as the band’s musical director.

Blanchard rose to prominence in the 1980s jazz resurgence, co-leading a quintet with saxophonist Donald Harrison and recording several acclaimed albums. He is renowned for his versatility, composing more than 80 film and television scores—most notably for director Spike Lee, including 'BlacKkKlansman' and 'Da 5 Bloods,' both of which earned him Academy Award nominations. Blanchard has also composed operas, including 'Fire Shut Up in My Bones,' which became the first opera by an African American composer staged at the Metropolitan Opera. His musical style blends post-bop jazz with elements of Latin jazz, blues, and orchestral music, often addressing social issues through his work.

A seven-time Grammy Award winner and 2024 NEA Jazz Master, Blanchard is also a dedicated mentor and educator, having held leadership roles at the Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz, UCLA, and Berklee College of Music. His legacy is marked by his innovative contributions to jazz, film, and opera, as well as his commitment to nurturing the next generation of musicians.
