## Biography
Luciano Alves is a Brazilian pianist, keyboardist, composer and arranger known for his work in both classical and popular music, as well as his expertise in music technology.[2] Born in Brazil (he is frequently associated with Rio de Janeiro–based musicians), he began his professional musical activities around 1970, developing a career that bridges live performance, studio work, and educational projects.[2] Over the decades he has cultivated a reputation for technical refinement at the piano and a deep understanding of harmony and arrangement, which led him to be sought after as both a performer and a behind‑the‑scenes musical director.[2]

Alves’s catalog includes solo piano albums devoted to classical repertoire such as "Luciano Alves Plays Bach" and "Luciano Alves Plays Chopin," reflecting his strong grounding in the European classical tradition and his ability to interpret canonical works with clarity and nuance.[4] At the same time, he remains active in Brazilian and contemporary idioms, appearing on compilation projects like "The Ethnic Sampler, Vol. 6," which highlight his stylistic flexibility and comfort in ensemble settings.[4] Parallel to his performing career, Alves has become an authority in specialized data and computer technology applied to music, maintaining a website that offers resources on keyboard history, notation practices, chord symbols for notation software, and information on courses and workshops he conducts for musicians and music professionals.[2][5] This dual focus on artistry and technology has made him a respected figure among pianists, arrangers, and music technologists in Brazil and beyond.

Through his long career, Alves has contributed not only as a performer but also as an educator, giving courses and workshops that disseminate practical knowledge about keyboards, arranging, and digital tools used in music creation and publishing.[5] His work in these areas has supported many working musicians and students who rely on accurate chord notation, MIDI, and score‑preparation techniques, further solidifying his legacy as both a creative artist and a technical specialist.[2][5]
