## Quick Info
- **Genres**: reggae, roots reggae
- **Spotify Popularity**: 47/100
- **Followers**: 647,953
- **Origin**: São Luís, Maranhão, Brazil

## Biography
Tribo de Jah is a pioneering Brazilian **roots reggae** band formed in **São Luís, Maranhão**, in the mid‑1980s by a group of visually impaired musicians who met at the Maranhão School for the Blind.[1][4][5][7] At the boarding school they began experimenting with improvised instruments, discovering timbres and chords, and soon started playing popular dances around São Luís and other cities in Maranhão, performing seresta, reggae, and lambada covers.[1][4][5] The arrival of broadcaster and singer Fauzi Beydoun—born in São Paulo to Italian and Lebanese parents and deeply immersed in reggae culture after living four years in Ivory Coast—helped crystallize the project into a full‑fledged band in what was then an explosive reggae scene that earned São Luís the nickname **“Brazilian Jamaica.”**[1][3]

From these grassroots beginnings, Tribo de Jah developed an independent career built on socially conscious lyrics, Rastafarian spirituality, and a classic roots reggae sound sung in Portuguese and often referencing the everyday struggles of Brazil’s poor and marginalized.[1][5][8] Their music carried messages of love, peace, and “social and divine politics” that initially kept them off mainstream radio and television, but they persisted through self‑released albums and relentless touring across Brazil.[1][8] Over time, the band secured national distribution, played major Brazilian venues from Belém to Porto Alegre, and gained international exposure with performances at **Reggae Sunsplash 1995 in Jamaica** and shows in Argentina, French Guiana, France, Italy, and other countries, earning recognition as one of Brazil’s most important and enduring reggae bands.[1][5][6][8]

Rooted in the distinctive reggae culture of Maranhão—spread initially through powerful neighborhood sound systems rather than commercial radio—Tribo de Jah helped cement São Luís’s identity as a reggae capital and brought Brazilian‑Portuguese roots reggae to international stages.[1][3][6][8] Their legacy rests on giving voice to social issues through an unmistakably Jamaican‑inspired yet locally grounded style, and on proving that a band formed by blind musicians could become a national reference point for reggae and a symbol of resilience, independence, and cultural pride in Brazil.[1][5][7][8]

## Fun Facts
- Tribo de Jah was founded by **four blind musicians and a fifth member with partial vision in only one eye**, all of whom met while studying at the Maranhão School for the Blind.[1][4][5][7]
- The band emerged from the unique reggae subculture of **São Luís, Maranhão**, whose hundreds of reggae clubs and massive sound systems led the city to be known nationwide as **“Brazilian Jamaica.”**[1][3]
- Before releasing their own albums, the musicians built a following by playing popular dances around Maranhão, performing **seresta, reggae, and lambada cover songs** for local crowds.[1][4]
- Despite being largely ignored at first by major labels, radio, TV, and newspapers because of their strong social and spiritual messages, Tribo de Jah went on to play the prestigious **Reggae Sunsplash Festival in Jamaica in 1995**, a landmark achievement for a Brazilian reggae band.[1][5][6]
