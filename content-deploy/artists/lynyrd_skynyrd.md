## Biography
Lynyrd Skynyrd is an American rock band formed in Jacksonville, Florida, in 1964 by singer Ronnie Van Zant, guitarists Gary Rossington and Allen Collins, drummer Bob Burns, and bassist Larry Junstrom, initially under the name My Backyard.[2][4] After cycling through names like The Noble Five and The One Percent, they adopted the name Lynyrd Skynyrd in the late 1960s—a tongue‑in‑cheek reference to Leonard Skinner, a high school gym teacher known for enforcing rules against long hair.[2][3][4] By the early 1970s the band had expanded to include bassist Leon Wilkeson, keyboardist Billy Powell, and guitarist Ed King, and was honing a sound that fused blues, country, and hard rock, often powered by a distinctive three‑guitar attack.[1][3][4]

The group was discovered in 1972 by musician and producer Al Kooper, who signed them to his Sounds of the South label (distributed by MCA) and produced their debut album, *(Pronounced 'Lĕh-'nérd 'Skin-'nérd)*, released in 1973.[2][4] That record introduced signature songs such as “Free Bird” and “Simple Man,” establishing the band as a leading force in Southern rock.[2][3][4] Throughout the mid‑1970s, Lynyrd Skynyrd released a string of influential albums and anthems, including “Sweet Home Alabama,” while cultivating a gritty, working‑class image and an intense live reputation built around extended guitar jams and Ronnie Van Zant’s plainspoken storytelling lyrics.[3][4]

At the height of their success, tragedy struck on October 20, 1977, when the band’s chartered plane crashed en route to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, killing Ronnie Van Zant, guitarist Steve Gaines, backing vocalist Cassie Gaines, and others, and severely injuring surviving members.[2][3][4] The group disbanded in the wake of the accident, but in 1987 several surviving members reunited with Ronnie’s younger brother Johnny Van Zant as lead vocalist, launching the “Southern by the Grace of God” tribute tour and effectively restarting Lynyrd Skynyrd as a continuing band.[1][2][4] Despite numerous lineup changes over subsequent decades, the group has continued to tour and record, was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2006, and remains one of the defining acts of Southern rock, with songs like “Free Bird” and “Sweet Home Alabama” entrenched in the classic rock canon.[3][4]

## Fun Facts
- The band’s name “Lynyrd Skynyrd” is a playful misspelling of Leonard Skinner, a Jacksonville high‑school gym teacher known for enforcing a strict policy against boys having long hair.[2][3][4]
- Before settling on Lynyrd Skynyrd, the group performed under several names—including My Backyard, The Noble Five, and The One Percent—while playing local gigs around Jacksonville.[1][2][4]
- “Free Bird” began as a slow ballad and evolved into a signature live epic featuring extended guitar solos; it was written in part as a tribute to guitarist Duane Allman of the Allman Brothers Band.[3][5]
- After the 1977 plane crash, the group remained inactive for a decade; their 1987 reunion tour with Johnny Van Zant on vocals was originally conceived as a one‑time tribute but proved so successful that it relaunched Lynyrd Skynyrd as an ongoing band.[1][4]

### Key Collaborators
- [[ronnie_van_zant|Ronnie Van Zant]] - Founding lead vocalist and principal lyricist, central to the band’s identity and classic 1970s output. (All studio albums from *(Pronounced 'Lĕh-'nérd 'Skin-'nérd)* (1973) through *Street Survivors* (1977)) [1964–1977[2][4]]
- [[gary_rossington|Gary Rossington]] - Founding guitarist and long‑time core member; key architect of the band’s three‑guitar sound and slide guitar work.

- [[ed_king|Ed King]] - Guitarist and songwriter who completed the classic three‑guitar lineup; co‑wrote and played on “Sweet Home Alabama.” (*Second Helping*; “Sweet Home Alabama”; returned for the 1987 tribute/reunion tour) [Early 1970s; returned in late 1980s[1][2][4][5]]
- [[leon_wilkeson|Leon Wilkeson]] - Bassist whose melodic style anchored the rhythm section during the band’s peak years and after the reunion. (1970s studio albums including *Second Helping* and *Street Survivors*; post‑1987 touring and recordings) [Early 1970s–2001[2][4]]

### Artists Influenced
- [[southern_rock_and_country_rock_bands_e.g._.38_special|Southern rock and country rock bands (e.g., .38 Special)]] - Lynyrd Skynyrd’s sound and success helped define Southern rock and opened doors for later bands; .38 Special included Donnie Van Zant, Ronnie’s brother, and drew heavily on Skynyrd’s twin/three‑guitar and anthem style. (Arena‑oriented Southern rock of the late 1970s and 1980s that echoes Skynyrd’s riff‑driven, chorus‑heavy approach) [Late 1970s–1980s and beyond[3][4] (inferred from genre history)]
- [[country_and_countryrock_artists|Country and country‑rock artists]] - Skynyrd’s blend of country storytelling with rock instrumentation influenced later country and country‑rock performers who adopted similar lyrical themes and guitar tones. (Numerous country‑rock and modern country recordings that reference or sonically echo “Sweet Home Alabama” and “Free Bird”) [1980s–present[3][4] (inferred from Southern rock’s documented impact)]
- [[classic_rock_and_jamband_guitarists|Classic rock and jam‑band guitarists]] - The extended solo section of “Free Bird” and the band’s triple‑guitar format became touchstones for rock guitarists and live‑jam‑oriented bands. (Live versions and covers of “Free Bird”; adoption of long guitar codas and multiple‑guitar arrangements) [1970s–present[3][4] (inferred from the song’s canonical status)]
