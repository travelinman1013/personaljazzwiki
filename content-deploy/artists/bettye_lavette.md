## Biography
Bettye LaVette, born Betty Jo Haskins on January 29, 1946, in Muskegon, Michigan, is a celebrated American soul singer whose career spans more than six decades. Raised in Detroit, she was exposed to a vibrant mix of R&B, blues, and country music in her family home, which often hosted traveling musicians. Unlike many of her contemporaries, LaVette did not begin singing in church but instead honed her craft in her parents' living room, developing a distinctive style that would blend soul, blues, rock, funk, gospel, and country influences[1][2][7].

LaVette recorded her first single, "My Man – He’s a Lovin’ Man," at age sixteen with producer Johnnie Mae Matthews, and it quickly became a major R&B hit after being picked up by Atlantic Records. Despite early chart success and touring with prominent acts like Ben E. King and Otis Redding, her career was marked by periods of obscurity and label changes throughout the 1960s and 1970s. She released several singles and albums, including the acclaimed "Let Me Down Easy" and the unreleased "Child of the Seventies" recorded at Muscle Shoals. LaVette’s fortunes shifted dramatically in the 2000s with the release of "I've Got My Own Hell to Raise" (2005), which brought her widespread critical acclaim and established her as one of the premier soul interpreters of her generation[1][2][3].

Known for her emotionally charged, interpretive vocal style, LaVette has received multiple Grammy nominations, was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 2020, and honored with the Legacy of Americana Lifetime Achievement Award in 2023. Her ability to transform any song into a deeply personal statement has earned her the admiration of peers and critics alike, solidifying her legacy as a true icon of American music[2][3][4].
