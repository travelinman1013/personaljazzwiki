## Biography
Eric Krasno and Stanton Moore are two highly respected figures in the world of jazz, funk, and soul, each with decades of experience and a reputation for innovation and collaboration. Eric Krasno, a guitarist and producer, is best known as a founding member of the bands Lettuce and Soulive, groups that have been instrumental in shaping the modern funk and soul-jazz landscape. Stanton Moore, born in New Orleans in 1972, is a Grammy Award-winning drummer and a founding member of the influential funk band Galactic, as well as Garage-a-Trois. Moore has also built a prolific solo career and is recognized for his deep roots in New Orleans rhythm and his contributions to education in drumming.[1][2][3][5][7]

The two artists had crossed paths many times over their careers, sharing stages and musical circles but never collaborating on a formal project until the COVID-19 pandemic provided the space and impetus to do so. In 2022, they formed the Krasno Moore Project, bringing together their extensive experience and shared love of groove-based music. Their debut album, 'Book of Queens,' released on Concord Jazz, is a tribute to women in music, featuring soulful reinterpretations of songs by artists such as Amy Winehouse, Aretha Franklin, and Billie Eilish. The project also features Hammond organist Eric Finland, who cites both Krasno and Moore as major influences during his formative years.[1][4][6][7]

Krasno and Moore are celebrated for their versatility and commitment to musical excellence, blending elements of jazz, funk, rock, and soul. Their work together exemplifies a mutual respect for tradition and a drive to push boundaries, making the Krasno Moore Project a standout example of contemporary jazz-funk collaboration. Both artists continue to inspire new generations of musicians through their recordings, live performances, and educational outreach.[1][2][3][4]
