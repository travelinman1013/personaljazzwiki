## Biography
Justice, Tame Impala, and KAYTRANADA are three distinct electronic music artists who have collaborated on the Grammy-nominated track 'Neverender.' Justice is a French electronic duo consisting of Gaspard Augé and Xavier de Rosnay, who have been performing live since 2005 and are known for their electro-dance sound with hits like 'D.A.N.C.E' and 'Audio, Video, Disco.' KAYTRANADA, born Louis Kevin Celestin, is a Haitian-Canadian DJ, music producer, and rapper who has dominated the electronic music scene since 2013, earning a Grammy for Best Dance Recording in 2021 for his collaboration with Kali Uchis on '10%.' Tame Impala is the psychedelic music project of Kevin Parker, known for his innovative approach to electronic and psychedelic pop music. These three artists represent different eras and styles within electronic music—Justice rooted in the French touch movement of the 1990s, KAYTRANADA in contemporary dance and hip-hop production, and Tame Impala in psychedelic experimentation—yet they share a mutual appreciation and similar emotional sensibility that led to their groundbreaking collaboration.
