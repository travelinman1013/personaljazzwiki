## Biography
Harry Belafonte, born Harold George Bellanfanti Jr. on March 1, 1927, in Harlem, New York City, was the son of Jamaican immigrants and spent part of his childhood in Jamaica before returning to New York. Facing poverty and a turbulent family life, Belafonte joined the Navy during World War II and later began singing in New York clubs to pay for acting classes, where his early performances were backed by jazz legends such as Charlie Parker, Max Roach, and Miles Davis[1][6][9].

Belafonte's breakthrough came with the film 'Carmen Jones' in 1954, which propelled him into the spotlight. His 1956 album 'Calypso' became the first LP by a single artist to sell over one million copies in a year, introducing calypso and Caribbean folk music to international audiences and earning him the title 'King of Calypso.' While best known for hits like 'Day-O (The Banana Boat Song)' and 'Jamaica Farewell,' Belafonte recorded in a wide range of genres, including blues, folk, gospel, jazz, and American standards[1][2][3][4][5][8].

Beyond music, Belafonte was a prominent actor, producer, and civil rights activist, closely involved with Martin Luther King Jr. and instrumental in the Civil Rights Movement. He championed social causes worldwide, produced the Grammy-winning single 'We Are the World,' and was the first Black American man to receive an Emmy Award. Belafonte's legacy endures through his musical innovations, social activism, and influence on generations of artists[1][4][6].
