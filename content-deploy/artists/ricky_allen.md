## Biography
Richard A. Allen, known professionally as Ricky Allen, was an American blues and R&B singer born on January 6, 1935, in Nashville, Tennessee.[1][2] He began his musical journey singing gospel in his local church choir before relocating to Chicago in 1960, where he would establish himself as a prominent figure in the city's early 1960s blues scene.[1][2] Allen's recording breakthrough came in 1961 when he recorded "You'd Better Be Sure" for Mel London's Age Records label, which became a significant local hit in Chicago.[2] His most notable commercial success arrived in 1963 with "Cut You A-Loose," which peaked at number 20 on Billboard's R&B chart and number 126 on the pop chart, establishing him as one of Age Records' most prolific and successful artists.[1][2][3]

Allen's musical style exemplified the emerging soul-blues genre of the early 1960s, characterized by his fine soul-tinged vocals and contemporary sensibility applied to blues roots.[2][3] Throughout the 1960s, he recorded numerous songs that showcased this hybrid style, including "It's A Mess I Tell You" and "I Can't Stand No Signifying," which presaged the soul-blues movement that would gain prominence in the 1970s.[1] Despite his local success and prolific recording output across multiple Chicago labels including USA, 4Brothers, Bright Star, Apogee, and Tam-Boo, Allen struggled to achieve crossover appeal to the emerging white blues audience and found himself increasingly out of step with changing musical tastes.[2]

After disbanding his group in 1974, Allen retired from the music industry and transitioned to business ventures, operating a laundry service and later an A-1 Livery Service.[1][2] He experienced a remarkable late-career resurgence when Swedish blues magazine Jefferson rediscovered him in 2000, leading to his performance at the 2001 Mönsterås Blues Festival in Sweden—his first international performance outside North America.[2] He made additional appearances at the Chicago Blues Festival in 2002 before his health declined following a heart attack in December 2004.[2] Allen died on May 29, 2005, at age 70.[1][2]

## Fun Facts
- Allen turned down an offer from James Brown around 1957 to perform as a supporting act because Brown didn't pay well enough, a decision that reflected his early struggles to earn money from music.[2]
- Allen's recording breakthrough at Age Records came almost by accident—he accompanied drummer Bobby Little to a session with Earl Hooker, and when studio time remained after the scheduled session ended, he was given the opportunity to record "You'd Better Be Sure" and "You Were My Teacher," with the former becoming his first major hit.[2]
- Allen's 2001 performance at Sweden's Mönsterås Blues Festival marked his first time traveling outside the United States (except for some Canadian touring dates in the 1960s) and was reportedly the first time he performed outside of the Black community, where he received critical acclaim from the local press.[2]
- After retiring from music in the mid-1970s, Allen operated his own A-1 Livery Service in the 1990s and continued driving his own car as a limousine service operator until suffering a heart attack in December 2004, just months before his death.[2]
