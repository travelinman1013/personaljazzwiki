## Biography
JJ Grey & Mofro is a celebrated American band led by singer-songwriter JJ Grey, originating from Jacksonville, Florida. Grey’s musical journey began in the mid-1990s, collaborating with Daryl Hance in various local bands before forming Mofro Magic and briefly signing with a UK label. Returning to Florida, they adopted the name Mofro, a term Grey chose to evoke the Southern character of their sound. Their debut album, 'Blackwater' (2001), and its follow-up 'Lochloosa' (2004) drew heavily on Grey’s upbringing and the natural landscapes of northern Florida, blending blues, soul, rock, and funk into a distinctive style[3][1][4].

The band’s profile grew with a move to Alligator Records in 2007, releasing a string of acclaimed albums including 'Country Ghetto,' 'Orange Blossoms,' and 'Georgia Warhorse.' Their music is marked by deeply evocative lyrics, Southern storytelling, and a fusion of genres that has earned them a devoted following. JJ Grey’s soulful vocals and the band’s big instrumentation—featuring guitars, keyboards, harmonica, and horns—have made them staples at major festivals worldwide, including Lollapalooza, Bonnaroo, and Austin City Limits[1][5].

JJ Grey & Mofro’s legacy lies in their ability to channel the spirit of the American South, addressing themes of environmental change, personal struggle, and resilience. Their influence extends beyond genre boundaries, and they continue to tour extensively, captivating audiences with their energetic performances and authentic sound[1][3][5].
