## Biography
Buddy & Julie Miller are a celebrated American husband-and-wife duo whose work has defined and expanded the boundaries of Americana and alt-country music. Buddy Miller, born in 1952, and Julie Miller, both originally from Texas, met in Austin in the mid-1970s and quickly formed both a personal and musical partnership. After stints in Los Angeles and New York, they settled in Nashville, where their creative synergy flourished. Julie initially found success as a songwriter and solo artist in the Christian music scene, while Buddy established himself as a highly respected guitarist, producer, and solo artist, collaborating with a wide array of musicians across genres.[2][1][7]

Their first official album as a duo, 'Buddy & Julie Miller' (2001), won the Americana Music Association’s Album of the Year award, cementing their status as leading figures in roots music. Their subsequent albums, including 'Written in Chalk' (2009), 'Breakdown on 20th Avenue South' (2019), and 'In the Throes' (2023), showcase a distinctive blend of mournful gospel, dusty country, cosmic blues, and R&B. Their music is marked by Julie’s emotionally direct songwriting and Buddy’s inventive guitar work, often characterized by his signature tremolo sound. Together, they have received numerous accolades, including a Grammy Award and multiple Americana Music Association Awards, and their songs have been recorded by artists such as Linda Ronstadt, Levon Helm, Emmylou Harris, and Diana Krall.[2][1]

Beyond their own recordings, Buddy & Julie Miller are known for their deep connections within the Americana community. Buddy has produced and performed with legends like Robert Plant and Solomon Burke, while Julie’s songwriting has been covered by a diverse roster of artists. Their enduring partnership, both on and off stage, is widely regarded as a model of creative collaboration and mutual inspiration, making them influential figures in contemporary American roots music.[2][1][4]
