## Biography
Daniela Bojorges-Giraldo, known professionally as St. Panther, was born in Irvine, California, to Mexican and Colombian parents who were both painters. From a young age, art permeated her life; at three years old, she began sounding out notes on her father's piano to Disney soundtracks, later taking guitar and drum lessons while playing clarinet and cello in high school drum line. Her early musical influences included Sade, Amy Winehouse, Lauryn Hill, Common, Nas, Wu-Tang Clan, Adrian Younge, and Ghostface Killah, blending soul, R&B, jazz, hip-hop, and alt-pop. Self-taught in production via YouTube tutorials on GarageBand and Logic, she started recording friends for $50 a session post-high school, progressing to produce Makeout Reef’s full-length LP Existential and fronting the band Quiet Girl.[1][2][5]

St. Panther formally debuted under her moniker—derived from her childhood nickname 'Little Panther' given by her father during middle school bullying—in 2015 with the independent P(1) EP, performing extensively at bars and art galleries. A pivotal skate shop performance led to management with Alternate Side and tours with nothing,nowhere, Wicca Phase Springs Eternal, and smrtdeath in 2019. She signed to Ricky Reed’s Nice Life Recording Company and Nate Mercereau’s How So Records, releasing her acclaimed debut EP These Days in 2020, featuring tracks like “Infrastructure” (premiered on HBO’s Insecure Season 4), “Playa,” “Highway,” and “These Days.” Her music, described as a hypnotic hybrid of soul swagger, jazz eloquence, and hip-hop heat, earned praise as a “lightning-bolt talent” from the LA Times and “Best New Artist” from KCRW, with rotations on BBC Radio 1 and features on Pharrell’s OTHERtone.[1][2][3][4][5]

Now based in East Los Angeles, St. Panther continues as a singer, rapper, producer, and multi-instrumentalist in alternative R&B, with TV placements on HBO’s Ballers and Genera+ion, and collaborations including Ricky Reed’s “Real Magic” with Terrace Martin. Her work amplifies raw emotions, offering journeys through personal ups and downs while gaining traction via Adidas Sound Labs events with Pusha T at ComplexCon.[3][4][5]
