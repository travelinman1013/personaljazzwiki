## Biography
Eddie Hazel (April 10, 1950 – December 23, 1992) was an American guitarist and singer best known for his pioneering work with Parliament-Funkadelic, where his expressive, psychedelic-infused guitar style helped define the sound of funk rock and psychedelic rock. Born in Brooklyn, New York, Hazel moved to Plainfield, New Jersey, as a child, where he sang in church and began playing guitar at an early age. By his early teens, he had formed a musical partnership with bassist Billy 'Bass' Nelson, and together they became central figures in the burgeoning funk scene.

Hazel's career took off when he joined George Clinton's backing band for The Parliaments, which soon evolved into Funkadelic. His innovative guitar work was a driving force on the group's early albums, particularly on the iconic ten-minute solo in 'Maggot Brain' (1971), widely regarded as one of the greatest guitar solos ever recorded. Hazel's style blended elements of rock, soul, and funk, marked by emotive phrasing and a distinctive use of distortion and effects. Despite personal and financial struggles that led to intermittent participation in the band, Hazel continued to contribute to Parliament-Funkadelic's evolving sound, co-writing and arranging key tracks and releasing his own solo album, 'Game, Dames and Guitar Thangs' in 1977.

Though Hazel died at the age of 42 from liver failure and internal bleeding, his legacy endures. He was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with Parliament-Funkadelic in 1997, and his influence can be heard in generations of guitarists across genres. His work, especially 'Maggot Brain', remains a touchstone for musicians seeking to blend technical mastery with deep emotional expression.
