## Biography
Paul Blake, professionally known as Frankie Paul, was born on October 19, 1965, in Kingston, Jamaica, and became one of the most prolific and influential dancehall reggae artists in Jamaican history. Born blind, he had his sight partially restored through an operation performed on a hospital ship during his childhood, and later obtained high-powered glasses to further improve his vision. He attended the Salvation Army School for the Blind, where he learned to play multiple instruments including piano, drums, and guitar, and where his musical talents first flourished. His early encounter with American superstar Stevie Wonder in 1975, who visited the school and encouraged him to pursue music, proved to be a pivotal moment in his career trajectory.

Frankie Paul emerged as a leading figure in the dancehall movement during the 1980s, recording his first single "African Princess" in 1980 at just 15 years old. His breakthrough came with "Worries in the Dance" in 1983, produced by Henry "Junjo" Lawes, which established him as a major force in the emerging dancehall sound. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, he became extraordinarily prolific, recording for virtually every major producer and studio in Jamaica and releasing over 30 albums alongside hundreds of singles. His musical style blended reggae, R&B, and soul, creating a distinctive sound characterized by his recognized vocal prowess. Notable hits included "Sara," "Cassanova," "Tidal Wave," "Alesha," and "Pass the Tu-Sheng-Peng," many of which achieved worldwide recognition.

Frankie Paul's legacy extends far beyond his commercial success; he was dubbed "The Jamaican Stevie Wonder" not only for his visual impairment but for his exceptional musical talents and versatility as a multi-instrumentalist. Over his three-decade career, he is estimated to have written and performed more than 5,000 songs. Despite facing significant health challenges later in life, including kidney problems that required dialysis and amputation, he remained active on the reggae scene into the 2000s. He received the Order of Distinction from the Jamaican government in 2004 for his contributions to Jamaican culture. Frankie Paul passed away on May 18, 2017, at age 51 in Kingston, Jamaica, and was buried with state honors at the National Heroes Park. His music continues to be celebrated by reggae fans worldwide, cementing his status as one of the greatest voices and talents in reggae music history.
