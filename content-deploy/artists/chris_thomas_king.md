## Biography
Chris Thomas King (born Durwood Christopher Thomas on October 14, 1962) is an American blues guitarist, singer, songwriter, producer, and actor, based in New Orleans, Louisiana.[1][4] Raised in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, he is the son of renowned blues musician Rockin’ Tabby Thomas, who owned the influential club Tabby’s Blues Box and Heritage Hall.[1][2][8] Immersed from childhood in the local blues scene, King grew up surrounded by working blues musicians at his father’s club and began touring in his teens with major artists such as Buddy Guy and B.B. King.[2][3][9] Discovered in Louisiana in 1979 by a folklorist from the Smithsonian Institution, he was introduced internationally by Arhoolie Records as a major new folk-blues artist, positioned as an authentic successor to figures like Huddie Ledbetter, Muddy Waters, Robert Johnson, and Jelly Roll Morton.[5]

In the late 1980s and 1990s, King began to move beyond traditional acoustic blues, becoming a pioneer of rap/blues fusion and modern, sample‑based blues.[1][5] He wrote and produced the first all rap/blues concept album for RCA Records, “21st Century Blues… from da Hood,” and subsequently coined and trademarked the term “21st Century Blues” in 1993.[1][2][3] As an entrepreneur, he took control of his master recordings, founded the New Orleans‑based label 21st Century Blues Records, the 21st Century Blues Studio, and the publishing company Young Blues Rebel, LLC, using these ventures to shape a contemporary image and sound for blues in the digital era.[1][2][4][5] His catalog spans traditional folk-blues, country blues, and modern blues infused with early hip‑hop and country influences, and he is noted for often writing, arranging, singing, and playing most instruments on his own recordings.[3][4][5]

King achieved major mainstream visibility as both musician and actor through film. He played Delta bluesman Tommy Johnson in the Coen brothers’ “O Brother, Where Art Thou?” (2000), appearing on-screen and contributing performances such as “Hard Time Killing Floor Blues” to the film’s multi‑platinum, Grammy‑winning soundtrack.[1][2][5] He later portrayed bandleader Lowell Fulson in the Ray Charles biopic “Ray” (2004) and appeared in projects such as Wim Wenders’ “The Soul of a Man” (as Blind Willie Johnson), “Down from the Mountain,” and other music‑centered films and documentaries.[1][2][5] Having sold more than ten million records in the United States, King is frequently described as one of the most commercially successful and stylistically innovative blues artists of his generation, with Grammy Awards including Album of the Year for the “O Brother, Where Art Thou?” soundtrack and a Country Music Association Album of the Year award, alongside multiple additional Grammy nominations.[1][2][4][5] In the 2010s and 2020s he continued to record and tour, releasing albums such as “Hotel Voodoo” (2017), “ANGOLA” (2020), and “Big Grey Sky” (2023), while also publishing work as an author and founding the Blues Origin Institute to advocate for a fuller, historically grounded understanding of blues music.[1][4][5]
