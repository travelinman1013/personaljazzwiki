## Biography
The Donays were a short‑lived early‑1960s R&B/ girl‑group from Hamtramck, Michigan, a small city within metropolitan Detroit.[1][6] Formed by school friends, the original five‑member lineup comprised Janice Guinn, her sister Armie Guinn, Yvonne Symington (later known as Yvonne Singleton/Yvonne Vernee), Michelle Ray, and a fifth member remembered only as Mary.[2][3] They were discovered at a high‑school talent show at Hamtramck High and taken to Correc‑tone Records, a small Detroit label active in the burgeoning local soul and R&B scene.[2][3] At Correc‑tone they were given two songs by songwriter Richard P. (Ricky) Drapkin, cutting “Devil in His Heart” and “Bad Boy” in sessions generally believed to have involved members of Motown’s famed Funk Brothers band, with production often attributed to Richard “Popcorn” Wylie in Detroit.[1][3]

“Devil in His Heart” was first issued around 1961–62 on Correc‑tone, then picked up in August 1962 by New York label Brent as the B‑side to “Bad Boy.”[1][2] Although the single failed to chart in the United States and the group soon disbanded, the record found an unlikely second life in Britain when Oriole Records licensed it and a copy ended up in Brian Epstein’s NEMS record shop in Liverpool.[2][3] There it was discovered by The Beatles, who re‑worked it as “Devil in Her Heart,” sung by George Harrison and released on their 1963 album “With The Beatles,” effectively canonizing the obscure track and giving The Donays a posthumous place in rock history.[1][2][3] After the group dissolved, lead singer Yvonne Symington/Singleton continued at Correc‑tone under the name Yvonne Vernee, cutting several solo singles, and later joined Motown group The Elgins in 1971 for a UK reunion tour during their brief resurgence.[1][2][3] Though The Donays recorded only this lone single, their blend of early‑’60s R&B and girl‑group pop—stylistically reminiscent of Motown acts and The Shirelles—has been retrospectively recognized as a notable example of the era and a key footnote in the transatlantic dialogue between Detroit soul and British pop.[1][2][3][6][7]

## Fun Facts
- The Donays recorded only one known single—“Devil in His Heart” backed with “Bad Boy”—yet that single indirectly reached millions of listeners via The Beatles’ cover.[1][2][3][7]
- The group started as five high‑school friends discovered at a talent show at Hamtramck High before ever entering a professional studio.[2][3]
- Although released as the B‑side to “Bad Boy,” it was the supposed throwaway track “Devil in His Heart” that captured The Beatles’ attention and became the song’s enduring legacy.[1][2][3]
- Lead singer Yvonne Vernee later joined Motown act The Elgins for their early‑1970s UK revival, giving her a second career phase long after The Donays had split.[1][2][3]
