## Biography
Abdul Rahman Hajaj, known professionally as Hajaj, is a Saudi Arabian singer-songwriter and producer whose journey has taken him from Jeddah to cities across Europe and the United States, eventually settling between London and his hometown. Growing up in a conservative Saudi society where artistic expression was heavily regulated, Hajaj found solace in music and Arabic poetry from a young age, nurtured by a family that celebrated arts and culture. His early exposure to a diverse musical palette—from Arabic legends like Feiruz and Talal Maddah to global icons such as Paco De Lucia and Pharrell—shaped his eclectic taste and creative ambitions.

Hajaj's career began to crystallize during his years abroad, particularly in London, where he met producer and multi-instrumentalist Aidan Glover. Together, they crafted his debut EP, 'Last Call For Coco' (2021), recorded on tape at Talbot Studios with a roster of London's top jazz musicians. The project, praised for its homage to the late 60s and early 70s soul era, explores themes of identity, longing, and the search for belonging, resonating with listeners through its rich melodies and introspective lyrics. Hajaj's sound blends retro soul, funk, Motown, and contemporary R&B, drawing inspiration from legends like Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder while incorporating Middle Eastern elements for a distinctive, genre-blurring style.

Now recognized as a significant figure in contemporary soul and R&B, Hajaj continues to push boundaries with projects like the EP 'In the Meantime' and his forthcoming album 'Meso.' His work is celebrated for its emotional depth, authenticity, and advocacy for individuality, positioning him as a bridge between cultures and a rising voice in global soul music.
