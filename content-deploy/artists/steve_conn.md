## Biography
Steve Conn is a Louisiana-born singer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist whose music is deeply rooted in the storytelling traditions of the American South. Born and raised in Pineville, Louisiana, Conn grew up in a household filled with music—his father was a well-known jazz violinist and bandleader, and his mother’s large, musical family provided a lively, creative environment[1]. He studied literature at Louisiana State University, a background that informs the narrative depth and keen observation in his lyrics[1][5]. After playing small clubs throughout Louisiana, Conn moved to Colorado in the 1970s, where he became a fixture in the local music scene, notably as the frontman of the New Orleans-inspired funk band Gris Gris, which quickly gained a following for its energetic, genre-blending performances[2][4].

Conn’s career has been marked by both regional acclaim and national recognition. He has lived and worked in Colorado, Los Angeles, and Nashville, serving as musical director for the NPR show eTown and performing with a wide array of artists across blues, pop, and roots music[1][2][4]. His solo albums, such as River of Madness (1994), Steve Conn (2003), Beautiful Dream (2011), and Flesh and Bone (2019), showcase his ability to blend Louisiana influences with pop sensibilities, creating music that is both emotionally resonant and rhythmically compelling[3][5]. Conn’s songwriting often explores themes of love, loss, and existential questioning, reflecting a lifelong engagement with the complexities of the human experience[1][3]. Despite his versatility and collaborations with major stars, Conn has maintained a distinctive voice as a songwriter and performer, carving out a niche that defies easy categorization[4][5].
