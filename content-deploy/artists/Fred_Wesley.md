## Biography
Fred Wesley, born in 1943 in Columbus, Georgia and raised in Mobile, Alabama, is a seminal American trombonist whose career has spanned over five decades and helped define the sound of funk and jazz-funk. The son of a high school teacher and big band leader, Wesley began his musical journey early, playing in his father's band at age 14 and participating in school and college marching bands before serving in a U.S. Army band. After his military service, he played with jazz groups and briefly joined the Ike and Tina Turner Revue before a pivotal moment in 1968, when he was invited to join James Brown's band. This collaboration marked the beginning of Wesley's rise as a key architect of the funk genre.

Wesley became a central figure in James Brown's bands throughout the 1960s and 1970s, contributing signature trombone riffs and serving as bandleader and musical director for the J.B.'s. He co-wrote and arranged numerous hits, including "Hot Pants," and played on classics like "Say it Loud – I'm Black and I'm Proud" and "Mother Popcorn." After leaving Brown's band in 1975, Wesley joined George Clinton's Parliament-Funkadelic collective, leading the Horny Horns and further cementing his reputation as a funk innovator. In 1978, he fulfilled a lifelong dream by joining the Count Basie Orchestra, and later released several jazz albums as a leader, blending his funk roots with jazz sophistication. Wesley has also led his own groups, such as Fred Wesley and the New JBs, and has remained active as a performer, arranger, and educator, influencing generations of musicians with his unique blend of jazz and funk.
