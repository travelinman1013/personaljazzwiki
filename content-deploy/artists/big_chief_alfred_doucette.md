## Biography
Big Chief Alfred Doucette was born on October 27, 1940, in New Orleans, Louisiana, and is recognized as the oldest living Mardi Gras Indian Chief born and raised in the city. As a Mardi Gras Indian, Doucette carries forward a cultural tradition over 150 years old that honors Native American roots in Louisiana and commemorates the tribes who sheltered escaping African slaves. The tradition emerged through the integration of cultures during Mardi Gras celebrations, with practitioners becoming known as "Black Masking Indians." Doucette is a charismatic performer with a strong and quirky tenor voice characterized by a tart, stinging tonality that distinguishes his musical presence.

Beyond his role as a cultural icon, Doucette is a multifaceted entrepreneur and musician. He owned the legendary Nite Cap nightclub in New Orleans during the 1970s, which became a hub for R&B touring acts and local greats including the Neville Brothers and Marvin Gaye. The Nite Cap operated with remarkable success, regularly drawing crowds of over a thousand people nightly. Doucette began his singing career later in life, hitting his stride at age 70, and has since become a fixture on Frenchmen Street and other New Orleans music venues. Since 2005, he has performed regularly with vocalist Lani Ramos (known as Big Pearl), creating a dynamic musical partnership that blends New Orleans classics, R&B standards, and original compositions.

Doucette's artistic legacy extends beyond performance into activism and education. As chief of the Flaming Arrows Mardi Gras Indian gang, he meticulously sews his own Mardi Gras Indian suits, with each design incorporating distinctive and often controversial messages reflecting his commitment to human rights activism. At over 80 years old, he continues to hand-sew every bead himself and teaches children and adult friends his sewing techniques, using his Indian suits as a canvas for cultural transmission. His contributions to New Orleans music and culture have established him as a living legend and treasure of the city.
