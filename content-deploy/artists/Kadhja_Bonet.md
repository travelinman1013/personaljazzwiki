## Biography
Kadhja Bonet is a Los Angeles-based multi-instrumentalist, singer, songwriter, and producer known for her genre-defying sound that blends elements of soul, jazz, neo-classical, and vintage pop. Born to a musical family, Bonet began her musical journey at the age of five, studying classical violin—a discipline that laid the foundation for her intricate arrangements and lush orchestrations later in her career[6]. Her early exposure to classical music, combined with her voracious curiosity, led her to master several instruments, including flute, guitar, and viola, and to develop a distinctive voice both as a performer and composer[1][2][4].

Bonet's debut project, 'The Visitor' EP, released independently in 2015, showcased her ability to weave cinematic soundscapes with soulful melodies and poetic lyricism[1][2]. She wrote, arranged, and produced the record herself, performing much of the instrumentation and collaborating with Grammy-nominated engineer Itai Shapira for additional production[1][2]. Her follow-up album, 'Childqueen,' released on Fat Possum Records in 2018, further established her as a singular voice in contemporary music, blending neo-soul vocals with jazz-inflected instrumentation and psychedelic textures[3]. Despite her growing acclaim, Bonet has often spoken about the challenges of self-managing her career and the pressures of delivering her complex studio sound in live settings[3].

Bonet's music is celebrated for its timeless quality, often described as existing outside conventional eras or genres. Critics have noted her "era-blurring, soul-smothered compositions" and her commitment to artistic independence, with Bonet herself emphasizing the importance of breaking down personal and societal barriers through her work[1][2]. Her legacy is that of an artist who refuses to be confined by genre or expectation, continually pushing the boundaries of modern soul and jazz while inspiring listeners and fellow musicians alike.
