## Biography
Theo Croker and Sullivan Fortner represent a dynamic musical partnership rooted in nearly two decades of friendship, collaboration, and shared artistic vision. Theo Croker (born July 18, 1985, in Leesburg, Florida) is a Grammy-nominated trumpeter, composer, and producer who draws inspiration from his grandfather, Grammy-winning jazz legend Doc Cheatham. After studying under Donald Byrd and Gary Bartz at Oberlin Conservatory, Croker spent seven years in Shanghai (2006-2013) as the first artist-in-residence at the Peace Hotel Jazz Club, where he broadened his musical palette to encompass jazz, neo-soul, salsa, fusion-rock, R&B, hip-hop, and blues. Sullivan Fortner (born December 29, 1986, in New Orleans) is a Grammy Award-winning pianist and composer who began playing at age 7, following the storied lineage of New Orleans improvisers. He earned his Bachelor of Music from Oberlin Conservatory and Master of Music in Jazz Performance from Manhattan School of Music, later serving as a faculty member and visiting professor at Oberlin.

The Croker-Fortner collaboration spans multiple studio projects and live performances, beginning with Croker's early albums and continuing through major label releases. Their partnership is characterized by mutual respect and complementary musical sensibilities—Croker's expansive trumpet voice paired with Fortner's harmonic sophistication and rhythmic clarity. Fortner has appeared on Croker's albums including *The Fundamentals* (2007), *Afro Physicist* (2014, produced by Dee Dee Bridgewater), and *In The Tradition* (Arbors Records), as well as the collaborative project *Play*. Beyond their direct work together, both artists have established themselves as sought-after collaborators and educators, with Fortner earning international acclaim for his work with vocalist Cecile McLorin Salvant and Croker collaborating with artists including Jill Scott, Ari Lennox, J. Cole, and Common.
