## Biography
The Georgia Cotton Pickers were a short-lived but influential country blues group active in Atlanta, Georgia, around 1930. The group consisted of three prominent blues musicians: Curley Weaver, Barbecue Bob (Robert Hicks), and Buddy Moss. Each member brought a distinct musical background shaped by the rich blues traditions of rural Georgia. Weaver, born in Covington, Georgia, was taught guitar by his mother and played with Barbecue Bob and Charlie Hicks from a young age. Buddy Moss, originally a harmonica player from Jewell, Georgia, joined the group after moving to Atlanta and busking with local musicians.

The Georgia Cotton Pickers made their recorded debut in 1930 at the Campbell Hotel in Atlanta, capturing the vibrant house party blues scene of the era. Although they only recorded four songs as a group, their collaboration showcased a blend of Piedmont blues and rural country blues styles, marked by intricate guitar interplay and expressive vocals. The group’s brief existence was cut short by the untimely death of Barbecue Bob in 1931, after which the members continued their careers individually, often collaborating with other notable blues artists.

Musically, the Georgia Cotton Pickers were known for their energetic performances and innovative guitar techniques, which helped define the Atlanta blues sound. Their recordings are considered prototypes of blues 'super groups,' and their legacy endures through the continued influence of their members on subsequent generations of blues musicians. The group’s work is recognized as a foundational moment in the development of country blues, particularly in the southeastern United States.

## Fun Facts
