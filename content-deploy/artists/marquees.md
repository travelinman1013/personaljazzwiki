## Biography
MARQUEE, born Markita Ferguson in Queens, New York, developed her passion for music through her mother Dolores, who introduced her to records, encouraged sampling, and supported her pursuits. Influenced by hip hop legends like Queen Latifah, Nas, and Jay-Z, as well as R&B and rock elements, she honed a unique style blending hip hop melodies, underground wordplay, and rock influences. A dominant lyricist known as an 'emcee's emcee,' she gained respect from hip hop icons and R&B artists for her hooks and poetic content.[1]

In the early 2000s, MARQUEE formed the group Femme Fatale, generating street buzz under D.I.T.C. that sparked a label bidding war, culminating in a major deal with Trackmasters under Sony. After the group, she released her solo project MARQUEE Femme Fatale as songwriter, publisher, and executive producer. She collaborated with Pharrell Williams and Kelis on tracks like 'Mafia' from Kelis's Kaleidoscope and The Shield soundtrack, and 'Wild Cowboys.' Touring with hip hop staples and featured in Billboard Magazine, she founded Block Share Inc LLC in 2015 as CEO, continuing to work across genres while aspiring to cultivate talent and win a Grammy.[1]

Remaining low-key yet prolific, MARQUEE's career spans major label signings, extensive collaborations, and independent ventures, establishing her as a versatile New York native with enduring roots in hip hop and R&B.
