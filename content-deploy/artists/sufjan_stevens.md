## Biography
Sufjan Stevens, born July 1, 1975, in Detroit, Michigan, and raised in Petoskey and Holland, Michigan, began his musical career in the mid-1990s as a member of the folk-rock band Marzuki and garage band Con Los Dudes from Holland, Michigan, while also contributing instruments to Danielson Famile. During his final semester at Hope College, he recorded his debut solo album *A Sun Came*, released in 2000 on Asthmatic Kitty Records, which he co-founded with his stepfather Lowell Brams. After moving to New York City for a writing program at The New School for Social Research, Stevens explored electronica with *Enjoy Your Rabbit* (2001) and launched his ambitious Fifty States Project, starting with *Michigan* (2003), followed by the critically acclaimed *Illinois* (2005), known for its baroque pop style blending indie folk, orchestral elements, and influences from Vince Guaraldi, Steve Reich, and Philip Glass.[1][2][3]

Stevens gained widespread recognition with *Illinois*, which topped the Billboard Top Heatseekers chart and earned him the 2005 Pantheon prize, alongside releases like *Seven Swans* (2004), *The Avalanche* (2006), and *Songs for Christmas* (2006). His career evolved through experimental works such as *The Age of Adz* (2010), collaborations including *Aporia* (2020) with Lowell Brams, and introspective albums like *Carrie & Lowell* (2015) and *Javelin* (2023), featuring contributors like Bryce Dessner of The National. His lyrically rich songs often explore themes of faith, family, and personal grief, earning Grammy and Academy Award nominations, including for 'Mystery of Love' from the *Call Me by Your Name* soundtrack (2017).[2][3]

Stevens' legacy lies in his genre-defying approach, from folk revival and indie pop to electronic and minimalist compositions, influencing indie music with his conceptual ambition and multi-instrumental prowess, while maintaining a private persona focused on artistic depth over commercial success.[1][2]

## Fun Facts

- He worked in the children's book division at Time Warner until touring for *Seven Swans* in 2004, balancing music with a day job.
- Annual Christmas recordings from 2001 (except 2004) were compiled into the five-CD box set *Songs for Christmas* (2006), initially made to help him 'appreciate' the holiday.
- In 2006, he debuted a ten-minute-plus composition 'Majesty Snowbird' live in Nashville, previewing his evolving experimental style.
