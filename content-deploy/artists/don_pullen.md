## Biography
Don Gabriel Pullen was born on December 25, 1941, in Roanoke, Virginia, and grew up in a musical family that profoundly shaped his artistic trajectory. He began piano lessons at age 10 with a neighbor and was heavily influenced by his cousin, professional jazz pianist Clyde "Fats" Wright, as well as his church's gospel music tradition. Though he initially pursued medical studies at Johnson C. Smith University in North Carolina, Pullen soon realized that music was his true vocation. After exposure to recordings of major jazz musicians and composers like Ornette Coleman and Eric Dolphy, he abandoned his medical career and moved to Chicago in 1964, where he encountered Muhal Richard Abrams' philosophy of creative music before relocating to New York.

In New York, Pullen immersed himself in the avant-garde jazz scene of the 1960s, making his recording debut in 1964 with saxophonist Giuseppi Logan on ESP Records. He developed a strikingly individual extended piano technique that allowed him to execute extremely fast runs while maintaining melodic clarity, combining post-bop modernism with a strong blues sensibility. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Pullen recorded free duets with drummer Milford Graves, worked with Nina Simone (1970-1971), and briefly joined Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers (1974). His most prominent ensemble role came as pianist with Charles Mingus' final great group (1973-1975), appearing on the landmark albums *Changes One* and *Changes Two*.

Following Mingus' death, Pullen co-led a notable quartet with tenor saxophonist George Adams from 1979-1988, recording two albums for Blue Note Records and achieving greater commercial visibility. In his later years, he led the African-Brazilian Connection, releasing Blue Note albums including *Kele Mou Bana* (1990) and *Ode to Life* (1993), while continuing to collaborate with artists across multiple genres. His final project, *Sacred Common Ground* (1994), represented his lifelong quest to fuse jazz with traditional Native American music. Pullen's legacy encompasses his role as an inspired keyboard artist, unforgettable improviser, prolific composer, and daring bandleader who crossed and mixed genres decades before it became commonplace.

## Fun Facts
- Pullen's birth year was often incorrectly listed as 1944, but he was actually born on Christmas Day, December 25, 1941, in Roanoke, Virginia.
- He developed an unorthodox and highly individual piano technique that allowed him to execute extremely fast runs while maintaining the melodic line, a skill he cultivated through dedicated practice and innovation rather than traditional classical training.
- Pullen explained his lifelong affinity for Latin and African music by noting that his very first composition as a child was a samba, and he believed that blues, jazz, Brazilian music, and flamenco all shared African roots, which allowed musicians from different traditions to play together seamlessly.
- Despite his prominence in the avant-garde and free jazz scenes, Pullen maintained accessibility in his music by combining free harmonic exploration with catchy rhythms, giving listeners 'a handle to hang on to' even in his freest improvisations.
