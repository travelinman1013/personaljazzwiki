## Biography
Blind Lemon Jefferson, born Lemon Henry Jefferson in September 1893 near Couchman, Texas, was the youngest of seven children in a family of African-American sharecroppers. Blind from birth, Jefferson began playing guitar in his early teens, drawing from the vibrant musical traditions of the rural South, including blues, spirituals, and dance tunes. By 1912, he was performing regularly in Dallas, Texas, where his distinctive high-pitched voice and intricate guitar technique quickly set him apart from his contemporaries.

Jefferson's career took a significant turn in the mid-1920s when he was discovered by a Paramount Records scout and brought to Chicago to record. Between 1926 and 1929, he recorded nearly 100 songs, becoming one of the first solo blues singer-guitarists to achieve national commercial success. His innovative guitar style, characterized by melodic lead lines, bent notes, and unique phrasing, helped define the Texas blues sound. Jefferson's songwriting was equally influential, with classics like "See That My Grave Is Kept Clean," "Matchbox Blues," and "Black Snake Moan" becoming standards in the blues repertoire.

Despite his commercial success, Jefferson's life ended abruptly and mysteriously in December 1929 in Chicago. He was buried in Wortham, Texas, and his grave remained unmarked for decades. Jefferson's legacy endures as a foundational figure in blues history, influencing generations of musicians and earning him the title "Father of the Texas Blues." His recordings have been continually reissued, and he was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1980.
