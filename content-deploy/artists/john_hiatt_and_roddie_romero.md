## Biography
John Hiatt & Roddie Romero is a collaborative pairing between acclaimed American singer-songwriter John Hiatt and Louisiana-based guitarist and vocalist Roddie Romero. Their partnership is most notably featured on the 2025 tribute album 'A Tribute to the King of Zydeco,' honoring the legendary Clifton Chenier.
