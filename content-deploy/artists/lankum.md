- **Origin**: Dublin

## Biography
Lankum is a contemporary Irish folk music group from Dublin that evolved from the experimental punk-folk duo Lynched, formed by brothers Ian and Daragh Lynch in the early 2000s. Originally performing as an "experimental-psychedelic-folk-punk-duo," the Lynch brothers released their debut album *Where Did We Go Wrong?* in 2003 on the independent label Psalm O'The Vine, which unexpectedly achieved international success and led to tours across Europe, Mexico, and America. After returning to Ireland and developing a deeper interest in Dublin's traditional music sessions, the brothers were joined by vocalist and multi-instrumentalist Radie Peat and violinist Cormac MacDiarmada around 2012, transforming into the four-piece ensemble that records and performs today.

As Lankum, the band has achieved significant critical acclaim by synthesizing traditional Irish folk music with elements of drone, sludge, metal, and ambient music. Their discography includes *Cold Old Fire* (2014), *Between the Earth and Sky* (2017), *The Livelong Day* (2019), and *False Lankum* (2023), the latter of which garnered widespread critical recognition, Mercury Prize nomination, and numerous end-of-year accolades. The band's distinctive sound features four-part vocal harmonies combined with arrangements of uilleann pipes, concertina, Russian accordion, fiddle, and guitar, drawing from Dublin music-hall ditties, Traveller tradition ballads, traditional Irish and American dance tunes, and original compositions. In 2018, they were named Best Folk Group at the RTÉ Folk Music Awards, and they have won the RTÉ Choice Music Prize Irish Album of the Year twice—in 2019 for *The Livelong Day* and in 2024 for *False Lankum*.

Lankum's artistic journey reflects their evolution from anti-authoritarian punk musicians to sophisticated interpreters of Irish traditional music, reimagined through a contemporary experimental lens. Their work challenges conventional boundaries of folk music by incorporating heavy, atmospheric production and unconventional arrangements while maintaining deep roots in Irish cultural traditions. The band's name change from Lynched to Lankum occurred after meeting producer John 'Spud' Murphy, as the members recognized that the former name's connotations were too specific to a "radical left-wing punk audience" and limited their international appeal. Today, Lankum represents a vital contemporary voice in Irish music, bridging traditional and experimental aesthetics.

## Fun Facts
- Ian Lynch moved to London at age 19 to pursue music, spending a year street busking and living in squats before returning to Ireland to form Lynched with his brother Daragh.
- The band's formation as a four-piece was spontaneous and organic—when recording *Cold Old Fire* in 2014, the Lynch brothers invited Cormac MacDiarmada and Radie Peat to play on just a few songs, but the collaboration worked so well that they decided to continue as a full band.
- The title track from *Cold Old Fire* became a signature song for the band and serves as a snapshot of Irish austerity, with visionary lyrics imagining Dublin as a giant drone and the Button Factory (the main Dublin dole office) distributing ashes to those who fell through society's cracks.
- The band's name change from Lynched to Lankum was motivated by international touring—they realized the former name's punk connotations were only understood by 'a really specific radical left-wing punk audience' and limited their global appeal.
