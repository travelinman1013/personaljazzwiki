## Biography
The Magnolia Sisters is an all-female Cajun music band founded in 1995 by Ann Savoy and Jane Vidrine in southwest Louisiana, evolving from their decade-long collaboration to bring a woman's voice to traditional Cajun music while preserving its soulful, gutsy essence. Led by multi-instrumentalist, author, record producer, and photographer Ann Savoy—who notably recorded the Grammy-nominated album 'Adieu False Heart' with Linda Ronstadt—the group plays a wide range of French music styles from Louisiana, including dancehall Cajun, primitive Creole, house music, and front porch ballads, reviving long-buried Cajun songs with fresh interpretations.[1][2][4][6]

The band's core members include Ann Savoy, Jane Vidrine, Anya Burgess, and Lisa Trahan, with earlier lineups also featuring Christine Balfa; they are not biologically related but bonded by their deep passion for Cajun traditions. Louisiana natives like Lisa Trahan (daughter of accordionist Harry Trahan and grand-niece of 1920s recording artist Bixby Guidry, raised in Scott) and Christine Balfa (youngest daughter of legendary Dewey Balfa, from rural Tepetate near Basile) bring authentic roots, while all members perform in other acclaimed bands such as Savoy-Doucet Cajun Band, Nez-Piqué, Vieux Temps, and Balfa Toujours. Their repertoire stays faithful to old-time sounds but offers feminine perspectives on traditionally male-viewpoint songs, incorporating American folk tunes in English, and they perform at festivals, weddings, and have toured extensively in Europe and the US.[3][6][7]

With releases like their debut self-titled CD and later albums such as 'Stripped Down' on Smithsonian Folkways, the Magnolia Sisters have earned Grammy nominations for their two most recent CDs, praised as gifted musicians and trusted folklorists keeping Cajun traditions alive. Based in Lafayette, Louisiana—the heart of Cajun country—they challenge the male-dominated history of the genre, which began with recordings by Joe and Cleoma Falcon in 1928, by providing a distinctive 'woman's touch' to this rustic heritage.[6][9][10]
