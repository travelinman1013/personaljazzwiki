## Biography
Mark "Muleman" Massey is a blues guitarist and vocalist born and raised in Clarksdale, Mississippi, a city renowned as the cradle of the Delta blues. The grandson of sharecroppers, Massey grew up surrounded by the legacy of the blues, though music was not his primary focus during his youth. His life took a dramatic turn at age 19 when he was incarcerated at Mississippi's infamous Parchman Farm penitentiary. It was there, in the heart of the Delta, that Massey discovered his true calling: the blues. Under the tutelage of fellow inmates, including the legendary David Kimbrough, he learned the fundamentals of blues guitar and vocals, channeling his hardships into a raw, authentic musical style.[4][6][7][8]

After his release, Massey began performing in the Mississippi hill country and quickly gained a reputation for his soulful, world-class bluesmanship. His music is deeply rooted in the traditions of Delta and hill country blues, characterized by gritty vocals, expressive guitar work, and a deep sense of storytelling. Massey has since become a fixture on the Southern blues circuit, leading his own band and collaborating with Grammy-winning artists. His 2025 album "Been a Long, Long Time" has been praised for its authenticity and emotional depth, solidifying his place as a torchbearer of the Mississippi blues tradition.[1][3][4]

Massey's legacy is one of resilience and transformation, turning personal adversity into musical triumph. His journey from Parchman Prison to acclaimed bluesman is a testament to the enduring power of the blues as both a personal and cultural force. Through his performances and recordings, he continues to inspire audiences and keep the spirit of Delta blues alive for new generations.[5][7][8]
