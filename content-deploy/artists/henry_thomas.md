## Biography
Henry Thomas, known as "Ragtime Texas," was born in 1874 in Big Sandy, Texas, into a family of freed slaves who worked as sharecroppers. Disliking cotton farming, Thomas left home as a teenager around 1890 and began a life as an itinerant songster, traveling the Texas railroad lines and performing for local communities and railway workers[1][2][4]. He taught himself to play the quills—a type of American panpipe—and later the guitar, developing a distinctive style that blended ragtime, early blues, and folk traditions[2][3].

Thomas's recording career was brief but influential. Between 1927 and 1929, he recorded 23 sides for Vocalion Records in Chicago, showcasing a repertoire that included reels, gospel songs, minstrel tunes, ragtime numbers, and blues[1][3][4]. His guitar work, marked by intricate treble picking and drone bass, is considered among the finest early blues recordings, and his use of the quills added a unique texture to his music[2][3]. Notable tracks include "Bull Doze Blues," "Fishin' Blues," and "Railroadin' Some." His nickname "Ragtime Texas" reflected his fast tempos and ragtime influences, which were immediate forerunners and rivals of the emerging blues genre[2][4].

Thomas's legacy lies in his role as a transitional figure between minstrel, folk, and blues traditions. His recordings are regarded as a critical link between pre-blues songster styles and the structured blues and jazz forms that followed. Although his music was considered somewhat old-fashioned by the time of his recording sessions, it later gained renewed attention, especially when "Bull Doze Blues" was adapted by Canned Heat as "Going Up the Country," introducing Thomas's sound to new audiences and cementing his influence on American music[3].

## Fun Facts
- Henry Thomas was one of the earliest-born rural Black musicians to record, predating contemporaries like Lead Belly and Blind Lemon Jefferson[4].
- He played the quills, a rare folk instrument similar to panpipes, which gave his recordings a distinctive sound[1][2].
- Thomas's travels as a hobo likely took him to the World's Fairs in Chicago (1893) and St. Louis (1904)[4].
- Despite his influence, very little is known about his life after his recording sessions, and his exact date of death remains uncertain[3][4].
