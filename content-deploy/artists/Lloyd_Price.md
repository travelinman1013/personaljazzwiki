## Biography
Lloyd Price, born March 9, 1933, in Kenner, Louisiana, emerged from humble beginnings as one of 11 children in a family that ran a local restaurant. Immersed in music from a young age, he sang in a gospel choir and received formal training in trumpet and piano. His breakthrough came in 1952 with the recording of 'Lawdy Miss Clawdy' at J&M Studios in New Orleans, featuring Fats Domino on piano. The song became a landmark hit, topping the R&B charts for seven weeks and making Price the first teenager to sell a million records, helping to bridge racial divides in American popular music.[1][2][4][7]

After serving in the Army from 1953 to 1955, Price returned to a changed music industry but quickly re-established himself with hits like 'Stagger Lee,' 'Personality,' and 'I'm Gonna Get Married.' He became known as 'Mr. Personality' and was a constant presence on the national touring circuit. Price was also a pioneering African-American entrepreneur, founding several record labels (including KRC, Double L, and Turntable Records), opening nightclubs, and later branching into boxing promotion and real estate. His influence extended into the 21st century, with honors including induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and the National Rhythm & Blues Hall of Fame. Price passed away in May 2021 at the age of 88, leaving a legacy as a trailblazer in both music and business.[1][5][6]
