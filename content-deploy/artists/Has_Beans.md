## Biography
The Has Beans are a dynamic Cajun and zydeco supergroup originating from Lafayette, Louisiana, a region renowned for its vibrant musical traditions. Formed by seasoned musicians who previously played with some of the most influential Cajun bands—including File’, the Basin Brothers, Hadley J. Castille’s Sharecroppers, Coteau, and the Red Beans and Rice Revue—the Has Beans emerged as a collective dedicated to celebrating and evolving the sounds of South Louisiana. Their repertoire is eclectic, spanning Cajun, Zydeco, Creole, classic rhythm and blues, and even original compositions, all infused with the unmistakable groove of their home region.

Each member of the Has Beans—Danny Kimball (drums), Ward Lormand (accordion), Blake Castille (guitar), Phil Kaelin (guitar), Tommy Bodin (bass), and Henry Hample (fiddle)—brought decades of experience and a deep reverence for the musical legends who shaped Cajun and Creole music. Their performances are known for blending tradition with innovation, often reinterpreting classic songs from various genres to create a unique, danceable sound. The band’s name and inspiration are drawn from the Red Beans and Rice Revue, a group that played a pivotal role in popularizing Cajun music among the youth of South Louisiana in the 1970s.

The Has Beans are celebrated for their fearless approach to genre, unafraid to color outside the lines while always maintaining a strong South Louisiana groove. Their legacy lies in their ability to both honor and expand the rich musical heritage of their region, making them a staple of the Lafayette music scene and a favorite at festivals and dance halls throughout the area.
