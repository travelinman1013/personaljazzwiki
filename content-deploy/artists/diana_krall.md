## Biography
Diana Krall, born November 16, 1964, in Nanaimo, British Columbia, Canada, grew up in a musically rich environment, with both parents and her grandmother nurturing her early interest in music. She began classical piano lessons at age four and was soon captivated by her father's extensive collection of Fats Waller and jazz records, which deeply influenced her musical direction. By age 15, Krall was performing jazz piano professionally in local restaurants and was an active member of her high school jazz band.

Krall earned a scholarship to the prestigious Berklee College of Music in Boston, where she studied for over a year before returning to Canada. Her talent caught the attention of legendary bassist Ray Brown, who encouraged her to move to Los Angeles and study with renowned pianist Jimmy Rowles. Rowles was instrumental in persuading Krall to develop her vocal abilities alongside her piano skills. Krall's debut album, 'Stepping Out,' was released in 1993, followed by a series of acclaimed recordings that showcased her sophisticated jazz interpretations and elegant piano technique. Her 1999 album 'When I Look in Your Eyes' marked a major breakthrough, earning her a Grammy Award and establishing her as a leading figure in contemporary jazz.

Krall's musical style is characterized by her smooth contralto vocals, refined piano accompaniment, and a repertoire that blends jazz standards with contemporary influences. She is celebrated for her ability to reinterpret classics with subtlety and emotional depth, often accompanied by understated rhythm sections or lush string arrangements. Over her career, Krall has sold over 15 million albums worldwide and has become one of the most influential jazz artists of her generation, earning multiple Grammy and Juno Awards and recognition as an Officer of the Order of Canada.
