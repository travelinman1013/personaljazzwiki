## Biography
Harry Connick Jr. was born Joseph Harry Fowler Connick, Jr. on September 11, 1967, in New Orleans, Louisiana—a city whose rich musical heritage profoundly shaped his artistic development[1][3][6]. He began performing as a pianist and vocalist at the age of five, quickly establishing himself as a prodigy rooted in the traditions of jazz, big band, and the sounds of his hometown[3][6][7]. In the mid-1980s, Connick moved to New York to study at Hunter College and the Manhattan School of Music, where his talent caught the attention of Columbia Records executive Dr. George Butler, leading to his first major-label release in 1987[1][5].

Connick's breakthrough came with the soundtrack for the 1989 film 'When Harry Met Sally...', which earned him a Grammy Award and double-platinum status, showcasing his suave vocal style reminiscent of Frank Sinatra and Tony Bennett[2][3]. Over the next three decades, Connick released more than 25 albums spanning jazz, big band, funk, and holiday music, selling over 28 million copies worldwide[1][3]. His versatility extended to acting, with roles in films such as 'Memphis Belle', 'Independence Day', and 'Hope Floats', as well as television appearances on 'Will & Grace' and as a judge on 'American Idol'[1][2][4].

Connick's musical style is deeply rooted in New Orleans jazz, vocal standards, and big band traditions, but he has also explored funk and gospel, as seen in albums like 'She' and 'Alone With My Faith'[3][8]. His legacy includes multiple Grammy and Emmy awards, Tony nominations, and a reputation as one of the most accomplished entertainers of his generation, celebrated for both his technical mastery and his ability to bridge genres while honoring the spirit of his hometown[3][1][6].
