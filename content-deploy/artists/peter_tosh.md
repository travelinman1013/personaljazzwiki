## Biography
Peter Tosh, born Winston Hubert McIntosh on October 19, 1944, in Westmoreland, Jamaica, emerged as one of reggae’s most influential and outspoken figures. Raised in a challenging environment, Tosh found solace in music early, learning to play guitar and other instruments largely on his own, with only brief formal instruction. His formative years were shaped by both his Christian upbringing and the vibrant musical culture of Kingston’s Trenchtown, where he was drawn to American R&B and local Caribbean sounds.

In 1962, Tosh met Bob Marley and Bunny Wailer through vocal teacher Joe Higgs, leading to the formation of The Wailers in 1963. Tosh was the group’s instrumental backbone, teaching his bandmates and helping to shape the emerging reggae sound by blending ska, rocksteady, and soul influences. After international success with The Wailers, Tosh left in 1974 to launch a solo career marked by militant lyrics and uncompromising advocacy for social justice. His solo albums, including 'Legalize It' and 'Equal Rights,' became anthems for marijuana legalization and human rights, while his later work continued to address issues like apartheid and nuclear disarmament. Tosh remained a powerful voice for Rastafari and Black liberation until his untimely death in 1987, when he was murdered during a home invasion in Kingston.

Tosh’s legacy endures as a pioneering reggae artist and activist. He is remembered for his distinctive baritone, instrumental prowess, and fearless political engagement, which inspired generations of musicians and activists worldwide.
