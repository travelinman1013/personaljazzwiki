## Biography
Jewel Kilcher, known professionally as Jewel, was born on May 23, 1974, in Payson, Utah, and raised in the remote wilderness of Alaska. Her early life was deeply musical: she began performing at age six alongside her parents, both singer-songwriters, and learned to yodel from her father. After her parents' divorce, Jewel continued touring with her father, honing her performance skills in bars and local venues. At 15, she earned a scholarship to the Interlochen Arts Academy in Michigan, where she studied operatic voice and began writing her own songs, later moving to San Diego to pursue music independently[1][3][5].

Jewel's breakthrough came after years of performing in coffeehouses and living out of her van, when she was discovered by manager Inga Vainshtein and signed to Atlantic Records in 1994. Her debut album, 'Pieces of You' (1995), initially saw slow sales but exploded in popularity after relentless touring, including opening for Bob Dylan and Neil Young. The album, featuring hits like 'Who Will Save Your Soul' and 'You Were Meant for Me,' became one of the best-selling debuts of all time, with over 12 million copies sold in the U.S. alone. Jewel's music blends folk, pop, and country, characterized by poetic lyrics and emotive vocals, and she has continued to experiment across genres throughout her career, earning critical acclaim and multiple awards[1][2][3].

Beyond her musical achievements, Jewel is also a published poet, actress, and mental health advocate. She has maintained a focus on authenticity and mindfulness, often drawing from her personal struggles and resilience in her songwriting. Her legacy includes not only her multi-platinum records and influence on the singer-songwriter genre but also her role as a voice for emotional honesty and self-empowerment in popular music[2][6].
