## Biography
Joel Hopkins, born on January 3, 1904, in Centerville, Texas, USA, was a country blues guitarist and singer, best known as the elder brother of the renowned blues musician Lightnin' Hopkins. Growing up in the rural Texas blues tradition, Joel learned guitar alongside his siblings, including Lightnin' (Sam) and John Henry Hopkins, immersing himself in the acoustic country blues style prevalent in East Texas during the early 20th century. His musical style featured raw, rhythmic fingerpicking and heartfelt vocals, characteristic of the pre-war blues era, as heard in his sparse solo recordings and family collaborations[1][3][4].

Joel's recording career began modestly in the late 1920s when he cut six songs for Paramount Records in 1930, issued on three 78 RPM records, marking him as a minor but authentic figure in early blues history. He largely remained outside the commercial spotlight, performing locally and occasionally joining his brothers for informal sessions, until the 1960s folk-blues revival brought renewed attention. In 1964, he participated in recordings with Lightnin' Hopkins and John Henry in Waxahachie, Texas, capturing traditional family-style blues performances produced by Chris Strachwitz for Arhoolie Records. These tracks, including Joel's composition 'I Walked from Dallas,' appeared on the 1966 album Lightning Hopkins with His Brothers Joel and John Henry / with Barbara Dane[2][5].

Joel Hopkins passed away on February 15, 1975, in Galveston, Texas, leaving a small but genuine legacy within the Hopkins family blues dynasty. His contributions, though limited in discography, exemplify the unpolished, acoustic blues of Texas sharecroppers, preserved through reissues and blues historiography rather than widespread fame[1][3].

## Fun Facts
- Joel recorded only six songs in his entire career, all for Paramount Records in 1930, making his discography one of the sparsest among notable early blues artists[1][5].
- His composition 'I Walked from Dallas' was featured on the 1966 Arhoolie album alongside tracks by his brothers, one of the few times his original work was documented[2].
- Sessions with his brothers were captured in informal settings like Waxahachie, Texas, in February 1964, highlighting the raw, family-rooted nature of their music[2].
- Despite being Lightnin' Hopkins' brother, Joel's modern streaming popularity on platforms like Spotify remains at 0, reflecting his obscurity outside blues collector circles[context].
