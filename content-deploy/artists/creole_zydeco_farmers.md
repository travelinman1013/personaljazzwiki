## Biography
Creole Zydeco Farmers are a Louisiana Creole zydeco band formed in the early 1990s in Lafayette, Louisiana, emerging directly from the legacy of Fernest & the Thunders after the retirement of frontman Fernest Arceneaux.[2][7] Founding members Clarence “Jockey” Etienne (drums) and Chester Chevalier (guitar), both veterans of Arceneaux’s band, recruited vocalists and accordionists Walter (John) Prejean Sr. and Morris Francis to create a new ensemble that would keep Lafayette Parish’s rural Creole dance‑hall traditions alive while touring clubs, trail rides, and festivals across southwest Louisiana.[2][7] The group’s sound is rooted in the older la‑la and rural zydeco tradition of southwest Louisiana Creoles, emphasizing French‑Creole vocals, driving two‑steps and waltzes, and a stripped‑down, groove‑oriented rhythm section.[2][3]

Musically, Creole Zydeco Farmers are known as torchbearers of **traditional Creole zydeco**, blending button or piano accordion, scrubboard (frottoir), and guitar with blues‑inflected vocals and a repertoire that bridges house‑party tunes, dancehall standards, and original material.[2] Their album *On the Road*, released on Floyd Soileau’s Maison de Soul label (a key imprint for rural zydeco), is often cited as their signature recording and helped solidify their reputation among genre aficionados in the 1990s and 2000s.[2][7] Although they have a modest mainstream profile, within the zydeco community the band is respected for maintaining a classic Creole groove and for carrying forward the rhythmic feel, French lyrics, and community‑based dance culture that link contemporary zydeco to its origins among southwest Louisiana Creole farmers and laborers.[2][3][8]

Over the years, Creole Zydeco Farmers have been part of a broader preservationist current in Cajun and Creole music, paralleling the efforts that kept traditional Cajun and rural Creole styles from being eclipsed by more commercial sounds.[3][8] Through live performances, recordings, and the continuity provided by veteran musicians like Etienne and Chevalier, they form a living bridge between the era of Fernest Arceneaux and the modern zydeco scene, sustaining repertory, grooves, and performance practices that reach back to mid‑20th‑century Creole dance halls.[2][3][7]
