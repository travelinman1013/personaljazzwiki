## Biography
Dolly Parton and Linda Perry are two distinct but deeply connected figures in popular music whose careers intersect through songwriting, collaboration, and mutual admiration. Dolly Parton, born January 19, 1946, in Locust Ridge, Tennessee, rose from rural poverty and early radio and television appearances to become one of country music’s most prolific singer‑songwriters and crossover stars, known for classics like “Jolene,” “I Will Always Love You,” and “9 to 5.” Linda Perry, born April 15, 1965, in Springfield, Massachusetts, first gained prominence as the frontwoman and primary songwriter of the rock band 4 Non Blondes, writing and singing the 1993 hit “What’s Up?” before reinventing herself in the 2000s as a sought‑after songwriter and producer for major pop artists.[2]

Parton’s career developed from Nashville country in the 1960s and 1970s to global pop‑country success, with a signature style blending Appalachian roots, sharp storytelling, and a playful, self‑aware image that helped her transition into film, television, and philanthropy. Perry’s trajectory moved from alternative rock to behind‑the‑scenes hitmaking, co‑writing and producing pivotal songs and albums for Pink (“Get the Party Started,” much of *Missundaztood*), Christina Aguilera (“Beautiful”), Gwen Stefani (“What You Waiting For?”), and others, giving her a reputation as a writer‑producer who draws raw, emotional performances from vocalists.[2] Their professional relationship began when they were brought together to create music for the 2018 Netflix film *Dumplin’*, where they co‑wrote new songs including “Girl in the Movies,” expanding a single brief to a full slate of material and earning a Golden Globe and Grammy‑nominated centerpiece track.[1][2][5] Since then they have maintained an ongoing friendship and creative partnership, highlighted by Parton’s 2023 rock album *Rockstar*, on which she covers “What’s Up?” as a duet with Perry, framing Perry’s 1990s anthem through Parton’s new rock‑leaning lens.[3][4]

Artistically, Parton is associated with country, bluegrass, and pop‑country, characterized by narrative songwriting, humor, vulnerability, and strong melodic hooks, while Perry is associated with alternative rock and pop, characterized by anthemic choruses, confessional lyrics, and a production style that foregrounds powerful vocals.[2] Their collaborations bring these sensibilities together: Perry has spoken of being a lifelong Parton fan and instantly insisting she was “the girl” for the *Dumplin’* job, while Parton—who rarely co‑writes—has said they “clicked” immediately and kept writing beyond what was requested because they were so inspired.[1][5] In recent years, their work and public appearances have positioned them as cross‑generational creative peers, with Parton embracing rock and contemporary pop idioms and Perry further cementing her legacy as a bridge between alternative rock and mainstream pop, now also intertwined with modern country iconography through her work with Parton.[1][3][4]
