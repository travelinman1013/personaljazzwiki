## Biography
Oscar Phillip "Papa" Celestin (January 1, 1884 – December 15, 1954) was a pioneering New Orleans jazz cornetist, trumpeter, and beloved bandleader. Born in Napoleonville, Louisiana, to a Creole family, Celestin worked on rural plantations in his youth before moving to New Orleans in 1906. He began his musical journey with the Algiers Brass Band under Henry Allen Sr., quickly establishing himself in the vibrant local scene.

In 1910, Celestin co-founded the Original Tuxedo Jazz Orchestra with trombonist William "Baba" Ridgley, a group that would become one of the most influential and enduring ensembles in New Orleans jazz history. The Tuxedo Jazz Band was among the first to record jazz in New Orleans, producing notable tracks like "Original Tuxedo Rag" and "Black Rag" in the 1920s. Celestin's leadership style was open-minded and inclusive, employing women musicians and building a racially diverse following. Despite the challenges of the Great Depression, which forced him to temporarily leave music for shipyard work, Celestin returned to lead a new Tuxedo Brass Band after World War II, becoming a fixture on Bourbon Street and a symbol of the New Orleans jazz revival of the 1950s.

Celestin's musical style blended ragtime, Dixieland, and the blues, characterized by his sweet trumpet tone and distinctive, gravelly vocals. He was celebrated for his showmanship and ability to connect with audiences across social divides. His legacy endures through his recordings, the continued existence of the Tuxedo Jazz Band, and his influence on generations of jazz musicians. When he died in 1954, his funeral drew thousands, reflecting his status as a cultural icon in New Orleans.
