## Biography
Herman "Junior" Parker (March 27, 1932 – November 18, 1971), also known as Little Junior Parker, was an influential American blues singer and harmonica player, celebrated for his 'honeyed' and 'velvet-smooth' vocal style. Born on Eastover Plantation near Bobo, Coahoma County, Mississippi, Parker moved with his mother to West Memphis, Arkansas, in the 1940s. He began singing in gospel groups as a child and, as a teenager, immersed himself in the vibrant postwar Memphis blues scene, learning harmonica from Sonny Boy Williamson II and working with Howlin’ Wolf before forming his own band, the Blue Flames, in 1951.[1][2][3][4]

Parker's early career was shaped by his association with key figures in blues, including Ike Turner, who recorded his first single in 1952. Signing with Sun Records in 1953, Parker and the Blue Flames scored a hit with 'Feelin’ Good,' followed by 'Love My Baby' and 'Mystery Train'—the latter later famously covered by Elvis Presley. In 1955, Parker joined Duke Records, touring extensively with Bobby 'Blue' Bland and leading the successful Blues Consolidated Revue. He enjoyed a string of R&B hits through the 1950s and early 1960s, including 'Next Time You See Me,' 'Driving Wheel,' and 'Stand by Me.'[1][2][3][4]

Parker’s style evolved from down-home harmonica blues to a more urbane, soulful sound, helping bridge the gap between blues and soul. His smooth delivery and innovative approach influenced both contemporaries and future generations of musicians. Inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame and the Mississippi Musicians Hall of Fame, Parker remains a pivotal figure in the evolution of modern blues and soul music.[2][3][4]

## Fun Facts
- Parker's 'Mystery Train' was famously covered by Elvis Presley, who borrowed the guitar riff from Parker's 'Love My Baby.'
- He was known for his exceptionally smooth, soulful voice, which stood out in the blues genre often dominated by rougher vocal styles.
- Parker was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 2001 and the Mississippi Musicians Hall of Fame.
- His real name may have been Herbert Parker, according to some research, though he is widely known as Herman Parker, Jr.
