## Biography
Prince Rogers Nelson, born on June 7, 1958, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, emerged as one of the most innovative and influential artists in modern music. Raised in a musical family—his father, John Nelson, was a jazz pianist and his mother, Mattie Shaw, a jazz singer—Prince began playing piano at age 7 and quickly mastered guitar and drums, forming his first band at 14. Despite a turbulent childhood marked by his parents’ separation and frequent moves, Prince found stability and creative partnership with André Cymone, with whom he formed the band Grand Central during high school[1][2][3][4][5].

Prince signed with Warner Bros. Records at 18, releasing his debut album 'For You' in 1978, followed by a string of groundbreaking records that fused funk, rock, pop, and R&B. His provocative blend of sexual and religious themes, virtuosic musicianship, and flamboyant stage presence set him apart. The 1984 album 'Purple Rain' and its accompanying film catapulted Prince to global superstardom, earning him an Academy Award and multiple Grammys. Over his career, Prince released dozens of albums, including '1999,' 'Sign o' the Times,' and 'Diamonds and Pearls,' and was known for his prodigious output, genre-defying style, and fiercely independent approach to the music industry[1][3][5].

Prince’s legacy is defined by his relentless creativity, advocacy for artistic freedom, and profound impact on popular music. He pioneered the 'Minneapolis sound,' mentored and collaborated with countless artists, and inspired generations with his boundary-pushing artistry. Prince died on April 21, 2016, from an accidental drug overdose, leaving behind a vast catalog and an enduring influence on music and culture[3][5].
