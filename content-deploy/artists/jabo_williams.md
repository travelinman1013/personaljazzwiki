## Biography
Jabo Williams (possibly born in 1895, died 1953 or 1954) was an American boogie-woogie and blues pianist and songwriter, whose life remains largely shrouded in mystery. Born in Birmingham, Alabama, Williams emerged as a talented pianist and vocalist, eventually relocating to St. Louis, Missouri, a city known for its vibrant blues scene. His career is documented almost exclusively through the eight tracks he recorded for Paramount Records in Grafton, Wisconsin, in May 1932, which represent his entire known recorded output.[3][1][5]

Williams' piano style was characterized by energetic barrelhouse rhythms, intricate left-hand patterns, and a raw, driving boogie-woogie feel. His recordings, such as 'Pratt City Blues' and 'Jabbo Stomp,' showcase a distinctive approach that blends elements of ragtime and early blues, marking him as a unique voice among his contemporaries. Despite the brevity of his recording career, his work has been celebrated by blues and piano enthusiasts for its originality and technical prowess.[1][6]

Little is known about Williams' life after his Paramount sessions. There are no confirmed photographs, and details about his later years and death remain uncertain. Nevertheless, his recordings have achieved a cult status, influencing later generations of blues and boogie-woogie pianists and securing his legacy as a foundational figure in early American blues piano.[3][7]
