## Biography
Tame Impala is the acclaimed psychedelic music project led by Australian multi-instrumentalist and producer Kevin Parker. Born in Sydney in 1986 and raised in Perth, Parker was immersed in music from a young age, influenced by his parents' diverse backgrounds—his father from Zimbabwe and his mother from South Africa. He began experimenting with recording and producing music as a teenager, often collaborating with childhood friend Dominic Simper and participating in the local Perth music scene. Early projects included The Dee Dee Dums and stints as a drummer for bands like Mink Mussel Creek and Pond.

Tame Impala officially emerged in 2007 as Parker's home-recorded solo endeavor, with the debut EP released in 2008. The project's breakthrough came with the album 'Innerspeaker' (2010), which introduced a lush, neo-psychedelic sound blending 1960s influences with modern pop and electronic elements. Subsequent albums—'Lonerism' (2012), 'Currents' (2015), 'The Slow Rush' (2020), and 'Deadbeat' (2025)—cemented Parker's reputation for innovative production and introspective songwriting. Tame Impala's music is characterized by swirling synths, dreamy vocals, and intricate rhythms, earning Parker multiple ARIA Awards, a Brit Award, and a Grammy.

Parker's meticulous approach, often writing, performing, and producing every element himself, has made Tame Impala a global phenomenon. The project has revitalized psychedelic music for a new generation, influencing artists across genres and collaborating with major pop and hip-hop acts. Tame Impala's legacy lies in its seamless fusion of retro and contemporary sounds, and its profound impact on modern alternative music.

## Fun Facts
- Kevin Parker records, produces, and performs nearly all of Tame Impala's music himself, playing every instrument on studio albums.
- The name 'Tame Impala' was chosen to evoke the idea of a 'wild African antelope' and Parker's fascination with the concept of taming something wild.
- Parker fractured his hip during a marathon in 2023 due to an underlying condition, but made a full recovery.
- Before Tame Impala, Parker was the drummer for the band Pond and was involved in several other Perth-based music projects.
