## Biography
Johnny Maestro, born John Peter Mastrangelo on May 7, 1939, in Brooklyn, New York, was a pioneering American singer best known for his work in the doo-wop and pop genres. Raised on Manhattan’s Lower East Side, Maestro began his music career in 1957 as the original lead singer of The Crests, one of the first interracial vocal groups in the recording industry. The Crests achieved major success with hits such as '16 Candles,' which peaked at No. 2 on the US charts in 1959, as well as 'Step by Step,' 'The Angels Listened In,' and 'Trouble in Paradise.' Maestro’s smooth tenor and emotive delivery helped define the group’s sound and contributed to the enduring popularity of their recordings.[1][2][3][4][5][6]

After leaving The Crests in 1961, Maestro pursued a solo career, scoring Top 40 hits with 'Model Girl' and 'What a Surprise.' In 1968, he joined forces with The Del-Satins—a group known for backing Dion on his post-Belmonts hits—and the Long Island band Rhythm Method, forming the 11-piece ensemble Brooklyn Bridge. Their debut single, 'The Worst That Could Happen,' became a gold record and reached No. 3 on the charts in 1969. The group followed with additional hits, including 'Blessed Is the Rain,' 'Welcome Me Love,' and 'Your Husband, My Wife.' Maestro continued to perform with various lineups of Brooklyn Bridge until his death from cancer on March 24, 2010, in Cape Coral, Florida, leaving a lasting legacy as a key figure in American vocal group history.[2][3][4][6]
