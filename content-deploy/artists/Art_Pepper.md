## Biography
Art Pepper, born Arthur Edward Pepper Jr. on September 1, 1925, in Gardena, California, began his musical journey early.  His childhood was marked by the alcoholism and violence of his parents, leading to his placement with his grandmother.  He displayed musical talent from a young age, starting with clarinet at nine and switching to alto saxophone at thirteen.  He quickly began performing on Central Avenue, Los Angeles's vibrant Black nightclub district, honing his skills and absorbing the rich musical atmosphere.

His professional career launched at seventeen with Benny Carter, followed by a significant stint with Stan Kenton's big band.  Military service interrupted his momentum in 1943, but upon returning, he rejoined Kenton's Innovations Orchestra.  By the 1950s, he was a leading alto saxophonist, even placing second to Charlie Parker in a 1952 DownBeat magazine poll.  He's often associated with West Coast jazz, alongside Chet Baker, Gerry Mulligan, and Shelly Manne, though his style differed from the "hot" jazz of East Coast contemporaries like Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, and [[miles_davis]].  Notable recordings from this period include *Art Pepper Meets the Rhythm Section*, *Art Pepper + Eleven – Modern Jazz Classics*, *Gettin' Together*, *Smack Up*, and collaborations with Warne Marsh, such as *Art Pepper with Warne Marsh* (also known as *The Way It Was!*).  His career was punctuated by several prison sentences due to heroin addiction, yet he consistently produced high-quality music throughout his life.  Later in his career, he was a member of Buddy Rich's Big Band (1968-1969), toured internationally, and recorded extensively for Galaxy Records, with albums like *Living Legend*, *Art Pepper Today*, *Among Friends*, and *Live in Japan*.  In the mid-1970s, he began methadone therapy.

Art Pepper's musical style was characterized by emotionally charged performances and stylistic shifts throughout his career.  He was known for his virtuosity on the alto saxophone, but also played tenor saxophone, clarinet, and bass clarinet.  Scott Yanow described him as having "attained his goal of becoming the world's greatest altoist" at the time of his death in 1982.  His autobiography, *Straight Life*, co-written with his wife Laurie, offers insight into his life and the jazz world.  A documentary film, *Art Pepper: Notes from a Jazz Survivor*, further documented his life and career.  He died of a stroke on June 15, 1982, in Los Angeles, leaving behind a substantial body of work and a lasting influence on jazz music.
