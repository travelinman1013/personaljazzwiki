## Biography
Dr. Michael White, born November 29, 1954, in New Orleans, Louisiana, is a renowned jazz clarinetist, bandleader, composer, historian, and educator. Raised in a family with deep musical roots—his relatives played with early jazz icons like King Oliver and Kid Ory—White was initially influenced by his aunt, a classical clarinetist, and honed his skills in the St. Augustine's School Marching Band. He pursued higher education at Xavier University (B.A., 1976) and Tulane University (M.A., 1979; Ph.D., 1984), balancing his academic pursuits with a growing passion for traditional New Orleans jazz.[1][3][4]

White's career began in earnest as a teenager, performing with Doc Paulin's Brass Band and later joining the Fairview Baptist Church Brass Band under the mentorship of Danny Barker. He became a key figure in the Young Tuxedo Brass Band and founded The Original Liberty Jazz Band in 1981 to preserve New Orleans' jazz heritage. White's clarinet style draws from the Creole and blues traditions, inspired by legends like Johnny Dodds, George Lewis, and Sidney Bechet. He has recorded extensively, collaborated with Wynton Marsalis on the acclaimed album 'The Majesty of the Blues,' and led performances at prestigious venues such as Lincoln Center and the Village Vanguard. As an educator, he holds the Keller Endowed Chair at Xavier University and is celebrated for his efforts to keep the spirit and legacy of New Orleans jazz alive, especially in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.[1][2][3][4]
