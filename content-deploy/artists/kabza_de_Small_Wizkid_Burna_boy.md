## Biography
Kabza De Small, born Kabelo Petrus Motha on November 27, 1992, in eMalahleni, Mpumalanga, South Africa, is a pioneering DJ and record producer widely celebrated as the 'King of Amapiano.' Raised in Pretoria, Kabza began his musical journey in 2009, initially exploring Afro-fused house and EDM before gravitating toward the emerging Amapiano sound. His debut album, 'Avenue Sound' (2016), marked his entry into the South African music scene, but it was the 2018 single 'Umshove' featuring Leehleza that propelled him to national prominence and established him as a leading figure in the genre.

Kabza's career reached new heights through his collaboration with DJ Maphorisa, forming the influential duo Scorpion Kings. Together, they released a series of acclaimed projects, including 'Scorpion Kings' (2019), 'Piano Hub' (2019), and 'Rumble in the Jungle' (2021) with TRESOR, which played a crucial role in popularizing Amapiano both locally and internationally. Kabza's music is characterized by its fusion of deep house, jazz, and kwaito elements, creating a distinctive and infectious sound that has garnered millions of streams and a devoted global fanbase. His 2020 double album, 'I Am the King of Amapiano: Sweet & Dust,' further showcased his versatility and solidified his legacy as a genre-defining artist.

Despite facing early career challenges, including financial struggles and skepticism from his community, Kabza's perseverance and innovative approach have earned him widespread acclaim, including multiple South African Music Awards and recognition on Forbes Africa's '30 under 30' list. He remains a private individual, recently marrying his longtime partner Kamogelo Moropa, and continues to shape the evolution of Amapiano through both his solo work and prolific collaborations.
