## Biography
Doug MacLeod, born April 21, 1946 in New York City, is a celebrated American blues musician renowned for his storytelling, acoustic guitar prowess, and original songwriting. His early life was marked by adversity, including a severe stutter and abuse, which he overcame by turning to music—finding his voice through singing and guitar playing. After his family relocated several times, MacLeod spent his formative years in St. Louis, immersing himself in the local blues scene and performing as a bassist in various bands before serving in the Navy, where he continued to hone his craft in Northern Virginia under the mentorship of Ernest Banks[1][2].

MacLeod's career flourished after settling in Los Angeles, where he became a sought-after sideman for blues legends such as George "Harmonica" Smith, Big Joe Turner, Pee Wee Crayton, Eddie 'Cleanhead' Vinson, Lowell Fulson, and Big Mama Thornton[1][2]. Over more than four decades, he has released 29 studio albums, several live recordings, and instructional DVDs, earning multiple Blues Music Awards—including the 2024 Acoustic Album Of The Year for "Raw Blues 1" and the 2023 Acoustic Artist Of The Year[1]. His songs have been covered by artists like Albert King, Albert Collins, Joe Louis Walker, and Eva Cassidy, and have appeared in TV movies and series such as "In the Heat of the Night"[1][2].

MacLeod's musical style is deeply rooted in traditional blues, characterized by personal storytelling, soulful slide guitar, and a commitment to authenticity—adhering to the advice "Never write or sing about what you don't know about." He is recognized for carrying forward the blues tradition, both as a performer and educator, and his legacy includes influential radio hosting, magazine columns, and appearances in documentaries such as "Resonate: A Guitar Story"[1][2].
