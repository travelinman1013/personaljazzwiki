## Biography
Ida Lewis Guillory, born January 15, 1929, in Lake Charles, Louisiana, grew up in a French-speaking Creole community of rice farmers. Despite her parents' belief that the accordion was best suited for boys, she learned to play the diatonic button accordion as a teenager, inspired by her mother's musicianship and guided by her brother Al Lewis (later known as Al Rapone). After relocating to San Francisco in the 1960s with her husband Raymond Guillory, she balanced family life—raising three children—with work as a bus driver, while indirectly maintaining her connection to music by cooking traditional Louisiana dishes for her brother's zydeco band.

Queen Ida's professional career began in earnest in the early 1970s when her brother rekindled her interest in music. She initially performed with the Barbary Coast Band before forming her own ensemble, the Bon Temps Band. The nickname "Queen Ida" originated in 1975 when she was crowned Queen of the Mardi Gras at a church celebration; a San Francisco Chronicle reporter subsequently dubbed her "Queen Ida," and the name stuck. She became the first woman to lead a zydeco band, a distinction that quickly garnered attention from audiences and boosters alike. Her unique musical approach distinguished her from other zydeco artists—she favored a 31-button accordion (compared to the 11-button versions used by artists like Clifton Chenier), which allowed for greater melodic range and a more treble-heavy sound influenced by Mexican music.

Throughout her career, Queen Ida and the Bon Temps Zydeco Band achieved international prominence, touring extensively across North America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Oceania. Her 1982 album *On Tour* won a Grammy Award for Best Ethnic or Traditional Folk Recording, with three additional Grammy nominations across her career. Beyond music, she published a popular cookbook, *Cookin' with Queen Ida*, blending her culinary and musical talents. Her legacy as a pioneering female zydeco musician and cultural ambassador helped elevate zydeco music on the global stage, while her fusion of traditional Creole accordion with blues, R&B, Caribbean, and Mexican influences created a distinctive "Bayou Country Music" sound that remains influential in contemporary zydeco.
