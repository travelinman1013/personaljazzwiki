## Biography
Zachary Richard, born September 8, 1950 in Scott, Louisiana, is an acclaimed American singer-songwriter, poet, and cultural activist whose career spans over five decades. Raised in the heart of Cajun country, Richard began his musical journey as a soprano in the Bishop's Boys Choir at Saint John's Cathedral in Lafayette and later graduated summa cum laude from Tulane University in 1972. Deeply influenced by the French language and Cajun traditions of his heritage, he became a pioneering force in blending Cajun and zydeco music with elements of rock, folk, and pop, singing in both French and English.

Richard's early career took him from Louisiana to New York and then to Montreal, where he recorded several French-language albums that achieved gold and platinum status in Canada. His innovative approach helped popularize Cajun music internationally, especially in French-speaking regions. Throughout his career, Richard has released over sixteen studio albums, produced award-winning documentaries on Cajun and Acadian history, and remained a passionate advocate for the preservation of French language and culture in Louisiana. His legacy is marked by his role as a bridge between American and Francophone musical worlds, as well as his activism for cultural and environmental causes.
