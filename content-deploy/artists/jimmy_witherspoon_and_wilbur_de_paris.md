## Biography
Jimmy Witherspoon (August 8, 1920 – September 18, 1997) was an American jump blues and jazz singer born in Gurdon, Clark County, Arkansas. He first gained attention singing in Calcutta, India, with Teddy Weatherford's band during World War II over US Armed Forces Radio Service broadcasts. Returning to the US, he recorded his first sides with Jay McShann's band in 1945, made his debut under his own name in 1947, and achieved his signature hit 'Ain't Nobody's Business' in 1949 still with McShann. In 1956, Witherspoon collaborated with trombonist Wilbur De Paris and his New New Orleans Jazz Band on the album *New Orleans Blues* for Atlantic Records, an unusual venture blending his blues shouting style with traditional New Orleans jazz.[2][3][8]

Wilbur De Paris, a skilled trombonist and bandleader, began his career in 1919 in Philadelphia, playing C-melody saxophone before switching to trombone. He worked with bands including Jelly Roll Morton (1930), Louis Armstrong (1937-40), and Duke Ellington (1945-47), then formed his New New Orleans Jazz Band in the 1950s with his brother Sidney De Paris (trumpet) as star soloist. The band became the house group at Jimmy Ryan's in New York from 1951 for 11 years, recording albums like *That's a Plenty*. The 1956 session with Witherspoon marked a distinctive fusion of blues and trad jazz.[1][6][8]

Witherspoon's career spanned decades, with further hits in 1950, European tours including with Buck Clayton (1961), and 1970s collaborations like *Guilty!* with Eric Burdon. He continued performing into the 1990s and appeared in films such as *Georgia* (1995). His legacy endures as a quintessential blues shouter in the Big Joe Turner tradition, while De Paris preserved New Orleans jazz vitality.[2][4]
