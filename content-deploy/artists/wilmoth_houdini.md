## Biography
Wilmoth Houdini, born Frederick Wilmoth Hendricks on November 25, 1895, in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago, emerged as one of the most influential figures in early calypso music. He began his career in 1916 as a chantuelle (lead singer) with the African Millionaires masquerade band, performing in calypso tents and at carnival events in Trinidad. Before settling in New York City in 1927, Houdini worked on cargo ships, traveling throughout the Caribbean, Europe, and South America, experiences that broadened his musical outlook and repertoire.

Upon arriving in New York, Houdini quickly established himself as a pioneering calypsonian, recording prolifically for labels such as Victor, Decca, Okeh, and Brunswick. Between 1928 and 1940, he released over a hundred 78 RPM records, sometimes under the names Fredrick Wilmoth Hendricks, Edgar Leon Sinclair, or King Houdini. His music blended witty social commentary, storytelling, and infectious rhythms, helping to popularize calypso in the United States. His 1939 composition 'He Had It Coming' achieved international fame when Louis Jordan and Ella Fitzgerald re-recorded it as 'Stone Cold Dead in the Market,' topping the R&B charts and reaching the U.S. pop top 10 in 1946. Houdini's success made him a central figure in New York's Caribbean community, where he organized calypso festivals and promoted the genre's growth.

Despite his achievements, Houdini was sometimes criticized by Trinidadian contemporaries who accused him of appropriating their material. Nevertheless, his career catalyzed the first major wave of calypso's popularity in the U.S. during the 1930s and 1940s and influenced subsequent generations of musicians. He continued performing into the 1950s, notably at the Caribbean Club in Manhattan, and remained a respected ambassador for calypso until his death in New York City on August 6, 1973.

## Fun Facts
- Houdini is credited with creating the first recorded 'dis' or 'clash' record in calypso history, challenging rival Lord Executor in 1929—decades before similar traditions in hip hop or dancehall.
- He recorded under multiple aliases, including Fredrick Wilmoth Hendricks, Edgar Leon Sinclair (his U.S. passport name), and King Houdini.
- His song 'He Had It Coming' became a crossover hit in the U.S. when covered by Louis Jordan and Ella Fitzgerald as 'Stone Cold Dead in the Market,' reaching No. 1 on the R&B chart and No. 7 on the pop chart.
- Houdini was sometimes accused by fellow Trinidadian calypsonians of stealing their songs and copyrighting them in the United States, sparking musical feuds that played out in recorded 'war' songs.
