## Biography
Pachyman is the stage name of Pachy García, a multi-instrumentalist, producer, and dub innovator born in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico. Immersed in the island’s vibrant reggae and punk scenes from a young age, García played guitar and keys in local reggae bands throughout high school, developing a deep appreciation for the experimental and rhythmic possibilities of Caribbean music. In 2012, he relocated to Los Angeles, where he joined the post-punk band Prettiest Eyes and began exploring new musical directions, teaching himself drums and embracing a DIY approach to music-making.

By 2019, García launched his solo project as Pachyman, constructing a home studio (333 House) where he meticulously recreated the vintage sound of 1970s dub using analog gear and classic production techniques. His early albums paid homage to dub pioneers, but over time, Pachyman’s work evolved to incorporate elements of lovers rock, krautrock, chillwave, and Puerto Rican percussion, culminating in albums like 'Switched-On' (2023) and 'Another Place' (2025). Renowned for his live performances, where he mixes tracks in real time, Pachyman has become a leading figure in modern dub, extending the genre’s legacy with his cross-genre experimentation and personal touch.

Pachyman’s music is characterized by its reverence for repetition, space, and echo, but also by a willingness to push boundaries, blending influences from post-punk, jazz fusion, and electronic music. Through his self-produced recordings and engaging online presence, especially during the pandemic, he has both honored and expanded the tradition of dub, inspiring a new generation of listeners and musicians.
