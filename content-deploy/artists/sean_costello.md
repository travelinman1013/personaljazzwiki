## Biography
Sean Costello (April 16, 1979 – April 15, 2008) was an American blues musician renowned for his fiery guitar playing and soulful singing.[1][3] Born in Philadelphia, Costello moved to Atlanta at age nine, where he quickly became obsessed with the guitar after discovering Howlin' Wolf's 'Rockin' Chair Album.' At fourteen, he entered and won a talent contest sponsored by the Beale Street Blues Society in Memphis, launching his professional career while still in high school.[1] By age sixteen, he had already recorded his debut album, 'Call The Cops' (1996), which displayed what music historian Tony Russell described as 'a flawless command of 1950s blues guitar.'[1] His early work on Susan Tedeschi's gold-selling album 'Just Won't Burn' (1998) brought him national exposure and established him as a rising star in the blues community.[1]

Throughout his brief but prolific career, Costello released five critically acclaimed albums that showcased his evolving artistry and refusal to be confined by blues purism.[1][4] His second album, 'Cuttin' In' (2000), earned him a W.C. Handy Award nomination for Best New Artist Debut, while 'Moanin' For Molasses' (2001) drew praise for his ability to mesh blues, R&B, and soul.[1] His self-titled album 'Sean Costello' (2005) marked a significant evolution, blending soul, funk, and rock influences.[2] His final album, 'We Can Get Together' (2008), was widely acclaimed as his best work, earning two Blues Music Award nominations and featuring guitar work described as 'incendiary,' 'searing,' and 'blistering red hot.'[1] Costello's musical journey was profoundly influenced by his relationship with Levon Helm of The Band, who encouraged him to explore beyond traditional blues into country, rock, and other genres.[1]

Costello's career was tragically cut short when he died of an accidental drug overdose on April 15, 2008, one day before his twenty-ninth birthday, in Atlanta.[1][4] Despite his brief thirteen-year career (1995–2008), he left an indelible mark on the blues community as one of the most gifted and innovative young guitarists of his generation.[1] His legacy continues through posthumous releases, including 'Sean's Blues: A Memorial Retrospective' (2009) and 'In the Magic Shop' (2014), and through the Sean Costello Memorial Fund for Bipolar Research, established to honor his memory and support mental health research.[1]

## Fun Facts
- At age fourteen, Costello created a stir in a Memphis guitar shop when an employee recognized his talent and tipped off his father about a Beale Street Blues Society talent contest, which Costello entered and won.[1]
- Costello was a primarily self-taught guitarist who received his first guitar for his ninth birthday after moving to Atlanta with his family.[6]
- Despite his success in traditional blues, Costello faced significant pushback from blues purists who objected to his exploration of soul, funk, rock, and other genres beyond hardcore blues.[4]
- Costello died exactly one day before his twenty-ninth birthday in a shabby motel room in Atlanta, having had numerous concert dates scheduled in the U.S. and abroad running into November 2008.[2][4]
