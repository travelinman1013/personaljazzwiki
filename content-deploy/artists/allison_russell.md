## Biography
Allison Russell is a Canadian singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and activist whose music blends southern gothic, folk, roots, and Americana influences. Born in Montreal to a Grenadian father and a Scottish-Canadian mother, Russell's early life was marked by trauma, including years of abuse and time in foster care. At age 15, she ran away and eventually settled in Vancouver, where she immersed herself in the city's vibrant folk scene, teaching herself guitar and banjo and finding community among other musicians.[1][2][4]

Russell's career began with the Celtic folk band Fear of Drinking, but she rose to prominence as a founding member of Po' Girl, collaborating with Trish Klein and touring internationally. She later formed Birds of Chicago with JT Nero, her musical and life partner, further expanding her reach in the Americana and roots music world. In 2018, Russell joined the acclaimed collective Our Native Daughters, alongside Rhiannon Giddens, Leyla McCalla, and Amythyst Kiah, using music to explore Black women's histories and resilience. Her solo debut, 'Outside Child' (2021), drew critical acclaim for its deeply personal storytelling and was nominated for a Grammy. Her follow-up, 'The Returner' (2023), marked a joyful evolution in her sound and won the Grammy for Best American Roots Performance.[1][3][4]

Russell's music is celebrated for its emotional depth, poetic lyricism, and fusion of folk, jazz, blues, and roots traditions. She is recognized not only for her artistry but also for her activism and advocacy for survivors of trauma. Her legacy includes breaking barriers as a Black roots artist in Canada, receiving multiple Grammy and Juno nominations and awards, and inspiring a new generation of musicians with her courage and creativity.[1][3][6]
