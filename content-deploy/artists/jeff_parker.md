## Biography
Jeff Parker (born April 4, 1967, in Bridgeport, Connecticut) is an American guitarist, composer, and multi-instrumentalist renowned for his genre-defying approach to music. Raised in Hampton, Virginia, Parker began his musical journey with piano before switching to guitar, inspired by his father's encouragement and early lessons from Jon Spencer. He later attended Berklee College of Music, which provided a foundation in jazz and improvisation, and moved to Chicago in 1991, immersing himself in the city's vibrant experimental and jazz scenes.[1][5]

Parker's career is marked by his versatility and innovation, seamlessly blending jazz, electronic, rock, and improvisational styles. He became a core member of the influential post-rock band Tortoise in 1996 and co-founded groups such as Isotope 217 and the Chicago Underground Trio, contributing to what is known as "The Modern Chicago Sound." As a solo artist, Parker has released critically acclaimed albums including 'Like-Coping,' 'The Relatives,' 'Bright Light in Winter,' 'The New Breed,' 'Slight Freedom,' 'Suite for Max Brown,' and 'Forfolks.' His work often explores the interplay between tradition and technology, improvisation and composition, and acoustic and electronic elements.[1][2][3][8]

Parker's legacy is defined by his ability to navigate multiple genres while maintaining a distinct personal voice. He is a member of the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians (AACM) and has collaborated with a wide array of artists, influencing contemporary jazz, experimental, and indie music. His innovative style and dedication to musical exploration have made him a respected figure in modern music, with his albums frequently appearing on best-of lists and earning critical acclaim.[1][2][3][8]
