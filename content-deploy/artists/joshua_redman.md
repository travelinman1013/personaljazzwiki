## Biography
Joshua Redman, born February 1, 1969, in Berkeley, California, is an American jazz saxophonist and composer renowned for his dynamic artistry and innovative approach to jazz. The son of legendary saxophonist Dewey Redman and dancer Renee Shedroff, he was exposed from an early age to a wide array of musical styles, including jazz, classical, rock, soul, and world music, and began playing clarinet at age nine before switching to tenor saxophone a year later. Despite his deep love for music, Redman prioritized academics, graduating summa cum laude from Harvard College in 1991 and earning acceptance to Yale Law School, which he deferred for what he thought would be a brief hiatus.

Redman's move to Brooklyn in 1991 proved pivotal, immersing him in the vibrant New York jazz scene. Within five months, he won the prestigious Thelonious Monk International Saxophone Competition, launching his professional career. He quickly began performing and recording with jazz luminaries such as Jack DeJohnette, Charlie Haden, Elvin Jones, Joe Lovano, Pat Metheny, and his father Dewey Redman. His self-titled debut album was released in 1993, followed by the acclaimed 'Wish' and 'MoodSwing,' the latter introducing his first permanent band with Brad Mehldau, Christian McBride, and Brian Blade. Redman has since released nearly two dozen albums, led influential ensembles like the SFJAZZ Collective, and contributed to film and educational projects, solidifying his reputation as one of the most important jazz musicians of his generation.

Redman's musical style is marked by a blend of tradition and innovation, drawing on influences from jazz greats such as John Coltrane, Ornette Coleman, and Cannonball Adderley, as well as artists from other genres like The Beatles and Prince. His legacy includes not only his own recordings and performances but also his role in nurturing new talent and expanding the boundaries of contemporary jazz.
