## Biography
The Smashing Pumpkins are an American alternative rock band formed in 1988 in Chicago, Illinois, by Billy Corgan (vocals, guitar) and James Iha (guitar).[1][3] The classic lineup was completed with bassist D'Arcy Wretzky and drummer Jimmy Chamberlin, who joined shortly after the band's inception.[1][2][3] Corgan, the son of a professional musician, envisioned the band as a post-punk project drawing inspiration from goth and new wave acts like The Cure and Siouxsie and the Banshees.[1] The band's sound synthesized progressive rock, grunge, and psychedelia with the brooding atmospherics of goth rock and the melodic sensibilities of dream pop bands such as the Cocteau Twins.[3] After early performances at local Chicago venues and initial recordings with Sub Pop Records, the band achieved mainstream breakthrough with their 1993 second album Siamese Dream, followed by the massively successful 1995 double album Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200.[2] Their 1998 album Adore peaked at number two, solidifying their status as one of the most popular and influential alternative rock groups of the 1990s.[2][3]

The band initially disbanded in 2000, after which members pursued solo projects and other ventures.[1] Billy Corgan led the post-grunge band Zwan (2001-2003), while guitarist James Iha joined A Perfect Circle in 2003 and pursued solo work.[1] The Smashing Pumpkins reunited in 2007 with Corgan and Chamberlin, releasing the album Zeitgeist with new guitarist Jeff Schroeder, though the reunion initially excluded original bassist D'Arcy Wretzky.[1][2] Following years of sporadic activity and various lineup configurations, Chamberlin and Iha officially rejoined the band in February 2018, marking the first time since the 1990s that the core trio recorded together.[2] This reunited lineup has released four albums: Shiny and Oh So Bright, Vol. 1: No Past. No Future. No Sun. (2018), Cyr (2020), ATUM (2023), and Aghori Mhori Mei (2023), demonstrating the band's continued evolution while blending electronic elements with their alternative rock roots.[1][2]

Despite significant lineup changes and a volatile history, Billy Corgan has remained the band's core driving force throughout their career.[1] The Smashing Pumpkins' legacy encompasses their pioneering role in 1990s alternative rock, their perfectionist approach to songwriting and production, and their willingness to evolve musically across decades. Their recent work, particularly Aghori Mhori Mei, has been well-received for returning to the heavy guitars and drums characteristic of their 1990s origins.[2]

## Fun Facts
- Billy Corgan's perfectionism was evident early in the band's career—when he learned that Sub Pop Records would not allow another band on the label (Afghan Wigs) creative control over their album cover, he rejected Sub Pop's offer and sent demo tapes to other labels, ultimately securing a better deal.[5]
- The song 'Today' became a breakthrough moment for the band during the recording of their second album; when Billy Corgan played a demo of the song (which he wrote during a period of desperation) to producer Butch Vig and record label executives, they were so impressed that it helped secure the band's future.[5]
- The band's early success was built on word-of-mouth in Chicago's local music scene—they grew from performing in front of 50 people with a drum machine to selling out venues holding 800 people within six months of Jimmy Chamberlin joining.[5]
- Billy Corgan described the band's early musical style as 'geeky, gloomy, art rock,' reflecting their post-punk origins before they evolved into the alternative rock powerhouse of the 1990s.[5]
