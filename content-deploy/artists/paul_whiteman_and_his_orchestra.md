## Biography
Paul Whiteman, born March 28, 1890, in Denver, Colorado, was raised in a musical family—his father was a music supervisor and his mother an opera singer[8][6]. He began his career as a violinist and violist, earning a position in the Denver Symphony Orchestra before joining the San Francisco Symphony in 1914[2][4]. After serving as a bandleader for a U.S. Navy orchestra during World War I, Whiteman founded his own orchestra in California in 1918, quickly rising to prominence on the jazz scene[1][3].

Whiteman's orchestra moved to New York City in 1920, where their recordings for the Victor Talking Machine Company brought national fame[2][4][7]. He became known for blending symphonic and popular music with jazz, making the genre accessible to mainstream audiences. Whiteman's arrangements often simplified jazz rhythms and limited improvisation, but his bands were large and featured top musicians, setting a new standard for orchestral jazz[3][4]. His most famous achievement was commissioning George Gershwin's 'Rhapsody in Blue' in 1924, premiering it with Gershwin as soloist—a landmark event that defined his orchestra's legacy[1][2][3].

Throughout his career, Whiteman hired and promoted many future stars, including Bing Crosby, Bix Beiderbecke, and Mildred Bailey, and produced over 600 recordings[2][5]. He was dubbed the 'King of Jazz' and, despite criticism for his orchestral approach, played a pivotal role in popularizing jazz and big band music in America. Whiteman remained influential for over three decades, shaping the careers of countless musicians and leaving an indelible mark on American music[1][2][5].

## Fun Facts
- Whiteman was dubbed the 'King of Jazz' by the press, though his style was more symphonic and less improvisational than traditional jazz[9][3].
- His orchestra's recording of 'Whispering' sold over two and a half million copies, making it one of the first major jazz hits[7].
- Whiteman formed Paul Whiteman, Inc., which managed up to 58 satellite dance bands performing under his name[7].
- He provided music for six Broadway shows and produced more than 600 phonograph recordings during his career[2].
