## Biography
Serenity Stewart is a contemporary jazz vocalist and recording artist known for her sultry interpretations of standards from the Great American Songbook. Classically trained as a soprano, she began her musical journey at age eight, first performing in church before developing a deep love for vintage jazz and swing music. Growing up, while other children listened to rock-and-roll, Stewart spent her childhood playing dress-up in her mother's clothes and singing along to old records, cultivating an early appreciation for the melodies and timeless themes of classic jazz standards.

Stewart's path to pursuing music professionally came after a life-altering experience in July 2004, when she suffered a brain aneurysm. This medical crisis put her priorities into perspective and prompted her to leave her mainstream career to pursue her dream of bringing quality music to audiences. Prior to this turning point, she had been balancing long hours at an office job while raising four children as a single parent, with music serving as her coping mechanism during times of stress and adversity. Her debut album, "P.S. I Love You," was recorded in Las Vegas and features a compilation of jazz standards that showcase her powerful vocal interpretations.

Today, Stewart performs both as a solo jazz artist with a Vegas-style show band and leads Serenity Brings The Storm (SBTS), a dynamic band that performs classic rock and country music from the 70s, 80s, and 90s. She is described as having a personality as big as her sound, with performances that are both entertaining and memorable, often compared to Jessica Rabbit for her glamorous, pin-up style presentation. In addition to her musical career, Stewart is an award-winning actress who has performed on both stage and screen, continuing to introduce contemporary audiences to enduring jazz classics through her iconic performances at clubs and private events.

## Fun Facts
- Stewart rehearses music she plans to record for 3-4 hours daily and spends breaks shopping for new gowns and jewelry at vintage shops to maintain her glamorous pin-up aesthetic.
- Her band Serenity Brings The Storm came together after familiar musicians called her asking if she'd be interested in exploring Classic Rock and Country music, leading to a year of rehearsals before launching the project.
- Stewart has performed in both Cabo and Puerto Vallarta, and her travels to these locations helped solidify her decision to pursue music full-time after her 2004 brain aneurysm.
- She has been nicknamed the 'Jessica Rabbit of Jazz' and presents a show called 'The Golden Age of Jazz & Legendary Ladies' that covers music from artists like Sinatra, Etta James, Cher, Diana Ross, and Dolly Parton.
