## Biography
Kirk Fletcher is an American blues guitarist, singer, songwriter, and producer, widely regarded as one of the leading modern blues players of his generation.[1][4][6] Born and raised in Bellflower, California, he grew up in a Compton church where his father was a pastor, and first picked up the guitar around age eight to play alongside his much older brother Walter in church services.[1][2][8] Those early years immersed him in gospel and soul as well as a broad range of styles that Walter shared with him—from Jimi Hendrix to Steely Dan—laying the foundation for his lifelong focus on great tone, dynamics, and deeply expressive playing.[1][2] Through high school he played in the jazz band, then fell into the Southern California blues scene, making a key connection at a local guitar shop with Jeff Rivera, Robben Ford’s guitar tech, which opened his ears further to sophisticated blues and jazz-inflected guitar work.[2][3]

In the mid‑1990s Fletcher gravitated toward traditional West Coast blues through singer and harmonica player Al Blake, who introduced him to figures such as Junior Watson and Lynwood Slim.[2] These connections led to his first professional blues gigs and, eventually, his debut album *I’m Here and I’m Gone* for JSP Records, marking him as a serious young blues voice.[2] Blake also connected him with Kim Wilson, which in turn led to a role in Kim Wilson’s Blues Revue and then several years as lead guitarist with The Fabulous Thunderbirds, including recording on Wilson’s Grammy‑nominated *Smokin’ Joint* (2001) and the Thunderbirds’ album *Painted On*.[1][2][4] Alongside extensive session and sideman work for artists ranging from Cyndi Lauper and Michelle Branch to Italian star Eros Ramazzotti, Fletcher steadily developed his own solo career, releasing studio and live albums that culminated in chart and award recognition: his album *Hold On* reached the Top 15 of the Billboard Top Blues Albums chart and was nominated for Best Contemporary Blues Album at the 2019 Blues Music Awards, followed by the critically praised *My Blues Pathway* and his Muscle Shoals–recorded *Heartache By The Pound*.[1][2]

Musically, Fletcher blends the language of classic electric blues—deeply indebted to B.B. King, Albert King, Albert Collins, and Texas and West Coast traditions—with gospel roots, R&B, and soul, resulting in a style often described as both authentically old-school and refreshingly modern.[1][2][3] He is known for his singing vibrato, vocal-like phrasing, and a focus on feel and tone rather than flash, something he often attributes to lessons absorbed from church, from his brother, and from studying his heroes’ recordings in depth.[1][2][3] A multiple Blues Music Award nominee and a 2015 British Blues Award nominee, Fletcher has become a respected bandleader and accompanist on the international blues circuit, frequently cited in the guitar community as a model of tasteful, deeply musical blues playing that keeps the tradition alive while speaking to contemporary audiences.[1][2][4][6]

## Fun Facts
- Fletcher’s first serious stage experiences were in his father’s Compton church, where he regularly played electric guitar for services into his early twenties, effectively treating the church as his first bandstand.[1][2]
- A chance friendship in a Southern California guitar shop with Jeff Rivera, Robben Ford’s guitar tech, became a turning point that deepened his exposure to high-level blues and jazz guitar and helped steer him into the professional scene.[2]
- One of his early career highlights was performing at Antone’s 25th Anniversary celebration, where he shared the stage with blues icons Pinetop Perkins, James Cotton, and Hubert Sumlin—heroes he had grown up admiring.[2]
- During the COVID‑19 pandemic, while living in Switzerland, Fletcher spent significant time crate‑digging for European pressings of classic blues and soul records, listening deeply and writing much of the material that became his album *Heartache By The Pound*.[1]
