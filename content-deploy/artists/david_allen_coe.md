## Biography
David Allan Coe was born on September 6, 1939, in Akron, Ohio, and experienced a troubled early life marked by rebellion, spending much of his youth from age 9 in reform schools and correctional facilities, followed by prison terms in his 20s for crimes like burglary and auto theft, including time at Ohio State Penitentiary and Marion Correctional Institution until his release in 1967[1][2][3][4]. After prison, Coe moved to Nashville, living in a hearse parked near the Ryman Auditorium while busking and pursuing music, influenced by blues and R&B; he signed with Plantation Records (owned by Shelby Singleton) and released his debut album Penitentiary Blues in 1969 or 1970, drawing from his incarceration experiences[1][2][4][5]. His songwriting talent shone when 'Would You Lay With Me (In a Field of Stone)' became a #1 hit for Tanya Tucker in 1974, leading to a Columbia Records deal and his critically acclaimed album The Mysterious Rhinestone Cowboy that same year[2][4][5].

Coe became a central figure in the 1970s outlaw country movement, distinguished by his rebellious persona, long hair, tattoos, Outlaws motorcycle club membership, and outrageous stage antics like performing in a mask as the 'Mysterious Rhinestone Cowboy' or riding a Harley onstage, blending honky-tonk, blues, and country with throaty baritone vocals, profane lyrics, and themes of drugs and sex[1][2][3][4]. His style evolved from bluesy roots to pure outlaw country, earning him the title 'outlaw's outlaw' while alienating mainstream Nashville, though he continued releasing albums, touring with acts like Grand Funk Railroad, and maintaining a cult following[3][4][5].

Coe's legacy endures as a charismatic, controversial icon of outlaw country, a road warrior into the 1990s and beyond with periodic releases on small labels, live performances featuring bandmates like his son Tyler and Warren Hayes, and influence on alternative country despite legal and personal setbacks[2][4][5][6].
