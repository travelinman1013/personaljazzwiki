## Biography
Frank Wellington Wess was born on January 4, 1922, in Kansas City, Missouri, into a middle-class African-American family of schoolteachers. He began playing alto saxophone at age 10 in his father's amateur band in Sapulpa, Oklahoma, after the family moved there in 1932, and further honed his skills after settling in Washington, D.C., in 1935, performing with local dance groups and the Howard Theatre house band. Despite parental expectations for him to become a dentist, Wess pursued jazz, switching to classical training and later studying flute seriously under Wallace Mann of the National Symphony Orchestra at the Modern School of Music in 1949 via the GI Bill, earning a degree. His early career included U.S. Army Band service from 1941-1945 in Africa, leading a group for Josephine Baker, and joining Billy Eckstine's pioneering bebop orchestra in 1945 alongside Miles Davis, Dexter Gordon, and Art Blakey.[1][2][3]
