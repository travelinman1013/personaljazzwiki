## Biography
Clark Terry was born in 1920 in St. Louis, Missouri, and became one of the most prolific and influential jazz musicians of the 20th century, with a career spanning over 70 years.[1][2] After taking up the valve trombone in high school due to a trumpet shortage, Terry formed his own jazz quartet called the Vashon High Swingsters to circumvent his school principal's ban on jazz.[1] Following his discharge from the Navy in 1945, where he served in the U.S. Navy band during World War II, Terry rapidly ascended through the ranks of jazz, playing with bandleaders including Lionel Hampton, Charlie Barnet, Eddie "Cleanhead" Vinson, and George Hudson.[1][2][4] His breakthrough came in 1948 when he joined Count Basie's band, where he remained until 1951, establishing himself as a technically gifted and versatile musician capable of adapting across multiple jazz subgenres.[2][3]

Terry's prominence reached new heights when Duke Ellington recruited him in 1951, and he remained with Ellington's orchestra for eight years as a featured soloist, playing his first gig with the band on Armistice Day, 1951, at Kiel Auditorium in St. Louis.[1][3] During the 1960s, he became the first Black musician on the NBC payroll, serving as a staff musician and member of The Tonight Show's house band for 12 years while continuing to perform in nightclubs and record with numerous artists.[1][2] A pioneer of the flugelhorn as a solo jazz instrument, Terry's exuberant, swinging horn playing influenced generations of musicians including Miles Davis and Quincy Jones.[2][4][7] From the 1970s onward, he led his own ensembles, including the Big Bad Band and Clark Terry's Young Titans, while becoming deeply committed to jazz education through organizing camps, clinics, and the Jazz Mobile in Harlem.[1][2][5]

Terry's legacy encompasses more than 900 recordings, over 200 compositions, and recognition as a consummate musician and engaging entertainer who could alternate between trumpet and flugelhorn in solo duels with himself.[1][2][4] He received numerous honors including a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2010, doctorates from Berklee College of Music and the University of New Hampshire, and designation as an NEA Jazz Master.[2][3] He was appointed a musical ambassador by the U.S. Department of State and performed for eight U.S. Presidents, appearing in more than fifty jazz festivals across six continents.[1][5] Terry died on February 21, 2015, leaving behind an unparalleled contribution to jazz history.

## Fun Facts
- Terry formed his own jazz quartet called the Vashon High Swingsters while in high school to circumvent his school principal's ban on jazz music, demonstrating his early entrepreneurial spirit and commitment to the genre.[1]
- Terry pioneered the flugelhorn as a solo jazz instrument; when he first brought the instrument to one of Duke Ellington's rehearsals, Ellington immediately embraced it, leading to its prominent use in jazz.[7]
- Terry became famous for his humorous 'duets' with himself, sometimes playing more than one instrument simultaneously in solo performances, and his scat-sung composition 'Mumbles' became a signature piece that exposed his entertaining side.[2]
- Despite initially rebuffing a young Miles Davis early in his career, Terry later sought redemption by becoming one of the earliest active jazz musicians to take time off from performing to dedicate himself to teaching and mentoring the next generation.[1]
