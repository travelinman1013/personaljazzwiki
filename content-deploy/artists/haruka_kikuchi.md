## Biography
Haruka Kikuchi is a Japanese trombonist renowned for her dynamic presence in the New Orleans traditional jazz scene. Born in Ibaraki Prefecture and raised in Chiba Prefecture, Japan, she was immersed in music from an early age, excelling in piano and violin before discovering her passion for jazz trombone at age 15 after hearing a recording by the Original Dixieland Jass Band. Inspired by the tailgate trombone style of Eddie Edwards, she formed a Dixieland band in high school and later graduated from Tokyo University of the Arts in 2010 with a degree in music science.

Driven by a deep love for New Orleans jazz, Kikuchi relocated to New Orleans in 2014, where she quickly became a fixture in the city’s vibrant music community. She has performed with prominent groups such as Kermit Ruffins’ band, Marla Dixon’s Shotgun Jazz Band, The Swamp Donkeys, the all-female Shake ’Em Up Jazz Band, and the Audacity Brass Band. Her energetic and authentic approach to traditional jazz trombone has earned her acclaim as one of the world’s leading practitioners of the style, with critics dubbing her the 'Queen of the Tailgate Trombone.' Kikuchi continues to honor and advance the legacy of New Orleans jazz through both her performances and collaborations, bridging cultures and generations through her artistry.
