## Biography
Jimmy Smith (born December 8, 1928, in Norristown, Pennsylvania; died February 8, 2005, in Scottsdale, Arizona) was a pioneering American jazz musician who revolutionized the use of the Hammond B-3 organ in jazz. Raised in a musical family—his mother played church organ and his father was a tap dancer—Smith began performing as a child and won a local radio contest as a boogie-woogie pianist at age nine. After serving in the Navy and studying music in Philadelphia, he was inspired by organist Wild Bill Davis to devote himself to the Hammond organ, practicing intensively before debuting his new sound.

Smith's innovative approach transformed the organ from a novelty instrument into a central force in jazz, particularly through his virtuosic single-note lines, gospel harmonies, and blues-infused phrasing. His 1950s and 1960s recordings for Blue Note and Verve, including albums like 'A New Sound, A New Star' and 'The Sermon!', established him as the leading figure in soul jazz and hard bop. Smith's trios, often featuring guitar and drums, set the template for jazz organ groups, and his energetic, swinging style influenced generations of musicians.

Throughout his career, Smith collaborated with major jazz artists and crossed over into popular music, notably contributing to Michael Jackson's 'Bad.' He received numerous accolades, including the NEA Jazz Masters Award in 2005, and is widely credited with legitimizing the organ as a jazz instrument, leaving a lasting legacy on jazz, funk, and blues.
