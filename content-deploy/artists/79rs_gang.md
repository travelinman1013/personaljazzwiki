## Biography
79rs Gang is a New Orleans-based music group formed in 2013 by two prominent Mardi Gras Indian chiefs: Big Chief Romeo Bougere of the 9th Ward Hunters and Big Chief Jermaine Bossier of the 7th Ward Creole Hunters. Both men come from deep-rooted Black Masking and musical families—Bougere began masking at age 4 under the guidance of his father, Rudy Bougere, founder and Big Chief of the 9th Ward Hunters, while Bossier, grandson of New Orleans R&B figure Raymond Lewis, started masking at 14 and grew up singing in church. Their partnership was significant, as it bridged a historic rivalry between their respective tribes, symbolizing reconciliation and unity within the Mardi Gras Indian community[1][2][4].

The group debuted with the album 'Fire on the Bayou' in 2014, which showcased traditional Mardi Gras Indian music with dense percussion and chant vocals. Their follow-up, 'Expect the Unexpected' (2020), marked a bold evolution, blending the roots of Black Masking Carnival music with hip-hop, electronic elements, and funk, thanks in part to producer Eric Heigle. This innovative approach brought the storied Mardi Gras Indian tradition to new audiences, infusing it with contemporary dance and pop sensibilities while retaining its cultural authenticity. 79rs Gang is widely regarded as one of the most important ambassadors of Mardi Gras Indian music since the Wild Magnolias in the 1970s, pushing the genre forward while honoring its past[1][2][3][4].

Their music is celebrated for its energetic fusion of parade chants, drumlines, and modern production, making it both a preservation and a reinvention of a celebrated but historically guarded New Orleans tradition. Performing live as an eight-piece band, 79rs Gang continues to inspire with their commitment to storytelling, innovation, and cultural pride[1][4].
