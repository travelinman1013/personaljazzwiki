## Biography
Michael Parrish & Pinetop Perkins formed a unique intergenerational partnership that bridged the worlds of classic Mississippi blues and contemporary American roots music. Pinetop Perkins, born Willie Perkins in 1913 in Belzoni, Mississippi, was a legendary blues pianist, widely regarded as one of the last great Mississippi bluesmen. He began his career in the late 1920s, developing a distinctive boogie-woogie piano style that influenced generations of musicians. After years as a sideman with icons like Sonny Boy Williamson and Muddy Waters, Perkins became a solo artist and continued to tour and record into his nineties[1][6].

Michael Parrish, a Bay Area native turned New York-based musician, came from a background that blended blues, rock, and improvisational music. After early experiences in Chicago and touring with Guitar Gabriel, Parrish developed his own sound before forming the Michael Parrish Band. His meeting with Pinetop Perkins led to the collaborative album 'One Heart' (1999), a collection of piano duets recorded on two Steinway grand pianos. The album, inspired by the boogie-woogie duets of the 1930s, showcased the interplay between Parrish's modern sensibility and Perkins' deep blues tradition, earning acclaim for its lively originals and classic covers[2][4][7].

Their collaboration stands as a testament to the enduring vitality of blues piano, with 'One Heart' celebrated for its energetic improvisation and mutual respect between two artists from different generations. While Perkins' legacy is firmly established as a foundational figure in blues history, Parrish has continued to build his reputation as an accomplished pianist and bandleader, drawing from his experiences with legends like Perkins to inform his own evolving style.
