## Biography
Frankie Ford, born Vincent Francis Guzzo, Jr. on August 4, 1939, in Gretna, Louisiana, was the adopted son of Vincent and Anna Guzzo. He displayed early talent in singing and dancing, performing on stage from age five, winning vocal competitions, and appearing on the Ted Mack Amateur Hour in 1952. In high school, he joined the Syncopators as a singer and pianist, blending doo-wop and rockabilly styles influenced by New Orleans R&B.[1][2]

Spotted by manager Joe Caronna, Ford signed with Ace Records under Johnny Vincent in 1958, releasing 'Cheatin' Woman' as a regional hit. His breakthrough came with 'Sea Cruise' in 1959, a vocal overdub on Huey 'Piano' Smith's instrumental track, which topped charts at No. 14 pop and No. 11 R&B, selling over a million copies for gold status. Despite follow-ups like 'Alimony' and 'Time After Time' charting modestly, Ford moved to Imperial Records, worked with producer Dave Bartholomew, and covered hits like 'Seventeen.' Drafted in 1962, he entertained troops in Asia before returning to club performances in New Orleans.[1][2]

Ford sustained a career through the decades, appearing in the 1978 film American Hot Wax, releasing albums like New Orleans Dynamo (1984), and co-owning Briarmeade Records. He headlined festivals including New Orleans Jazz & Heritage and closed Gretna Heritage Festival annually. Inducted into the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame in 2010 and West Bank Musicians Hall of Fame in 2003, Ford died on September 28, 2015, in Gretna at age 76 after a long illness, leaving a legacy in rock and roll and R&B.[1][2][4]
