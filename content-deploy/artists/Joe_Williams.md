## Biography
Joe Williams, born Joseph Goreed on December 12, 1918, in Cordele, Georgia, moved to Chicago with his family at a young age. Immersed in Chicago's vibrant music scene, he was influenced early by the gospel traditions of his church and the jazz and blues acts that flourished on the South Side. Williams formed a gospel quartet, The Jubilee Boys, in his teens and soon began singing professionally in local clubs, dropping out of school at sixteen to pursue music full-time. By the late 1930s, he was performing with bands led by Jimmie Noone and Les Hite, and in the early 1940s, he briefly sang with Lionel Hampton’s orchestra.

Williams' major breakthrough came in 1954 when he joined the Count Basie Orchestra as its featured vocalist. His smooth, versatile baritone and command of blues and jazz standards quickly made him a star, with signature recordings like “Every Day I Have the Blues” and “Alright, Okay, You Win” earning national acclaim. Williams remained with Basie until 1961, after which he launched a successful solo career, performing at major festivals, clubs, and on television, and collaborating with jazz luminaries such as Harry Edison, George Shearing, and Cannonball Adderley. His artistry was recognized with a Grammy Award in 1984 and induction into the Grammy Hall of Fame for his 1955 recording of “Every Day I Have the Blues.”

Williams’ musical style blended jazz, blues, and swing, characterized by his rich baritone, impeccable phrasing, and emotive delivery. He is widely regarded as one of the quintessential male jazz vocalists, leaving a legacy that influenced generations of singers and helped define the sound of mid-century big band jazz.
