## Biography
Jeffrey Marshall Foxworthy was born on September 6, 1958, in Hapeville, Georgia, near Atlanta. Growing up in the Atlanta area, he developed an early interest in comedy, saving his allowance to buy comedy records, memorizing them, and performing bits for schoolmates. After studying computer technology at Georgia Tech, he followed his father into a job at IBM as a technician, working there for five years before quitting in the mid-1980s to pursue comedy full-time. His break came in 1984 when he won the Great Southeastern Laugh-Off contest at an Atlanta comedy club after being dared by coworkers, leading him to perform 500 shows over the next eight years at open mics and on the road.[1][2][3][5]

## Fun Facts
- Foxworthy quit his IBM job just a few months after winning his first comedy contest, despite his mother's doubts, to pursue stand-up full-time.
- A heckler once called him a redneck, inspiring him to create his famous 'You might be a redneck if...' one-liners on the spot, leading to his breakthrough material.
- His debut album 'You Might Be a Redneck If…' (1993) was certified triple platinum and topped the comedy albums chart.
- He hosted radio's 'The Foxworthy Countdown' from 1999 to 2009, featuring top country hits, and earned a CMA nomination for Broadcast Personality of the Year in 2001.
