## Biography
Ivan Neville, born in 1959 in New Orleans, Louisiana, is a renowned multi-instrumentalist, singer, and songwriter, and the son of legendary soul singer Aaron Neville. Growing up in the heart of a deeply musical family, Ivan was immersed in the rich traditions of New Orleans music from a young age, joining his father and uncles in the Neville Brothers as a teenager and serving as their third keyboardist. His early exposure to the vibrant local scene and the legacy of his family shaped his musical identity, blending elements of classic soul, funk, and rhythm and blues.

Neville's career quickly expanded beyond his family band. He became a sought-after studio and touring musician, collaborating with a diverse array of artists including Bonnie Raitt, the Rolling Stones, Don Henley, Paula Abdul, and Keith Richards, with whom he toured as a member of the X-Pensive Winos. His solo career began with the release of 'If My Ancestors Could See Me Now' in 1988, featuring the Top 30 Billboard hit 'Not Just Another Girl' and the duet 'Falling Out of Love' with Bonnie Raitt. Ivan also contributed to the soundtracks of major films and was a member of the Spin Doctors, assuming lead vocal duties during tours and recordings.

In the early 2000s, Ivan and his cousin Ian Neville formed Dumpstaphunk, a powerhouse funk band that has become a staple of the New Orleans music scene and festival circuit. Ivan's musical style is characterized by soulful vocals, intricate keyboard work, and a deep groove rooted in the traditions of his hometown. His legacy is marked by his commitment to carrying forward the New Orleans musical torch, his prolific collaborations, and his role in mentoring and inspiring new generations of musicians.
