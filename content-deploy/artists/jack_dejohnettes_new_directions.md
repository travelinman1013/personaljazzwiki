## Biography
Jack DeJohnette's New Directions was a pioneering jazz supergroup formed in 1978 by drummer and pianist Jack DeJohnette, one of the most influential figures in modern jazz. Born in Chicago in 1942, DeJohnette had already established himself through collaborations with legends such as Miles Davis, Keith Jarrett, and Charles Lloyd before forming New Directions. The group was conceived as a synthesis of DeJohnette's diverse musical experiences, bringing together musicians from different backgrounds to explore new sonic territories.

The original lineup featured trumpeter Lester Bowie (of the Art Ensemble of Chicago), guitarist John Abercrombie (known for his work with ECM and the Gateway trio), and bassist Eddie Gómez (renowned for his tenure with the Bill Evans Trio). Their 1978 self-titled album, recorded in Oslo and released on ECM, showcased a blend of free jazz, jazz fusion, and ambient jazz, characterized by spacious improvisations and a dreamlike quality. The band's chemistry and experimental approach earned critical acclaim, including France’s Prix du Jazz Contemporain de L’Academie Charles Cros, and the album remains a favorite among DeJohnette's ECM recordings.

New Directions was notable for its ability to merge the avant-garde with lyrical sensibilities, reflecting DeJohnette's vision of uniting 'unlikely characters' to create music that was both challenging and accessible. Though the group was relatively short-lived, its influence on the jazz fusion and free jazz scenes was significant, and it stands as a testament to DeJohnette's role as a connector and innovator in the jazz world.
