## Biography
George Lewis (born George Joseph François Louis Zenon on July 13, 1900, in the French Quarter of New Orleans) was a self-taught clarinetist who became a central figure in the revival and preservation of traditional New Orleans jazz. Growing up in a working-class family with Native American heritage on his father's side, Lewis began his musical journey playing a tin fife before moving to the clarinet, performing professionally with the Black Eagle Band of Mandeville in his teens. He was deeply influenced by the local brass band tradition and the vibrant musical community of New Orleans, joining bands led by Buddy Petit and Earl Humphrey early in his career[2].

Lewis's career developed through collaborations with nearly every major New Orleans jazz musician of his era, including Chris Kelly, Kid Rena, the Eureka Brass Band, and the Olympia Orchestra. The 1930s saw him working with Bunk Johnson, De De Pierce, and Billie Pierce, and his recordings with Johnson in the early 1940s helped spark a global revival of interest in traditional jazz[1][3]. After Johnson's retirement, Lewis led his own band, which became renowned for its authentic New Orleans sound and toured internationally, influencing jazz scenes in the UK, Denmark, and Japan. His signature piece, "Burgundy Street Blues," emerged from informal recording sessions at his home during a period of convalescence following a serious injury[2].

Lewis's musical style was characterized by a rich, expressive tone, rhythmic arpeggios, and inventive melodic phrasing, which critics described as deeply affecting despite limited technical virtuosity[1][3]. He played a pivotal role in the New Orleans jazz revival, performing regularly at Preservation Hall in the 1960s and mentoring younger musicians. His legacy endures through his recordings, international influence, and the many artists he inspired, making him one of the most widely imitated figures in traditional jazz[3].
