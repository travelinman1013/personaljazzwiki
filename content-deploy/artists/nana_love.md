## Biography
Nana Love is a Ghanaian singer and songwriter best known for her rare, cult 1970s Afro‑funk and soul recordings, which have since become prized by collectors and reissue labels.[3][4] Active during Ghana’s vibrant post‑highlife era, she worked with producer Reindorf Oppong and a studio band of local musicians to create lush, horn‑driven arrangements that fused West African rhythms with American funk, soul and jazz harmonies.[3] Although detailed public information about her early life, training and personal background is scarce, her recordings situate her within the generation of Ghanaian artists who absorbed global soul and funk influences while remaining rooted in local dance‑band and highlife traditions.[3][4]

Her best‑known work, reissued by specialist labels such as BBE Music, showcases a confident lead vocalist fronting sophisticated arrangements, with extended grooves, string and horn sections, and prominent electric keys and guitars.[3] These tracks place her alongside other African female bandleaders of the 1970s who challenged male‑dominated studio cultures by taking the principal creative role as singer‑songwriters. Though her original releases circulated mostly within West Africa and among diaspora communities at the time, they largely disappeared from public view until crate‑diggers and DJs in Europe and North America began rediscovering and playing her music in the 2000s.[3][4]

Through these reissues and radio features, Nana Love has gained a second life as a touchstone of vintage Afro‑soul and Afro‑funk. Contemporary listeners and selectors now hear her work alongside artists like Ebo Taylor and other Ghanaian funk innovators, and her recordings are frequently programmed on specialist platforms such as NTS Radio, cementing her legacy as a cult but important figure in the story of 1970s Ghanaian popular music.[3][4]
