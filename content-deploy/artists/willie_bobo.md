## Biography
Willie Bobo, born William Correa on February 28, 1934, in Spanish Harlem, New York City, was a pioneering Latin jazz percussionist of Puerto Rican descent. Growing up in a musically rich environment—his father played the cuatro—Bobo taught himself bongos as a teenager and soon expanded to congas, timbales, and drums. By age 12, he was already performing professionally as a dancer, and by 14, he was playing bongos with established acts, quickly immersing himself in the vibrant New York Latin jazz scene.[2][3][6]

Bobo's early career was shaped by his work as a band boy for Machito's Afro-Cubans, where he occasionally filled in on percussion and gained invaluable experience. He studied under the legendary Mongo Santamaria, serving as his translator and student, and joined Tito Puente's orchestra at 19 for a four-year tenure. The jazz pianist Mary Lou Williams gave him the nickname 'Bobo' during a recording session in the early 1950s. Bobo's career flourished as he collaborated with George Shearing, Cal Tjader, and Herbie Mann, and he recorded the classic 'Afro-Blue' with Santamaria. In the mid-1960s, he led his own groups, achieving crossover success with albums that blended Latin rhythms with pop, jazz, and R&B, most notably on Verve Records with hits like 'Spanish Grease.'[1][2][5]

Relocating to Los Angeles in 1969, Bobo became a sought-after session musician, working with artists such as Miles Davis, Cannonball Adderley, and Carlos Santana. He also appeared on television, including Bill Cosby's shows, and led his own combos until his death from cancer in 1983. Bobo's innovative fusion of Latin, jazz, and funk left a lasting legacy, influencing generations of percussionists and helping to popularize Latin jazz in mainstream music.[1][2][4]
