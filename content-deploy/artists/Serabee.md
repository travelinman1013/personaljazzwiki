## Biography
Serabee, born Sarah L. Buras, is an American singer-songwriter and pianist whose roots trace deep into the musical traditions of Louisiana and Mississippi. Raised amidst churches, juke joints, and tent revivals by her preacher, guitar-playing father and folk songwriter mother, Serabee was immersed in a rich blend of gospel, blues, and folk from an early age[1][3][4]. Her formative years were spent performing in New Orleans and Mississippi clubs, quickly earning her a devoted local following and honing her dynamic, soulful stage presence.

Her career took off when she signed her first major label deal at age 22 with DreamWorks, under the guidance of Lenny Waronker and producer Gary Katz (Steely Dan)[3]. Serabee's songwriting prowess was cemented when she penned "Crazy Chick," a number one hit for Charlotte Church in 2009, which brought her international recognition and opportunities to travel the world[3]. Despite subsequent deals with Sony and Universal, she faced industry setbacks, including a difficult stint on the reality show 'The Voice,' which she described as creatively stifling[2]. Disillusioned with major labels, Serabee returned to her hometown of Kiln, Mississippi, and began recording independently, notably with Rabadash Records, releasing albums such as 2022's 'Hummingbird Tea'[2][3].

Serabee's musical style is a vibrant fusion of southern soul, blues, gospel, and pop, drawing comparisons to Ray Charles, Professor Longhair, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Dr. John[1][3]. Her powerful, emotive vocals have been likened to Aretha Franklin, Tina Turner, and Susan Tedeschi[1][3]. Known for her 'bring the house down' performances and authentic songwriting, Serabee has become a respected figure in the Gulf Coast music scene, celebrated for her ability to blend tradition with innovation and for her resilience in forging an independent artistic path.

## Fun Facts
- Serabee's song 'Water Under The Bridge' was praised by country legend George Jones, who wanted to record a duet with her before his passing[1].
- She was awarded 'Best New Artist' by Making a Scene in 2023[1].
- Her musical upbringing included performing in tent revivals and juke joints, blending gospel and blues from childhood[1][3].
- She has performed at Morgan Freeman's Ground Zero Blues Club in Biloxi and regularly headlines New Orleans venues[2].
