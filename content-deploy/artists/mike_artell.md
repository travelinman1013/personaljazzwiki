## Biography
Mike Artell is an American author, illustrator, cartoonist, musician, and professional speaker best known for his humorous and Cajun-flavored children’s books. Born in 1948, he graduated from Southeastern Louisiana University in 1972 with a B.A. in Marketing before spending about 15 years in sales and marketing, working largely with technology-based companies and consulting for firms such as Texas Instruments.[1][5] During this period he gained extensive experience in customer service, training, and high-tech markets including real-time data acquisition, artificial intelligence systems, and oil and gas exploration, skills that later informed his engaging, instructional style as a writer and presenter.[1]  

In 1987 Artell shifted careers to become a freelance writer, illustrator, and cartoonist, eventually hosting his own television show on WWL-TV, the CBS affiliate in New Orleans, where his weekly program drew more than 50,000 viewers and topped its time slot.[1][4] He has since written and/or illustrated over 35–50 books for children, ranging from how‑to‑draw guides and activity titles to picture books and retellings of classic tales, with a special focus on Cajun culture and wordplay.[1][3][5] His book **“Petite Rouge: A Cajun Red Riding Hood”** became one of his most celebrated works, earning the National Association of Elementary School Principals’ Read Aloud Book of the Year award in 2009 and solidifying his reputation for lively, read‑aloud storytelling.[1][5] Alongside his publishing career, Artell has performed as a musician since his teens and frequently incorporates music, drawing, and humor into school visits and conference presentations on creativity, communication, and the use of humor to manage stress.[2][3][7]  

Artell’s musical side is tightly woven into his work with children and educators: during school and library visits he often brings a guitar or other instruments, getting students singing, moving, and participating as he demonstrates drawing and storytelling techniques.[7] He has addressed hundreds of thousands of students, teachers, librarians, and professionals at events for organizations such as the American Society for Training and Development and the Library of Michigan Foundation, where he presents programs on creative thinking and innovation.[1][2] Now based in Covington, Louisiana, where he lives with his wife Susan, a middle school librarian, Artell continues to create books, lead workshops, and perform music, building a legacy as a versatile communicator who blends visual art, stories, and song to spark creativity in young readers and educators alike.[1][2][3]
