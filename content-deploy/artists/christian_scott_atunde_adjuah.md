## Biography
Christian Scott aTunde Adjuah, born March 31, 1983, in New Orleans, Louisiana, is a visionary American trumpeter, composer, and producer renowned for revolutionizing contemporary jazz. Raised in a musically rich family—his uncle is the legendary saxophonist Donald Harrison, Jr.—Adjuah began his musical training under Harrison's guidance at age thirteen. He attended the New Orleans Center for Creative Arts (NOCCA) and later earned a degree in Professional Music and Film Scoring from Berklee College of Music, graduating in just thirty months. 

Launching his recording career in 2002, Adjuah quickly distinguished himself with his genre-defying approach, which he termed 'Stretch Music.' This concept expands jazz's boundaries by incorporating elements from hip-hop, rock, West African rhythms, and electronic music, creating a 'genre-blind' sound that reflects his multicultural heritage and the vibrant, complex realities of his native New Orleans. Over his prolific career, Adjuah has released more than a dozen acclaimed studio albums, earned multiple Grammy nominations, and won two Edison Awards. He is also recognized for technical innovations, such as the 'forecasting cell' harmonic convention and his signature 'whisper technique' on the trumpet, which emphasizes breath over vibration.

Adjuah's influence extends beyond performance and recording. He is the founder of the Stretch Music record label and app, a designer of new musical instruments, and the Crown Chieftain of the Xodokan Nation of the Black Tribes of New Orleans. His work confronts social and political issues, and he is widely credited with ushering in a new era of jazz, inspiring a generation of musicians to embrace innovation and cultural fusion.
