## Biography
Lila Downs was born on September 9, 1968, in Tlaxiaco, Oaxaca, Mexico, to Mixtec singer Anastasia Sanchez and Scottish-American art professor and filmmaker Allen Downs. Growing up between Oaxaca, California, and Minnesota, she navigated a dual cultural identity that would become the foundation of her artistic vision. She began singing rancheras at age 8, inspired by her mother's musical heritage and Mexican vocal legends like Chavela Vargas and Lucha Villa. After initially pursuing classical voice training and nearly reaching the Metropolitan Opera's national auditions, Downs experienced a transformative crisis of identity during her late teens, eventually returning to the University of Minnesota to complete degrees in voice and cultural anthropology in 1993.

Downs rose to international prominence in the late 1990s and early 2000s, gaining widespread acclaim following her contributions to the 2002 Frida Kahlo biopic directed by Julie Taymor and her critically acclaimed album Border (La Línea) released in 2001. Her distinctive contralto voice and genre-blending approach—fusing traditional Mexican folk, mariachi, jazz, blues, hip-hop, cumbia, and rock—established her as one of the most influential artists on the Latin American scene. She has recorded nine studio albums and earned numerous accolades, including a Grammy Award for Best Regional Mexican Music Album for Pecados y Milagros (2011) and four Latin Grammy Awards, with her collaborative album Raiz receiving nominations for Album of the Year.

Beyond her musical achievements, Downs has become a global ambassador for Mexico's folkloric traditions and a fierce social activist, recording songs in indigenous languages including Mixtec, Zapotec, Mayan, Nahuatl, and Purépecha. Her compositions often serve as striking commentaries on social conditions, migration, indigenous rights, and border issues, making her work particularly revolutionary as an indigenous woman addressing taboo topics in Mexican society. She continues to tour internationally with her longtime band La Misteriosa, connecting with diverse audiences across all ages, races, and backgrounds through her powerful artistic vision.

## Fun Facts
- After nearly reaching the Metropolitan Opera's national auditions, Downs dropped out of college on the eve of her final auditions, experiencing a crisis of identity where she was ashamed of her Native American roots and even dyed her hair blonde before following the Grateful Dead on tour.
- Downs' father, despite loving music, could not carry a melody and would encourage young Lila to sing rancheras—traditional 'farmers' songs' filled with guitars and horns—which some women in her town considered inappropriate for a little girl.
- She passed away when Lila was only 16 years old, prompting her to return to Oaxaca to reunite with her mother and eventually pursue her studies in anthropology and voice.
- Downs' 2002 contributions to the Frida Kahlo biopic directed by Julie Taymor elevated her to international star status and marked a turning point in her career trajectory.
