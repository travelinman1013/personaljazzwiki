## Biography
Them is a Northern Irish rock and R&B band formed in Belfast in 1963–64, best known for the garage rock anthem “Gloria” and for launching the career of singer‑songwriter Van Morrison.[1][2][5][6] Emerging from the East Belfast group The Gamblers, the classic early lineup featured Van Morrison on vocals, harmonica and saxophone, Billy Harrison on guitar, Alan Henderson on bass, Ronnie Millings on drums, and Eric Wrixon on keyboards.[1][2] Their residency at the Maritime Hotel in Belfast quickly became legendary for its raw, improvisatory energy and blues‑soaked sets, attracting industry attention and leading to a recording contract with Decca Records.[1][2]  

Between 1964 and 1966, Them released a string of influential singles and two albums, blending American R&B, blues, and beat music with a gritty, youthful attitude.[1][2][5] Their versions of “Baby, Please Don’t Go,” “Here Comes the Night,” and the hypnotic instrumental‑driven “Mystic Eyes” all charted, while “Gloria”—originally a B‑side—became a cornerstone of garage rock, endlessly covered by bands such as the Shadows of Knight and The Doors.[1][2][5] Behind the scenes, however, tensions over management, finances, and creative control, combined with constant lineup changes and heavy touring, strained the group; Van Morrison left in 1966 to pursue a solo career, while bassist Alan Henderson carried the Them name forward through new lineups that explored psychedelic rock on albums like *Now and Them* and *Time Out! Time In for Them* after relocating to the United States.[1][3][4]

Although the band’s commercial peak was brief, Them’s impact has been long‑lasting. Their fusion of R&B, blues, and aggressive, minimalist rock helped define mid‑1960s British and Irish R&B and laid key foundations for garage rock and later punk.[1][2][5] “Gloria” in particular became a rite of passage for countless bar bands and an enduring standard of raw rock simplicity, while the Maritime Hotel era is often cited as a defining moment in Belfast’s 1960s music scene.[1][2] Van Morrison’s subsequent success has further cemented interest in Them’s catalogue, and the group’s best‑known recordings are still praised for their intensity, soulful vocals, and surprisingly adventurous arrangements for their time.[1][2][4]

## Fun Facts
- The name “Them” was suggested by keyboardist Eric Wrixon and taken from the 1954 science‑fiction horror film *Them!*, giving the band a short, mysterious moniker.[1]
- Although Van Morrison became the focal point, early members have noted that guitarist Billy Harrison was originally regarded as the band’s leader before recording success shifted attention toward Morrison.[3]
- The single “Baby, Please Don’t Go” features session contributions from future Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page on rhythm guitar, a fact later surrounded by debate over exactly which parts he played.[1][3]
- Their breakout song “Gloria” started life as the B‑side to “Baby, Please Don’t Go” before covers by American bands turned it into one of rock’s most enduring three‑chord anthems.[1][2]

### Artists Influenced

- [[the_doors|The Doors]] - American rock band that incorporated “Gloria” into their live repertoire, extending the song’s—and thus Them’s—reach into the late 1960s rock underground. (Live performances and later recordings of “Gloria.”) [late 1960s and after]
- [[later_garage_rock_and_punk_bands_various|Later garage rock and punk bands (various)]] - “Gloria” became a template for simple, driving three‑chord rock, inspiring countless garage bands and later punk‑era acts who adopted its raw vocal style and riff‑based structure. (Numerous covers and live versions of “Gloria” and R&B‑garage arrangements modeled on Them’s early singles.) [late 1960s onward]
