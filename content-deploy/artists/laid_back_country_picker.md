## Biography
David Prince, known professionally as the Laid Back Country Picker, is a singer-songwriter and social studies teacher from Louisa, Kentucky, who has become a fixture in the outlaw and alt-country music scene. Born and raised in Eastern Kentucky during generational poverty, Prince grew up without running water in his home until age 12, with his father working various jobs including mechanic, bar owner, bootlegger, and coal truck driver. Most significantly, his father was a bluegrass musician who filled their home with music and instruments, creating an environment where young David was exposed to both traditional bluegrass and, later, rock and roll through artists like Led Zeppelin, Alice Cooper, and Aerosmith. This blend of influences would become central to his artistic identity.

Prince's early musical career began in the 1970s when he formed the rock band Cold Ethyl and famously skipped his senior class trip to perform his first bar gig at The Question Mark Club in Kermit, West Virginia, playing Alice Cooper covers for coal miners. As his responsibilities grew with marriage and a daughter, he pursued higher education at Ashland Community College and Morehead University, majoring in secondary education while continuing to perform on weekends. He became a 19-year veteran social studies teacher at Lawrence County High School in Louisa, Kentucky, where students affectionately call him "Chico" (a reference to the TV show Chico and the Man). Throughout his teaching career, Prince maintained his musical pursuits, working as a community radio DJ in Louisa, performing in country cover bands at VFW halls, and eventually forming Night Train, a Southern rock band in the mold of The Georgia Satellites.

The Laid Back Country Picker persona solidified around 2010 following a pivotal moment at a McNurlin show in Texas on the Fourth of July, when his wife photographed him in a white hat and wireframe glasses watching fireworks—an image that would become iconic to his brand. His music is characterized as devoid of genre boundaries, with one foot in the truckstop and the other in 1970s guitar rock, blending country authenticity with rock sensibilities. Prince has performed at prestigious venues including the Ryman Auditorium, Bonnaroo, and Red Rocks, maintains a regular presence on Sirius Outlaw Country Radio, and has toured nationally while recording and performing with Grammy-winning artists. His philosophy, both as a musician and educator, centers on treating people right and playing good, authentic music.

## Fun Facts
- Prince skipped his senior class trip to perform his first bar gig at The Question Mark Club in Kermit, West Virginia, where he and his band played Alice Cooper songs for coal miners, earning $500 and $30 worth of beer.
- His yard contains three vintage VW buses—one for parts and two retired road warriors plastered with stickers from former bands—along with a legless CPR dummy named Gary perched atop a broken toilet, and a collection of 8-track tapes (likely featuring Aerosmith and Alice Cooper).
- Prince briefly worked at Long John Silver's in the 1970s, where employees were required to wear full pirate costumes including white knickers, striped shirt, red sash, and bandana—a job he abandoned when his band Cold Ethyl booked an out-of-town show.
- His stage name and persona were solidified by a photograph taken by his wife on July 4th around 2010 at a McNurlin show in Texas, capturing him in a white hat and wireframe glasses watching fireworks—a pivotal moment in his music career despite him not being near a stage or instrument.
