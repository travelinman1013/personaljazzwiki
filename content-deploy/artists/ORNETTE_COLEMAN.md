## Biography
Ornette Coleman (March 9, 1930 – June 11, 2015) was a pioneering American jazz saxophonist, composer, and bandleader, widely recognized as the principal initiator of free jazz. Born in segregated Fort Worth, Texas, Coleman grew up in a musical family and began playing the alto saxophone at age 14, later adding tenor sax to his repertoire. Early hardships, including the loss of his father and sister, shaped his resilience and determination. He started his career in local rhythm-and-blues bands and, after moving to Los Angeles in the early 1950s, supported himself as an elevator operator while studying harmony and theory independently. His unconventional approach to improvisation—eschewing fixed chord changes in favor of melodic and expressive freedom—led to rejection by many established musicians but also set the stage for his revolutionary ideas.

Coleman's breakthrough came in the late 1950s, when he formed a quartet with Don Cherry, Charlie Haden, and Billy Higgins. Their recordings, including 'The Shape of Jazz to Come' (1959) and 'Change of the Century' (1960), introduced his radical 'harmolodic' theory, which allowed improvisers to abandon traditional harmonic patterns. Moving to New York, Coleman became a polarizing figure, hailed as a genius by some and dismissed as a fraud by others. His landmark album 'Free Jazz' (1960) featured two improvising quartets and cemented his status as a leading figure in avant-garde jazz. Over his career, Coleman received numerous accolades, including a MacArthur Fellowship, a Grammy, and a Pulitzer Prize for Music, and his influence extended far beyond jazz, shaping the course of modern music.

## Fun Facts
- Coleman was expelled from high school, allegedly for improvising during a performance of 'The Star-Spangled Banner,' though he later denied this.
- He often played an inexpensive plastic saxophone early in his career, which contributed to his distinctive sound.
- Coleman developed his own musical philosophy called 'harmolodics,' emphasizing equal roles for harmony, melody, and rhythm.
- He won the Pulitzer Prize for Music in 2007 for his album 'Sound Grammar,' one of the few jazz musicians to receive this honor.
