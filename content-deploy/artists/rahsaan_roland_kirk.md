## Biography
Rahsaan Roland Kirk was born Ronald Theodore Kirk on August 7, 1935, in Columbus, Ohio. He became blind at an early age but developed a passion for music, becoming a multi-instrumentalist known for playing multiple wind instruments simultaneously. Kirk's career spanned from 1955 until his death in 1977, during which he led his own bands and occasionally collaborated with notable figures like Quincy Jones and Charles Mingus. He preferred the term 'Black Classical Music' to describe his genre, reflecting his diverse influences from jazz, blues, and classical music. Kirk's unique style included circular breathing techniques and the use of unconventional instruments like the manzello and stritch. His legacy extends beyond his virtuosic performances to his advocacy for racial equality in the music industry. Kirk suffered a stroke in 1975 but continued to perform and record until his death on December 5, 1977. His impact on jazz and beyond is profound, with his music continuing to inspire generations of musicians. Kirk's ability to play multiple instruments at once, including three saxophones simultaneously, was a hallmark of his live performances, which often featured comic banter and political commentary. His influence on jazz and his contributions to the genre have been recognized globally, with his music remaining a testament to his innovative spirit and artistic genius.
