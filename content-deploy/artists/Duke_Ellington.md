## Biography
Edward Kennedy "Duke" Ellington (1899–1974) was born in Washington, D.C. to a middle-class African American family, where both parents fostered his early interest in music. Initially aspiring to be a painter, Ellington began piano lessons at age seven and was soon drawn to the vibrant ragtime and jazz scenes of his hometown. By his teens, he was performing in local bands and, in 1923, moved to New York City, where he became leader of The Washingtonians, a group that evolved into his legendary orchestra[1][2][4].

Ellington's career flourished in New York, especially after his orchestra secured a residency at Harlem's Cotton Club in 1927. The club's regular radio broadcasts propelled Ellington and his band to national fame, showcasing his innovative approach to big band jazz. Ellington was renowned for his inventive use of orchestration, blending individual musicians' sounds to create rich, complex harmonies and moods. He composed or collaborated on over a thousand pieces, including classics like "Mood Indigo," "Sophisticated Lady," and "Take the 'A' Train" (written by Billy Strayhorn)[1][3].

Throughout his five-decade career, Ellington continually expanded the boundaries of jazz, collaborating with a diverse array of musicians and composing for film, stage, and concert halls. He described his work as "beyond category," embracing influences from classical, popular, and world music. Ellington's legacy as a composer, bandleader, and cultural icon is unmatched; he is widely regarded as the most significant composer in jazz history and was posthumously awarded a Pulitzer Prize Special Award for music in 1999[1][3].
