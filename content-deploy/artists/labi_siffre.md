## Biography
Claudius Afolabi “Labi” Siffre (born 25 June 1945) is an English singer‑songwriter, poet, and activist, raised in Bayswater and Hampstead in London as the fourth of five children of a Barbadian/Belgian mother and Nigerian father.[2] Educated at a Catholic monastery school in Ealing, he gravitated toward music in his teens, forming his first band around 16 and playing jazz guitar in Soho clubs, while absorbing records by jazz greats and early rhythm and blues artists from his older brother’s collection.[2][4][6] In the late 1960s he worked in London jazz venues, including the house band at Annie Ross’s club Annie’s Room, before signing a record deal and issuing his self‑titled debut album in 1970, which introduced his clear, soulful voice and introspective songwriting.[4][6]

Throughout the 1970s Siffre released a run of albums that blended folk, soul, pop, and jazz influences, earning UK hits with songs such as “It Must Be Love,” “Crying, Laughing, Loving, Lying,” and “Watch Me,” and becoming known for gentle but emotionally direct love songs alongside increasingly socially conscious material.[2][4][5][6] After a partial retreat from recording at the end of the decade, he returned in the mid‑1980s with “(Something Inside) So Strong,” written in response to apartheid and his own experiences of racism and homophobia, which became his biggest chart success and an enduring civil‑rights anthem, winning an Ivor Novello Award for its music and lyrics.[2][3][5][6] Parallel to his music, Siffre developed a substantial body of work as a poet and playwright, publishing several poetry collections from the mid‑1990s and seeing his play “DeathWrite” staged and later televised, while maintaining a strong public voice on issues of bigotry, religion, and identity.[2][5][6]

From the 1990s onward, Siffre’s legacy expanded through sampling and covers: Madness’s hit version of “It Must Be Love” kept his songwriting in the mainstream, and hip‑hop producers drew heavily on his 1970s recordings, most famously when Eminem and Dr. Dre used the groove from “I Got The…” for “My Name Is,” and when Kanye West sampled “My Song” for “I Wonder.”[2][3][4][7] Openly gay and outspokenly atheist, Siffre has written and spoken about the intersecting prejudices he has faced as a Black, queer man in Britain, themes that run through his lyrics, essays, and poetry, and which underpin his reputation as an artist whose work marries melodic accessibility with moral and political seriousness.[2][4][5][6] His later releases, including the album “The Last Songs,” and ongoing reappraisal of his catalog have reinforced his status as a quietly influential figure in British popular music and queer cultural history.[2][3][6]

## Fun Facts
- Siffre’s 1975 song "I Got The…" was sampled for Eminem’s hit "My Name Is," but Siffre initially refused permission until sexist and homophobic lyrics were rewritten, later describing the original lines as "lazy songwriting."[2][3]
- He is openly gay and entered into a civil partnership with his long‑term partner Peter Lloyd in 2005, more than four decades after they first met in the 1960s.[2]
- Before his recording career took off, Siffre was part of the house band at Annie’s Room, a London jazz club run by vocalist Annie Ross of Lambert, Hendricks & Ross, placing him in the middle of the capital’s jazz scene.[6]
- Beyond music, Siffre is a dedicated poet and playwright, having published multiple poetry collections and written a play, "DeathWrite," that was professionally staged and later televised.[2][5]
