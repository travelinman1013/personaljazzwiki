## Biography
The Clark Sisters are an American gospel vocal group consisting of five sisters—Jacky Clark Chisholm (born 1948), Denise 'Niecy' Clark-Bradford (born 1953), Elbernita 'Twinkie' Clark (born 1954), Dorinda Clark-Cole (born 1957), and Karen Clark Sheard (born 1960)—daughters of renowned gospel musician and choral director Dr. Mattie Moss Clark. Born and raised in Detroit, Michigan, they began singing in their father's Church of God in Christ choir during the late 1960s, performing songs written and arranged by their mother. Following their parents' divorce in 1973, Dr. Clark formally established the group, leading to their debut album *Jesus Has a Lot to Give* on Billesse Records.[1][3]

The group's career gained momentum after signing with Sound of Gospel Records in 1974, releasing albums like *Unworthy* and *Count It All Joy*. Twinkie Clark took over as chief songwriter, arranger, conductor, and producer, propelling their breakthrough with the 1980 live album *Is My Living in Vain?*, which topped Billboard's Spiritual Albums chart. Pioneers of contemporary gospel, they blended jazz, funk, and Black church traditions, achieving mainstream crossover success with hits like 'You Brought the Sunshine.'[1][5]

With 20 albums, millions in sales, and status as the highest-selling female gospel group in history, the Clark Sisters have won three Grammy Awards (including two in 2007 for 'Blessed & Highly Favored' and *Live: One Last Time*), received seven nominations, and earned honors like the 2024 Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award and 2022 Black Music & Entertainment Walk of Fame induction. Despite lineup changes, including Denise's departure, they remain influential legends active since 1966.[1][2][3]
