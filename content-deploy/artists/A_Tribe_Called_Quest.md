## Biography
A Tribe Called Quest emerged from St. Albans, Queens, New York, in 1985, founded by childhood friends Q-Tip (Kamaal Ibn John Fareed), Phife Dawg (Malik Taylor), Ali Shaheed Muhammad, and Jarobi White[5][6]. The group quickly distinguished itself in the late 1980s and early 1990s by blending jazz, funk, and Afrocentric themes into their music, pioneering the jazz-rap subgenre and helping to define alternative hip hop[4][6]. Their debut album, 'People’s Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm' (1990), introduced their innovative sound, but it was their sophomore effort, 'The Low End Theory' (1991), that cemented their legacy, seamlessly fusing jazz basslines with hip-hop beats and socially conscious, witty lyrics[4][5]. Over the next few years, they released 'Midnight Marauders' (1993), further solidifying their status as one of hip-hop’s most influential acts. The group disbanded in 1998 but reunited in 2006 for touring and again in 2015, leading to their final album, 'We Got It from Here… Thank You 4 Your Service' (2016), completed after Phife Dawg’s death[5][6]. A Tribe Called Quest’s legacy lies in their musical innovation, lyrical depth, and enduring influence on generations of artists, remaining a cornerstone of hip-hop culture[1][6].
