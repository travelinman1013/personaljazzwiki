## Biography
Ruth Brown, born Ruth Alston Weston on January 12, 1928 in Portsmouth, Virginia, was the eldest of seven children in a musical family, with her father serving as a church choir director. Her earliest musical experiences came from singing in the Emmanuel AME church choir, but as a teenager, she gravitated toward jazz and popular music, inspired by artists like Billie Holiday, Dinah Washington, and Sarah Vaughan. Defying her father's wishes, she began performing in local clubs and eventually ran away at age 17 with musician Jimmy Brown, whom she later married[3][6].

Brown's career took off in 1949 after a serious car accident left her hospitalized; she signed her first contract with Atlantic Records from her hospital bed. Her debut single, "So Long," marked the beginning of a string of hits that defined the sound of rhythm and blues in the 1950s. Songs like "Teardrops from My Eyes," "5-10-15 Hours," and "(Mama) He Treats Your Daughter Mean" dominated the R&B charts, earning her the nickname "Miss Rhythm" and helping Atlantic Records become known as "the house that Ruth built"[1][2][4]. Brown's style blended boogie-woogie, jazz blues, swing, rockabilly, and pop, bringing a new level of sophistication and crossover appeal to R&B music.

After her initial success, Brown experienced a resurgence in the 1970s and 1980s, expanding into acting and Broadway, notably winning a Tony Award for her role in "Black and Blue." She became a powerful advocate for musicians' rights, helping to establish the Rhythm and Blues Foundation to support artists in securing fair royalties. Brown's legacy is cemented by her induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the National Rhythm & Blues Hall of Fame, as well as a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. Her influence on American music endures, with Rolling Stone ranking her among the greatest singers of all time[1][2][3].
