## Biography
Kathy Mattea, born June 21, 1959, in South Charleston and raised in Cross Lanes, West Virginia, is one of the most respected and versatile voices in American country music. She began her musical journey with classical voice training and guitar lessons in junior high, later joining the bluegrass band Pennsboro while attending West Virginia University. In 1978, Mattea moved to Nashville, where she worked various jobs—including as a tour guide at the Country Music Hall of Fame and a demo singer—before landing a recording contract with Mercury Records in 1983.

Mattea's breakthrough came with her third album, 'Walk the Way the Wind Blows' (1986), which produced her first major hits and established her as a leading figure in country music. Her subsequent albums, including 'Untasted Honey' (1987) and 'Willow in the Wind' (1989), yielded multiple No. 1 singles and gold certifications. Known for blending elements of folk, bluegrass, gospel, and Celtic music into her sound, Mattea has won two Grammy Awards and two CMA Female Vocalist of the Year honors. Her later work, such as the critically acclaimed 'Coal' (2008), explored Appalachian themes and social issues, further cementing her legacy as a thoughtful interpreter and storyteller. Over her career, she has recorded nearly a dozen albums, topped charts, and collaborated with a wide range of artists, earning a reputation as one of Nashville's finest song interpreters.
