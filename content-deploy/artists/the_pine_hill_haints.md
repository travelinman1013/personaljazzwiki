## Biography
The Pine Hill Haints are a roots music band formed in 1998 in Huntsville, Alabama, by frontman Jamie Barrier, who grew up immersed in local musical traditions through his grandfather and early exposure at hootenannies[1][3]. Barrier's formative years included singing in the Pine Hill Cemetery, which inspired the band's name and their self-described style of 'Alabama ghost country,' blending honky tonk, rockabilly, folk, and bluegrass[1][2][6]. The band began as a side project to Barrier's rockabilly group The Wednesdays and quickly developed into a distinct entity, with a revolving lineup that eventually solidified around core members Matt Bakula (washtub bass, banjo), Ben Rhyne (snare drum), and Jamie's wife, Katie Barrier (washboard, mandolin)[1][3].

The Haints have spent over two decades reviving and reinterpreting American musical forms that have faded from the mainstream, drawing on Appalachian, country-blues, folk, spirituals, and early rock 'n' roll influences[2][5]. Their minimalist setup and multi-instrumental approach allow them to weave a rich tapestry of sound that is both informed by tradition and wholly original. Early releases were issued on Barrier's own Arkam Records before attracting the attention of K Records founder Calvin Johnson, leading to broader recognition and a series of albums including 'Ghost Dance' (2007), 'To Win or to Lose' (2009), and 'Welcome to the Midnight Opry' (2011)[1].

Known for their lo-fi aesthetic and energetic live performances, The Pine Hill Haints have become respected figures in the Americana and southern gothic scenes, influencing a new generation of roots musicians. Their legacy lies in their commitment to keeping 'dead' music alive, performing styles that are rarely heard in contemporary settings and maintaining a strong connection to the mystical and historical roots of northern Alabama[2][7][9].
