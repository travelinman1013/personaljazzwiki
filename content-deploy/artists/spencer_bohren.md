## Biography
Spencer Bohren was born on April 5, 1950, in Casper, Wyoming, into a gospel-singing family. Immersed in church harmonies from a young age, he began performing publicly as a teenager after being inspired by folk music on the radio. By the late 1960s, Bohren had left Wyoming for Denver, where he absorbed acoustic folk-blues traditions firsthand from artists such as Rev. Gary Davis, and later honed his craft in Seattle’s blues scene. 

In the mid-1970s, Bohren relocated to New Orleans, a city that profoundly shaped his musical identity. He became a fixture in the local scene, performing regularly at legendary venues like Tipitina’s and the Old Absinthe Bar. His career as a touring musician flourished, and from 1983 he spent seven years traveling the U.S. with his family, sharing his blend of blues, folk, gospel, and country. Bohren’s discography spans over 20 solo albums, including collaborations with Dr. John and tributes to his musical heroes Hank Williams and Bob Dylan. He was also known for his evocative lap steel guitar work and his ability to convey deep emotion with subtlety and grace.

Bohren’s legacy is rooted in his mastery of American roots music and his commitment to sharing its traditions. He performed at major festivals across the U.S. and Europe, opened for icons like B.B. King and Muddy Waters, and influenced countless musicians through his performances, recordings, and teaching. He passed away on June 8, 2019, in New Orleans, leaving behind a rich musical heritage and a devoted family.
