## Biography
Wilburt 'Red' Prysock (February 2, 1926 – July 19, 1993) was an American R&B tenor saxophonist born in Greensboro, North Carolina, who became one of the early Coleman Hawkins-influenced saxophonists to pivot toward rhythm and blues rather than bebop. Prysock's musical journey began during his service in the United States Army during World War II, where he learned to play the saxophone. After the war, he moved north to Buffalo, New York in his early years, where his initial interest in music developed. He first gained significant attention as a member of Tiny Bradshaw's band in the early 1950s, delivering the lead saxophone solo on Bradshaw's hit 'Soft' in 1952, which showcased his emerging talent in the R&B and jump blues genres.

Prysock's career reached its commercial peak after signing with Mercury Records as a bandleader in 1954. His biggest hit came in 1955 with the instrumental 'Hand Clappin',' which became his signature recording and established him as a prominent figure in the honking tenor saxophone style. During this period, he participated in saxophone battles with other notable musicians, including a memorable contest with Benny Golson on 'Battle of the Mass' with Tiny Grimes and his Rocking Highlanders. In 1955, he joined the band that performed at Alan Freed's influential stage shows, further cementing his place in the rock and roll and R&B landscape. Throughout the 1960s, Prysock also played on several hit records by his brother, singer Arthur Prysock, demonstrating the musical talents that ran in the family.

Red Prysock's legacy rests on his distinctive honking tenor saxophone style and his role in bridging the gap between traditional jazz and the emerging rhythm and blues sound of the 1950s. His prolific recording career with Mercury Records produced numerous albums including 'Rock and Roll' (1956), 'Fruit Boots' (1957), 'The Beat' (1957), and 'Swing Softly Red' (1958), among others. Prysock passed away on July 19, 1993, in Chicago at the age of 67 from a heart attack, and was buried at Salisbury National Cemetery in Salisbury, North Carolina. His contributions to early R&B and jump blues saxophone playing remain influential in understanding the evolution of American popular music in the post-war era.
