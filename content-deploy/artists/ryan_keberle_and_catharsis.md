## Biography
Ryan Keberle & Catharsis is the flagship ensemble of acclaimed American trombonist, composer, and arranger Ryan Keberle, who was born on June 16, 1980, in Spokane, Washington. Raised in a musically rich environment—his father a jazz trumpeter and professor, his mother a piano teacher—Keberle began his musical journey with classical violin and piano before embracing the trombone as his primary instrument. He excelled academically and musically, eventually studying at the Manhattan School of Music and Juilliard, where he trained with renowned jazz educators and performers.

In 2012, after years of collaborating with jazz luminaries and pop icons alike, Keberle formed Catharsis, a pianoless quartet originally featuring Mike Rodriguez (trumpet), Jorge Roeder (bass), and Eric Doob (drums). The group quickly gained recognition for its melodic, groove-driven sound, blending jazz tradition with Latin, blues, and contemporary influences. Over time, the ensemble expanded to include guitarist and vocalist Camila Meza, further enriching its sonic palette. Catharsis has released several acclaimed albums, including 'Music is Emotion,' 'Into the Zone,' 'Azul Infinito,' 'Find the Common, Shine a Light,' and 'The Hope I Hold,' the latter inspired by Langston Hughes’ poetry.

Keberle’s work with Catharsis is lauded for its emotional depth, inventive arrangements, and seamless integration of diverse musical styles. The group’s legacy lies in its ability to honor jazz’s roots while forging new pathways, making Keberle a leading voice in modern jazz and an influential figure for a new generation of musicians.
