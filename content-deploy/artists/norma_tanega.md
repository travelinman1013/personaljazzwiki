## Biography
Norma Cecilia Tanega (January 30, 1939 – December 29, 2019) was an American singer-songwriter, painter, and experimental musician whose work bridged folk, pop, and avant-garde traditions. Born in Vallejo, California to a Panamanian mother and a Filipino father who was a US Navy bandmaster, Tanega moved to Long Beach at age two and began classical piano lessons at nine. She attended Scripps College on a full scholarship, earning her MFA from Claremont Graduate School in 1962, and was deeply involved in both music and visual arts from an early age.

After traveling Europe, Tanega settled in New York City's Greenwich Village, immersing herself in the vibrant folk scene and performing at coffee houses and summer camps. Her breakthrough came in 1966 with the whimsical hit 'Walkin' My Cat Named Dog,' which reached #22 on the US and UK charts and #3 in Canada. The song's playful lyricism and folk-rock style reflected Tanega's unique approach, blending acoustic guitar, pop-soul production, and poetic storytelling. She also wrote songs for Dusty Springfield, with whom she had a personal and creative partnership. In later years, Tanega returned to California, focusing on teaching, painting, and increasingly experimental music, performing with groups such as Ceramic Ensemble, hybridVigor, Baboonz, and Latin Lizards.

Tanega's legacy endures through her genre-defying catalog and her influence on folk and experimental music. Her song 'You're Dead' found renewed popularity as the theme for the film and TV series 'What We Do in the Shadows.' As a queer woman of color, Tanega was a pioneering figure in both music and art, celebrated for her independence, creativity, and commitment to living authentically. Her work continues to inspire new generations of musicians and artists.
