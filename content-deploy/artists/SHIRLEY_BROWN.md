## Biography
Shirley Brown, born January 6, 1947, in West Memphis, Arkansas, was raised in Madison, Illinois, after her family relocated during her childhood. She began singing gospel in church at the age of nine, quickly gaining recognition for her powerful and expressive voice, which would later draw frequent comparisons to Aretha Franklin. Discovered at age 14 by blues legend Albert King while performing at the Harlem Club in Brooklyn, Illinois, Brown spent nine formative years touring with King, who also became her manager and mentor.

By the early 1970s, Brown had begun recording professionally, first with the Abet label under the guidance of bandleader Oliver Sain. In 1974, at King's recommendation, she signed with Stax Records in Memphis. Her debut single for Stax, "Woman to Woman," became a landmark hit, spending two weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard R&B chart and selling over a million copies. The song's confessional style and dramatic spoken intro made it a Southern soul classic and Stax's final major hit before the label's collapse. Brown continued her career with Arista Records and later with Malaco Records, where she remained a respected live performer and recording artist, particularly in the American South.

Brown's musical style is rooted in classic Southern soul and blues, characterized by emotionally charged vocals and storytelling. Despite not replicating the commercial success of "Woman to Woman," she has maintained a devoted following and is regarded as a significant figure in the evolution of soul music, influencing subsequent generations of singers.
