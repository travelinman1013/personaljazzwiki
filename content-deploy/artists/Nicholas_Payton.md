## Biography
Nicholas Payton, born September 26, 1973, in New Orleans, Louisiana, is a Grammy Award-winning trumpeter, multi-instrumentalist, composer, producer, and social activist. Raised in a deeply musical family—his father, Walter Payton, was a renowned bassist and sousaphonist, and his mother, Maria Payton, a pianist and vocalist—Payton began playing trumpet at age four and was performing professionally by age ten. He was immersed early in the New Orleans brass band tradition, sitting in with the Young Tuxedo Brass Band by age nine and receiving his first steady gig from guitarist Danny Barker at The Famous Door on Bourbon Street. He attended the New Orleans Center for Creative Arts and the University of New Orleans, quickly establishing himself as a prodigy and a sought-after musician.

Payton's career accelerated in the 1990s, touring with jazz luminaries such as Marcus Roberts and Elvin Jones before signing with Verve Records. His debut album, 'From This Moment,' was released in 1995, and he won a Grammy Award in 1997 for Best Instrumental Solo on 'Doc Cheatham & Nicholas Payton.' Over his career, Payton has released more than 20 albums as a leader, traversing traditional and contemporary styles and collaborating with artists across genres, including Ray Charles, Herbie Hancock, and Jill Scott. Notably, he is a vocal critic of the limitations of the term 'jazz,' advocating instead for the broader concept of 'Black American Music' (#BAM), a term he introduced to highlight the lineage and cultural breadth of Black music in America.

Payton's work as a composer includes orchestral pieces such as 'The Black American Symphony,' and he has performed with major symphony orchestras. His writings and activism have influenced discourse on race, genre, and the legacy of Black musicians in American culture. Through his innovative artistry and outspoken advocacy, Payton remains a leading force in shaping the evolution and understanding of Black American music.
