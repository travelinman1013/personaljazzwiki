## Biography
Robin Leonard Trower, born on March 9, 1945, in Catford, South London, England, began his professional music career in the mid-1960s with the Southend rhythm and blues band The Paramounts alongside Gary Brooker and B.J. Wilson[1][3][6][7]. He gained prominence in 1967 joining Procol Harum, contributing to their first five albums and extensive tours, though not on their hit 'A Whiter Shade of Pale'; Trower credits Gary Brooker for launching his career[1][2][3]. Leaving Procol Harum in 1971, he launched a solo career modeled on power trios like Cream, Taste, and the Jimi Hendrix Experience, forming the Robin Trower Band with vocalist/bassist James Dewar and drummer Reg Isidore[1][2].

His 1973 debut *Twice Removed from Yesterday* set the stage, but 1974's *Bridge of Sighs* became a breakthrough, selling a million copies with standout tracks like 'Day of the Eagle,' 'Too Rolling Stoned,' and 'Lady Love,' showcasing his atmospheric, effects-laden Stratocaster style blending blues rock and Hendrix-inspired sounds[1][2][4]. Trower explored further with albums like *In City Dreams* and *Caravan to Midnight* (both 1977, produced by Don Davis), emphasizing his blues roots and maturing songwriting[1][4]. Despite shifts in music trends like punk, he maintained a strong U.S. live following, founded his V12 label in the 1990s for releases like *20th Century Blues* (1994), and continued into the 2010s with albums such as *Seven Moons* (2008, with Jack Bruce) and *Something’s About To Change* (2015)[1].

Trower's legacy endures as a blues-rock guitar legend, known for his soulful, melodic playing influenced by post-war U.S. blues, with over five decades of output including 14 post-millennial albums, retaining passion and vitality outside major label constraints[1][2][4]. His genres include blues rock, blues, and modern blues, with Spotify popularity at 45[context].

## Fun Facts
- After seeing Albert King live, Trower was so overwhelmed he wanted to quit playing guitar, taking about a year to recover[4].
- Trower started his own V12 record label in the 1990s to gain creative freedom, releasing *20th Century Blues* in 1994 and continuing independently[1].
- He briefly took on lead vocals in the 1990s, reasoning that blues artists typically sing their own material to match their vision[1].
- Songs Trower wrote for Eric Gales, after Gales supported his tour, became the basis for his 2003 album *Living Out of Time*[1].
