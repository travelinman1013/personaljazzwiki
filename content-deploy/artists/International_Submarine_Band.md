## Biography
The International Submarine Band (ISB) was formed in 1965 by Gram Parsons while he was briefly a theology student at Harvard University. Parsons, inspired by his Southern upbringing and exposure to country music, was encouraged by guitarist John Nuese—who had deep roots in country—to pursue a fusion of country and rock. Alongside Parsons and Nuese, the original lineup included bassist Ian Dunlop and drummer Mickey Gauvin, all of whom were active in the Boston-area folk and rock scene. The band's name was inspired by a 1934 'Our Gang' comedy short, referencing a fictional group called 'The International Silver String Submarine Band.'

After relocating to New York City in 1966, the ISB recorded several singles but struggled to find commercial success. By 1967, the group had moved to Los Angeles, where Parsons and Nuese, now joined by drummer Jon Corneal and various session musicians, signed with Lee Hazlewood's LHI Records. This lineup recorded the band's only full-length album, 'Safe at Home' (1968), which is now recognized as a pioneering work in the country rock genre. Despite their brief existence and limited commercial impact, the ISB laid the groundwork for Parsons' later influential work with The Byrds and The Flying Burrito Brothers.

Musically, the ISB was groundbreaking for blending traditional country instrumentation and songwriting with the sensibilities of 1960s rock and folk. Their innovative approach prefigured the emergence of country rock and Americana, influencing countless artists who would follow. Although the band dissolved before 'Safe at Home' was even released, their legacy endures as a catalyst for the genre's development and as the launching pad for Gram Parsons' storied career.

## Fun Facts
- The band's name was inspired by a fictional group in a 1934 'Our Gang' comedy short called 'Mike Fright.'
- ISB's only album, 'Safe at Home,' was released after the band had already broken up.
- Gram Parsons used his trust fund to support the band during their early days in New York City.
