## Biography
Serapicos is an alternative rock band from São Paulo, Brazil, formed in 2010 by brothers and songwriters Gabriel and Pedro Serapicos.[1] Coming out of the cosmopolitan urban scene of São Paulo, they quickly shaped a distinctive identity around what they themselves frame as “pseudo‑romantic” songs—lyrically playful, slightly off‑kilter narratives set against inventive rock arrangements. Gabriel initially gathered around fifteen songs in English to record the band’s first album, *Serapicos is a town*, establishing their authorial, cinema‑inflected approach early on.[1]

Over the next few years, Serapicos developed a more explicitly Portuguese‑language repertoire, culminating in the concept album *17 canções em português para ouvir antes de morrer – parte I* (2013), recorded after winning the Lab MIS grant from São Paulo’s Museu da Imagem e do Som.[1] Critics and promotional materials describe their music as an inventive blend that coherently mixes the atmosphere of Coen Brothers films with deliberately kitschy romantic ballads, all filtered through a cosmopolitan rock lens.[1] By 2014, the live lineup had expanded beyond the founding brothers to include Matheus Souza (drums), Allan André (bass), Ana Guariglia (piano), Victória Vaz (vocals), and Caio Nazaro (guitar), giving their shows a fuller, more theatrical character.[1] While they remain a cult name rather than a mainstream act, their Lab MIS recognition, conceptual releases, and distinctive pseudo‑romantic style have secured them a small but devoted following in the Brazilian independent scene.[1][5]

## Fun Facts
- The album title *17 canções em português para ouvir antes de morrer – parte I* (‘17 songs in Portuguese to listen to before you die – part I’) is deliberately tongue‑in‑cheek and ‘self‑explanatory,’ underlining the band’s darkly humorous, pseudo‑romantic aesthetic.[1]
- Serapicos financed and recorded *17 canções em português para ouvir antes de morrer – parte I* after winning the Lab MIS grant from São Paulo’s Museu da Imagem e do Som, a competitive public funding program for innovative audiovisual and musical projects.[1]
- For the launch of their track and video “Buscopan” at Centro Cultural São Paulo, promotional material promised a ‘historic and danceable’ Sunday matinee show, jokingly comparing it to a Paul McCartney concert but ‘cheaper and without VIP area.’[1]
- The band’s own description likens their sound to a cohesive mixture of Coen Brothers films and cheesy romantic ballads, reflecting their blend of cinematic references, irony, and heartfelt songwriting.[1]
