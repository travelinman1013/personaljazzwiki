## Biography
Lester Raymond Brown (March 14, 1912 – January 4, 2001), born in Reinerton, Pennsylvania (also noted as Tower City), began playing saxophone at an early age and made his professional debut in a band while young. By age 14, he won a musical scholarship to the New York Military Academy, where he led the dance band and glee club, graduating in 1932. He attended Duke University from 1932 to 1936, leading the Duke Blue Devils dance band, which recorded for Decca and toured extensively along the East Coast in 1936. After the tour, Brown relocated to New York and formed his own band in 1938, which evolved into Les Brown and His Band of Renown, a big band specializing in swing music that endured for nearly seven decades.[1][2][3][4][6]

The band's breakthrough came in 1945 with the hit 'Sentimental Journey,' co-composed by Brown and featuring vocalist Doris Day, which became an unofficial homecoming anthem for WWII veterans. They achieved nine number-one hits, including 'I've Got My Love to Keep Me Warm.' From 1947, the band served as Bob Hope's regular accompaniment for nearly 50 years across radio, stage, TV, and 18 USO tours worldwide, entertaining over three million troops. They also acted as house band for shows like The Steve Allen Show and The Dean Martin Show (1961–1969), adapting through the decline of big bands in the 1960s.[1][2][4][5]

Brown's legacy includes composing, arranging, and leading one of the longest-running big bands, influencing the swing era's persistence. His son, Les Brown Jr., took over full-time leadership in 2001, continuing performances globally, including in Branson, Missouri. Brown was involved in founding the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (NARAS), serving as president of its L.A. chapter and enabling the first televised Grammy Awards.[1][4][5]
