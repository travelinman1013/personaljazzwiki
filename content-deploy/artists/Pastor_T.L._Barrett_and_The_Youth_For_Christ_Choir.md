## Biography
Pastor T.L. Barrett was born Thomas Lee Barrett, Jr. on January 13, 1944, in Jamaica, Long Island, New York. His family moved to Chicago when he was eight years old to assist his aunt in building a church on the South Side. Barrett became a pastor at a young age and focused on youth outreach, forming the Youth for Christ Choir as part of his community work. The choir was an after-school program aimed at keeping children off the streets, and it became a platform for Barrett to express his musical talents alongside his spiritual mission. His music blended gospel with soul and funk elements, attracting notable figures like Donny Hathaway and members of Earth, Wind & Fire to his congregation. Barrett's legacy is marked by both his influential music and his later controversies, including financial scandals involving his church. Despite these challenges, his musical contributions remain significant, particularly in the realm of contemporary gospel. Barrett's style was characterized by his ability to merge personal and communal narratives in his songs, often shifting between 'I' and 'we' pronouns to emphasize unity and collective empowerment. His work with the Youth for Christ Choir resulted in albums that showcased the choir's emotional maturity and depth, surprising listeners with their professionalism despite their young age.
