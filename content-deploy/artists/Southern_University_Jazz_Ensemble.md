## Biography
The Southern University Jazz Ensemble, led by the renowned clarinetist and educator Alvin Batiste, is a significant part of the New Orleans jazz scene. Under Batiste's guidance, the ensemble produced two notable albums: *Live at the 1971 American College Jazz Festival* and *Goes to Africa With Love*. These albums, initially distributed as souvenirs, have been reissued commercially by Now-Again Records, showcasing Batiste's original compositions and jazz classics. The ensemble's music reflects a blend of spiritual jazz and African influences, contributing to the rich musical heritage of New Orleans. Alvin Batiste, a recipient of the 'Best of The Beat' Lifetime Achievement Award in Music Education, played a pivotal role in shaping the ensemble's style and legacy. Despite his influence, Batiste's own profile remained relatively low, with few albums released under his name. However, his work with the Southern University Jazz Ensemble has gained recognition for its unique blend of jazz and cultural exploration. The ensemble's performances and recordings have been celebrated for their energy and improvisational depth, reflecting Batiste's emphasis on ensemble interaction and individual creativity.
