## Biography
Robert Finley, born February 13, 1954, in Bernice, Louisiana, is a celebrated American blues and soul singer-songwriter and guitarist. Raised in a deeply religious family of sharecroppers, Finley's earliest musical experiences centered around gospel music, which profoundly shaped his vocal and instrumental style. He bought his first guitar at age 11 and, despite his family's reservations about secular music, began teaching himself by watching gospel quartets and practicing on his own. By age 17, Finley joined the U.S. Army, where he became a guitarist and bandleader for the Army band, performing throughout Europe before returning home.

After his military service, Finley spent decades as a carpenter and street performer, leading the gospel group Brother Finley and the Gospel Sisters while playing blues and soul in local venues. His musical career was interrupted when he was declared legally blind in his 60s, forcing him to retire from carpentry. In 2015, the Music Maker Relief Foundation discovered him performing on the street, leading to his debut album, 'Age Don’t Mean a Thing,' at age 62. This late-blooming success attracted the attention of Dan Auerbach of The Black Keys, resulting in a fruitful collaboration and a series of acclaimed albums, including 'Goin’ Platinum!' (2017), 'Sharecropper’s Son' (2021), and 'Black Bayou' (2023).

Finley’s music blends southern soul, blues, gospel, and rock, characterized by his gritty, emotive vocals and authentic storytelling rooted in his Louisiana upbringing. Despite losing his sight, Finley has become a globally recognized performer, earning critical acclaim, international tours, and appearances on national television. His life and music stand as a testament to perseverance and the enduring power of the blues.
