## Biography
The George Lewis Ragtime Band was led by George Lewis, a renowned American jazz clarinetist born in New Orleans in 1900. Lewis began playing clarinet professionally as a teenager, quickly establishing himself within the vibrant New Orleans jazz scene. During the 1920s and 1930s, he performed with many local groups, including the Olympia Brass Band, Eureka Brass Band, and his own early ensembles, often collaborating with notable musicians such as Buddy Petit and Henry 'Red' Allen. The economic hardships of the Great Depression forced Lewis to take work outside of music, but he continued to play part-time, maintaining his deep connection to traditional New Orleans jazz.

Lewis’s career experienced a dramatic revival in the 1940s, when he was featured as the clarinetist in Bunk Johnson’s band for a series of influential recordings that sparked renewed interest in early jazz. After Johnson’s retirement, Lewis took over leadership of the band, which became known as the George Lewis Ragtime Band. Under his direction, the group became central to the New Orleans jazz revival, recording extensively and touring internationally, including celebrated visits to the UK, Denmark, and Japan. Lewis’s clarinet style was characterized by lyrical phrasing, rhythmic arpeggios, and a deeply expressive tone that resonated with audiences worldwide. He remained a fixture at Preservation Hall in New Orleans until his death in 1968, leaving a lasting legacy as one of the most influential figures in traditional jazz.
