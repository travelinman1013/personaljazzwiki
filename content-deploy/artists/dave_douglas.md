## Biography
Dave Douglas was born on March 24, 1963, in the New York City area, where he demonstrated early musical aptitude by starting piano at age five, switching to trombone at seven, and discovering the trumpet at nine.[1][5] He formalized his musical education at prestigious institutions, studying at Berklee School of Music and the New England Conservatory in Boston from 1981 to 1983, before moving to New York City in 1984 to attend New York University, where he studied trumpet directly with the renowned pedagogue Carmine Caruso.[1][3] His early career was marked by diverse collaborations, including work with experimental rock band Dr. Nerve, organist Jack McDuff, saxophonist Vincent Herring, and street bands throughout New York City, before catching the attention of jazz legend Horace Silver, with whom he toured the US and Europe in 1987.[1]

Douglas emerged as a major force in contemporary jazz during the 1990s, launching his solo recording career in 1993 with *Parallel Worlds* on Soul Note Records, a groundbreaking album that blended serial composition techniques with arrangements of classical composers like Webern, Stravinsky, and Ellington.[1][2] Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, he led multiple innovative ensembles including the Tiny Bell Trio (which pioneered a fusion of jazz and Balkan music), the Charms of the Night Sky chamber ensemble, the Dave Douglas Sextet, and maintained a long-standing association with John Zorn's Masada quartet beginning in 1993.[3] His prolific output and stylistic breadth earned him unprecedented recognition, winning the Down Beat Critics Poll for Trumpet Player of the Year seven consecutive times between 2000 and 2007, plus additional wins in 2009 and 2011, while also receiving a Guggenheim Fellowship in 2005.[4]

In 2005, after releasing seven critically acclaimed albums for Bluebird/RCA, Douglas founded his own independent record label, Greenleaf Music, establishing himself as what critics have called "the unassuming king of independent jazz."[2][6] With over 50 albums as a leader and more than 500 published compositions, Douglas has become recognized as one of the most important and original American musicians to emerge from the jazz and improvised music scene, known for his restless experimentation and ability to synthesize diverse musical traditions ranging from Eastern European folk to Argentinian music to contemporary classical composition.[1][3][9]
