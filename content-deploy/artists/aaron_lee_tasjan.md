## Biography
Aaron Lee Tasjan, born August 24, 1986 in Wilmington, Delaware, is an American singer-songwriter, guitarist, and producer known for his genre-defying approach to Americana, alt-country, and indie rock. Raised in a musical family, Tasjan taught himself guitar at age 11 by learning Oasis songs and quickly became a sought-after guitarist, performing with Peter Yarrow by age 16 and earning the Outstanding Guitarist Award at Jazz at Lincoln Center. After high school, he declined a Berklee College of Music scholarship to move to Brooklyn, where he formed the glam rock band Semi Precious Weapons, later collaborating with the New York Dolls and founding The Madison Square Gardeners.

Tasjan relocated to Nashville in 2013 to focus on songwriting and his solo career, releasing a string of critically acclaimed albums including 'In the Blazes' (2015), 'Silver Tears' (2016), 'Karma for Cheap' (2018), and 'Stellar Evolution' (2023). His music is celebrated for its sharp lyrical wit, sonic adventurousness, and openness about his queer identity, blending influences from classic Americana to glam rock and synth-pop. Tasjan’s songwriting has earned him a Grammy nomination for his work on Yola’s 'Diamond Studded Shoes' and a reputation as one of Nashville’s most innovative and inclusive voices.

A restless musical shapeshifter, Tasjan is known for his ability to reinvent his sound with each project, drawing on a wide range of influences and collaborators. His legacy is marked by both his genre versatility and his advocacy for LGBTQ representation in Americana music, as well as his role as a mentor and producer for emerging artists.
