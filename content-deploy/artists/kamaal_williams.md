## Biography
Kamaal Williams, born Henry Gilbert Williams on December 14, 1989, in Peckham, South London, is a British musician, keyboardist, and record producer known for his innovative blend of jazz, funk, and electronic music[5][3]. Williams began his musical journey playing drums in high school before focusing on keyboards and studying music more formally[6]. Under the alias Henry Wu, he initially produced electronic music, particularly house and broken beat, before transitioning to a broader jazz-influenced sound[1][8].

Williams rose to prominence in 2016 as one half of the duo Yussef Kamaal, alongside drummer Yussef Dayes. Their acclaimed album 'Black Focus' helped spearhead the London jazz renaissance, fusing '70s jazz fusion, funk, hip-hop, and modern electronic elements[2][4][3]. After the duo disbanded, Williams continued to develop his sound as a solo artist under the name Kamaal Williams, releasing albums that further explore the intersections of nu jazz, jazz funk, and jazz fusion[3]. His work is celebrated for its rhythmic complexity, improvisational spirit, and ability to bridge traditional jazz with contemporary urban sounds, making him a key figure in the new wave of British jazz[7].
