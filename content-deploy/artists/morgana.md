## Biography
Morgana King, born Maria Grazia Morgana Messina on June 4, 1930, in Pleasantville, New York, was a celebrated American jazz singer and actress[1][4]. Raised in a musically inclined Sicilian family, King’s vocal talent was recognized early, earning her a scholarship to the Metropolitan School of Music at age 14[1][3]. She began her professional singing career at sixteen, quickly gaining attention for her unique phrasing and remarkable four-octave contralto range while performing in Greenwich Village nightclubs[1][2]. Her debut album, 'For You, For Me, For Evermore,' was released in 1956, and she continued to record prolifically into the late 1990s[1].

King’s musical style fused jazz with operatic flourishes, melismatic wails, and influences from classical, Sephardic, and Arabic music[3]. Her breakthrough hit, 'A Taste of Honey,' showcased her ability to reinvent songs with dramatic intensity and technical virtuosity[3]. Throughout her career, she collaborated with renowned musicians and was admired by jazz legends such as Duke Ellington and Billie Holiday[3]. Beyond music, King achieved cinematic fame as Carmela Corleone in 'The Godfather' (1972) and its sequel, bringing her expressive artistry to a wider audience[1][4][5].

Morgana King’s legacy is defined by her adventurous approach to vocal jazz, her mentorship of younger musicians, and her lasting influence on the genre. Her innovative interpretations and emotional depth have inspired generations of jazz vocalists, cementing her place as a pioneering figure in American music[3].
