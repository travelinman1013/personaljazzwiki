## Biography
Bria Skonberg is a Juno Award-winning trumpeter, vocalist, and songwriter born in 1983 in Chilliwack, British Columbia, Canada.[4] She was introduced to jazz through a spirited public school band program and local festival in her hometown, picking up the trumpet in seventh grade.[4] Her family, composed of teachers, fostered a musical environment where her older brother played Old Time fiddle and she took piano lessons in elementary school.[4] After obtaining her degree in Trumpet Performance from Capilano University in Vancouver, Skonberg established herself as a professional bandleader while still in her teens, eventually relocating to New York City in 2010 to pursue her career at a higher level.[2]

Since arriving in New York, Skonberg has become a prominent figure in the revival of classic American music and the New Orleans hot jazz tradition. Described by The Wall Street Journal as "one of the most versatile and imposing musicians of her generation" and by The New York Times as the "shining hope of hot jazz," she has performed at hundreds of festivals worldwide, including New Orleans Jazz & Heritage, Newport, Montreal, Monterey, Breda, and Kobe Jazz Festivals, as well as Carnegie Hall.[1][2][3] Her debut LP on Sony Masterworks won a Juno Award for Best Jazz Vocal Album and reached the Top 5 on Billboard jazz charts.[1][2] She has recorded on over 25 albums and released multiple studio albums, with her music garnering over 20 million streams online.[2] Beyond performance, Skonberg has been instrumental in music education, programming concerts and workshops for students of all ages through partnerships with Jazz at Lincoln Center, the Louis Armstrong House Museum, and Jazz House Kids, while also serving as a co-producer of the NY Hot Jazz Camp.[2]

Skonberg's musical style blends the earthiness and blues-rooted sensibilities of New Orleans jazz with contemporary modern jazz influences and world music elements, particularly a Spanish tinge derived from her extensive travels.[4] Her approach is characterized by a fiery, confident trumpet tone indebted to Louis Armstrong and a smooth, warm singing voice inspired by Anita O'Day.[1] She is a 10x Downbeat Rising Star, a recipient of the Legend Award by the Society for the Preservation of the Great American Songbook, and has earned numerous accolades including New York Bistro Awards, Hot House Jazz Magazine Awards, and the Jazz at Lincoln Center Swing Award.[2] As an active member of the Women in Jazz Organization and the International Trumpet Guild, and a Bach Conn-Selmer artist, Skonberg continues to be at the forefront of contemporary jazz while honoring its rich historical traditions.
