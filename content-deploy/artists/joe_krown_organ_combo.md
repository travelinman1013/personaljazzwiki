## Biography
Joe Krown is an American keyboardist specializing in New Orleans-style piano and Hammond B3 organ, based in New Orleans, Louisiana. In the 1980s, he relocated to Boston, formed his own band with his then-wife, and performed around New York and New England. During this period, he joined Chuck Berry's backup band, featuring drummer Tom Hambridge, touring the East Coast and backing 1950s doo-wop acts like The Platters, Marvelettes, and The Drifters.[1] In 1991, Krown moved to New Orleans to join Clarence 'Gatemouth' Brown's band, Gate's Express, serving as the keyboardist until Brown's death in 2005, recording four albums, and touring the U.S. and overseas, including as the opening act for Eric Clapton's 1995 world tour.[1][2][4]

The Joe Krown Organ Combo formed in 1999, featuring Krown on Hammond organ, guitarist Brint Anderson, saxophonist Brent Rose, drummer Mike Barras, and bassist Cassandra Faulconer. The group performed weekly at New Orleans venues like Maple Leaf Bar, House of Blues, Tipitina's, Le Bon Temps Roule, and dba, and made regular appearances at the French Quarter Festival since 1998 and New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival since 2001, with a European debut in 2001 at Ingolstadt Jazztage in Germany.[1][2][3] Krown released solo piano albums like 'Just The Piano...Just The Blues' (1997) and formed additional projects, including a trio with Johnny Sansone and John Fohl in 2000 (album in 2004), the Joe Krown Trio post-Hurricane Katrina in 2005, and a Hammond organ trio with Walter 'Wolfman' Washington and Russell Batiste, Jr. starting in 2007, releasing live and studio albums.[1][4] Since 2017, he has been the full-time keyboardist for the Kenny Wayne Shepherd band, touring worldwide while continuing local performances.[4][8]

Krown's musical style blends New Orleans piano traditions (influenced by slots once held by Professor Longhair and James Booker at Maple Leaf Bar from 1996-2001), blues, funk, boogie-woogie, and jazz. His groups have won multiple New Orleans Big Easy Awards (2000, 2004, 2009) and an OffBeat Award, cementing his legacy as a first-call organist and pianist in the Crescent City blues and funk scenes.[1][2][5]
