## Biography
Jacob Chung is a Canadian jazz saxophonist and composer born in 2000 who has emerged as one of the most promising voices in contemporary jazz. Based in Toronto before relocating to New York City in 2022, Chung represents a new generation of jazz musicians deeply committed to the post-war jazz tradition and swing idiom. His musical journey has been marked by significant recognition, including being a 2018 BMO National Scholar at the University of Toronto Faculty of Music, where he received the Norman and Joan Promane Jazz Scholarship twice (2019, 2020) and won the 2021 Jazz Arranging Prize. Early in his career, Chung garnered accolades including the 2021 Hnatyshyn Foundation Oscar Peterson Grant, the 2019 Prince Edward County Jazz Festival Rising Young Star Award, and acceptance into the 2018 National Youth Jazz Combo.

Chung's relocation to New York City in 2022 marked a pivotal moment in his career, as he sought mentorship from the legendary saxophonist Vincent Herring at Manhattan School of Music. Herring's advocacy for Chung's talent proved instrumental, leading to the recording of his sophomore album *The Sage* (2024) with the Cellar Music Group label, which was named one of the best Canadian jazz releases of 2024 by the Ottawa Citizen. His debut album *Epistle* (2022), released on Three Pines Records, was critically acclaimed for its embodiment of the spirit of jazz, with reviewers noting his "dynamic, blues-driven commitment to swing" and comparing his aesthetic direction to the 1990s neo-bop renaissance. In 2025, Chung released *Live at Frankie's Jazz Club*, recorded live in Vancouver with the Tyler Henderson Trio.

Chung's musical style is characterized by a straight-ahead approach to contemporary jazz that honors jazz history while maintaining a fresh, modern perspective. His work has drawn comparisons to jazz royalty such as Duke Ellington and Count Basie, with critics identifying him as part of a "second generation of Young Lions." Beyond his work as a bandleader, Chung maintains an active performance schedule at prestigious New York venues including The Django, Ornithology, Smalls, Mezzrow, and Dizzy's Club at Jazz at Lincoln Center. He has also appeared on the acclaimed livestream series "Emmet's Place" alongside pianist Emmet Cohen and special guest Kurt Elling in 2025, and performed at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts twice—first in 2023 with the Betty Carter Jazz Ahead program and again in 2024 with vibraphonist Chuck Redd.
