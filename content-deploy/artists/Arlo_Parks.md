## Biography
Arlo Parks, born Anaïs Oluwatoyin Estelle Marinho on August 9, 2000, in Hammersmith, West London, is an English singer, songwriter, and poet celebrated for her emotionally nuanced lyricism and genre-blending sound. Of Nigerian, Chadian, and French descent, Parks grew up speaking French before English and was raised in a culturally rich household. She began writing poetry at eight and taught herself guitar in her early teens, often creating music in her bedroom, somewhat isolated from the broader London music scene[1][3][6].

Parks first gained attention in 2018 by uploading demos to BBC Music Introducing, which led to her debut single "Cola" and subsequent signing with Transgressive Records. Her early EPs, 'Super Sad Generation' and 'Sophie,' showcased her blend of indie pop, R&B, folk, and bedroom pop, earning critical acclaim and a growing fanbase[2][5]. Her 2021 debut album, 'Collapsed in Sunbeams,' received widespread praise, peaking at number three on the UK Albums Chart and winning the Mercury Prize. Parks' introspective songwriting and gentle delivery have positioned her as a voice for her generation, addressing themes of identity, mental health, and belonging[1][2].

Her legacy is marked by her poetic approach to songwriting, openness about mental health, and her ability to connect with listeners through vulnerability and authenticity. Parks has become a prominent figure in contemporary British music, influencing both her peers and a new wave of artists with her honest storytelling and genre-fluid style[1][3].
