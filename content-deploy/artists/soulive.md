## Biography
Soulive is a renowned jazz/funk trio formed in Woodstock, New York, in 1999 by brothers Alan Evans (drums) and Neal Evans (Hammond B3 organ), along with guitarist Eric Krasno. Prior to Soulive, the Evans brothers played in Moon Boot Lover, while Krasno was involved with Lettuce, another influential funk band. Their initial jam session led to the recording of their debut album, 'Get Down!', quickly followed by 'Turn It Out,' which featured notable guest musicians and sold 65,000 copies, establishing their reputation in the jazz/funk scene.[1][2][3]

Soulive's career developed rapidly as they signed with Blue Note Records in 2000, releasing albums such as 'Doin' Something' and 'Next,' which included collaborations with artists like Dave Matthews, Black Thought, and Talib Kweli. The band became known for its energetic live performances, improvisational style, and ability to blend genres including jazz, funk, soul, and hip-hop. Their groove-driven approach, rooted in the soul jazz traditions of the 1960s and 1970s, appealed to a wide audience and led to tours across the United States, Europe, and Japan, as well as appearances at major festivals and opening slots for acts like The Rolling Stones and Dave Matthews Band.[1][2][3]

Over the years, Soulive continued to evolve, signing with Concord Records and later recording for the revived Stax label. Their discography features collaborations with a diverse array of artists, and the trio has maintained a reputation for pushing the boundaries of jazz fusion while staying true to their groove-based roots. Soulive's legacy lies in their innovative blending of genres, their influence on the modern jam band and jazz scenes, and their commitment to live performance as the heart of their artistic expression.[1][2][3][5]
