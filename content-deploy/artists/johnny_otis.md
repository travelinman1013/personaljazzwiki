## Biography
Johnny Otis, born John Alexander Veliotes on December 28, 1921, in Vallejo, California, was a pivotal figure in American rhythm and blues, rock and roll, and jazz blues. Raised in a predominantly African American neighborhood in Berkeley, Otis developed a deep affinity for Black culture and music, famously describing himself as 'Black by persuasion.' He began his musical journey as a drummer in local jazz and swing bands, later expanding his repertoire to piano and vibraphone. By the mid-1940s, Otis was leading his own band, achieving early success with the hit 'Harlem Nocturne' and establishing himself as a prominent bandleader and performer in Los Angeles.

Otis's career flourished in the postwar years as he became a renowned producer, talent scout, and promoter. He was instrumental in discovering and launching the careers of several legendary artists, including Etta James, Big Mama Thornton, Esther Phillips, and Hank Ballard. His own recordings, such as the 1958 hit 'Willie and the Hand Jive,' became rhythm and blues classics. Beyond music, Otis was a civil rights activist, author, radio and television host, and later an ordained minister. His influence extended across genres and generations, earning him induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994 and the Blues Foundation's Hall of Fame in 2000. Otis's legacy endures through his advocacy for racial equality and his foundational role in shaping American popular music.
