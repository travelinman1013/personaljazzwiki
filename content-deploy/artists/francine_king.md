## Biography
Francine King, widely recognized as Singing Francine, is a pioneering Trinidadian musical artist celebrated for her groundbreaking contributions to both calypso and the emerging genre of parang soca. Born in Trinidad and Tobago, Francine rose to prominence in the early 1970s, quickly establishing herself as one of the first women to achieve significant success in the male-dominated calypso arena. In 1972, she made history by becoming the first female to reach the Calypso King Finals, placing third with songs like 'Carnival Fever' and 'Happiness.' She repeated this feat in subsequent years, culminating in a second-place finish in 1975 with 'St Peter Say' and 'It’s A Shame,' which helped prompt the renaming of the competition to 'Calypso Monarch' in 1976. Her achievements earned her the Hummingbird Medal (Silver) in 1975, a national honor recognizing her impact on Trinidad and Tobago’s cultural landscape.

Beyond calypso, Francine played a crucial role in the development of parang soca, a fusion of traditional Venezuelan parang and soca music. Alongside Crazy, she became one of the genre’s principal standard bearers, releasing landmark albums such as 'From Christmas to Carnival' and 'Christmas is Love,' the latter being the first full-length parang soca album. Her music, characterized by festive melodies and socially conscious lyrics, resonated widely and helped popularize the genre beyond Trinidad’s borders. After a decade-long hiatus in New York, Francine returned to Trinidad and continued recording, founding her own label, Bonita Records, to maintain creative control over her work. Her legacy endures as a trailblazer for women in Caribbean music and a key architect of parang soca.
