## Biography
Paul Barbarin (born Adolphe Paul Barbarin, May 5, 1899, New Orleans, Louisiana) was a foundational figure in American jazz, especially within the New Orleans tradition. Raised in the musically rich Treme neighborhood, Barbarin was part of a renowned Creole family of musicians, including his father Isidore, a leader of the Onward Brass Band, and his brothers and nephew Danny Barker[1][2][4][6]. As a child, Barbarin began playing percussion on improvised instruments before acquiring his first drum kit as a teenager, quickly launching his professional career[3].

Barbarin's career spanned several major jazz hubs. He joined the Great Migration north to Chicago in 1917, working by day and performing by night with leading bands such as those led by Freddie Keppard and Jimmie Noone[2][3]. He made his recording debut with King Oliver's Dixie Syncopators in 1926, gaining national recognition[3]. Moving to New York in 1928, Barbarin played with Luis Russell's Orchestra, later supporting Louis Armstrong when Russell's band backed him[1][2]. He collaborated with Red Allen, Sidney Bechet, and Art Hodes, among others, and returned to New Orleans permanently in 1944, where he led his own bands and reformed the Onward Brass Band, remaining a central figure in the city's jazz scene until his death in 1969[1][2][4].

Barbarin's drumming style was deeply rooted in the New Orleans brass band tradition, synthesizing snare and bass drum rhythms with inventive cymbal and tom-tom work[4]. His compositions and performances helped define the sound of New Orleans jazz, and he was revered for his ability to blend the joyful, funky beats of street parades with the sophistication of ensemble jazz. Barbarin's legacy endures in the continued popularity of his songs and the influence he exerted on generations of jazz musicians[5].
