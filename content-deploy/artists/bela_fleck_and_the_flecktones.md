## Biography
Béla Fleck was born in 1958 in New York City and named after three great composers, destined from the start for musical excellence. He became fascinated by bluegrass music during his youth, inspired by the theme song of The Beverly Hillbillies performed by Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs. Beginning banjo at age 15 after receiving one as a gift, Fleck quickly became proficient and studied at New York's High School of Music and Art, where he privately studied banjo while experimenting with jazz and new techniques. Despite facing ridicule from fellow New Yorkers who associated the banjo with negative Southern stereotypes, he persisted, taking lessons from five-string banjo master Tony Trischka and studying jazz extensively, including attending a transformative concert by Return to Forever featuring Chick Corea and Stanley Clarke.

Fleck's professional career began in 1979 with his solo debut album Crossing the Tracks on Rounder Records. He subsequently performed with the Boston-based bluegrass band Tasty Licks, the Kentucky-based band Spectrum, and the progressive bluegrass group New Grass Revival (1981-1990), during which he also produced acclaimed solo albums including the groundbreaking Drive (1988). In 1988, Fleck assembled Béla Fleck & The Flecktones for a PBS performance on Lonesome Pine Special, initially intended as a one-off engagement. The original quartet—featuring Fleck on banjo, Howard Levy on harmonica and keyboards, Victor Wooten on bass, and Roy 'Futureman' Wooten on drums—discovered an immediate and deep musical connection, blending bluegrass, jazz, rock, rhythm and blues, and world music into a revolutionary sound dubbed "blu-bop."

The Flecktones released their self-financed self-titled debut in 1990, which attracted Warner Brothers Records' attention and became commercially successful. Though Levy departed in 1992 due to road fatigue, the group continued as a trio before saxophonist Jeff Coffin joined in 1997. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, the band released landmark albums including Flight of the Cosmic Hippo (1991), Left of Cool (1998), and the three-disc set Little Worlds (2003). Fleck's 2005 pilgrimage to sub-Saharan Africa, the birthplace of the banjo, resulted in the documentary Throw Down Your Heart (2008) and collaborations with Malian kora master Toumani Diabaté. The original Flecktones reunited for the Grammy Award-winning Rocket Science (2011) and celebrated their 30th anniversary with a North American tour in 2018. Fleck married clawhammer banjo player Abigail Washburn, with whom he frequently performs and records, releasing duet albums including Béla Fleck & Abigail Washburn (2014) and Echo in the Valley (2017). Recognized as one of the most inventive and commercially successful banjo players of the late 20th and early 21st centuries, Fleck revolutionized the banjo as a fully chromatic, universal instrument capable of playing complex jazz harmonies and odd time signatures.

## Fun Facts
- Fleck was named after three great composers—Béla (Bartók), likely referencing classical music's legacy, reflecting his parents' aspirations for his musical future.
- Despite being a virtuoso banjo player, Fleck faced ridicule from fellow New Yorkers who associated the banjo with negative Southern stereotypes from shows like Hee Haw and the film Deliverance, with people mocking him by flapping their arms and squealing like pigs.
- The Flecktones were originally assembled for what was intended as a one-off television performance on PBS' Lonesome Pine Special in 1988, but the immediate musical chemistry between the four musicians led to the formation of a permanent band that has lasted over three decades.
- Before Béla Fleck, no one played in odd time meters on banjo or treated it as a fully chromatic instrument, despite all the notes being available—Fleck fundamentally revolutionized how the banjo could be played and the genres it could accommodate.
