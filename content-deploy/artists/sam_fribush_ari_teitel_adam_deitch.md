## Biography
Sam Fribush, Ari Teitel, and Adam Deitch form the dynamic jazz-funk organ trio DTF, a group that merges vintage soul-jazz traditions with modern production and genre-blending innovation. The trio's roots trace back to New Orleans, where Fribush—a Greensboro native and New England Conservatory graduate—first connected musically with Detroit-born Teitel during performances at a local church. Fribush quickly established himself as a rising star on the Hammond organ, collaborating with artists like Charlie Hunter and Hiss Golden Messenger, and is known for his ability to fuse gospel, jazz, and contemporary grooves.

Ari Teitel, a founding member of The Rumble and a regular with New Orleans funk stalwarts Dumpstaphunk, brings a genre-defying guitar style shaped by Detroit's vibrant music scene and deep immersion in R&B, funk, gospel, jazz, and hip-hop. Adam Deitch, acclaimed globally as a drummer and producer, is best known as a founding member of funk band Lettuce and the electronic duo Break Science. Deitch's extensive credits include collaborations with John Scofield, Talib Kweli, and Pretty Lights, and his signature blend of jazz, funk, and hip-hop underpins the trio's rhythmic drive.

Their debut album, recorded live to tape at Colorado Sound Studios and released in May 2025, features original compositions and inventive covers, such as The Allman Brothers' "Midnight Rider" and Bel Biv DeVoe’s "Poison." The trio’s sound is characterized by its nostalgic homage to classic '60s and '70s organ trios, while pushing boundaries with modern, beat-driven sensibilities. DTF’s work is celebrated for its deep grooves, improvisational interplay, and a unique ability to make classic forms feel fresh and relevant for contemporary audiences.
