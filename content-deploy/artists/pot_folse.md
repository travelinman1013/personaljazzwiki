## Biography
Gatewood “Pott” Folse, affectionately known as 'Uncle Pott,' was born on June 12, 1925, in Raceland, Louisiana, a town situated about 40 miles from New Orleans[5][1]. He began playing piano at the age of seven and quickly developed a passion for music, mastering several instruments over his lifetime, including piano, guitar, and accordion[5][6]. Folse started his professional career in 1940 with Professor Wilson's twelve-piece orchestra, the Star Serenaders, performing foxtrots and waltzes[2].

Throughout his career, Folse became a beloved figure in the Houma-Thibodaux region, entertaining generations at festivals, dances, and community gatherings[3][4]. His musical style is rooted in Cajun and zydeco traditions, but he was known for blending genres, incorporating country, 1950s rock, and French influences into his performances[1]. Folse often performed with his daughters, Debbie and Wendy, and was recognized for his ability to adapt and keep Cajun music vibrant and accessible to younger audiences[1][4].

Folse's legacy is marked by his dedication to family, community, and the preservation of Cajun culture. He remained active as a musician well into his nineties, inspiring both audiences and fellow musicians with his energy and love for music[4][6]. Folse's influence is felt in the continued vitality of Cajun music in southern Louisiana, where he is remembered not only for his musical talent but also for his generosity and service to others[3].
