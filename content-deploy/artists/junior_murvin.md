## Biography
Junior Murvin, born Murvin Junior Smith circa 1946 in Port Antonio, Jamaica, became one of reggae's most distinctive vocalists, known for his striking falsetto voice. He began his musical journey after his family relocated to Montego Bay during his youth, where he attended Montego Bay Technical High School and performed in local stage shows. His early recording career started in 1966 under the name Junior Soul, recording for Sonia Pottinger's Gayfeet label with tracks like "Miss Kushie," "Slipping," and "Jennifer." Throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s, Murvin performed with several live bands including the Hippy Boys (alongside Max Romeo), the Mighty Falcons (which featured Dennis Brown), and the Young Experience Band, playing the hotel circuit and Kingston clubs while honing his craft.

Murvin's breakthrough came in 1976 when he recorded "Police and Thieves" with legendary producer Lee "Scratch" Perry, with the rhythm laid by Boris Gardner, Sly Dunbar, and Ernest Ranglin. The song became an international hit, particularly resonating in the UK following the unrest at the 1976 Notting Hill Carnival, and was famously covered by punk band The Clash and later by Boy George. Following this success, Murvin recorded extensively throughout the 1980s with various producers including Joe Gibbs and Errol Thompson (the Mighty Two), Henry "Junjo" Lawes, and Prince Jammy, releasing albums such as "Bad Man Posse" (1982), "Muggers In The Street" (1985), and "Apartheid" (1986). His career spanned multiple decades with continued recording work through the late 1980s and beyond, maintaining his profile as a veteran reggae artist.

Junior Murvin passed away on December 2, 2013, leaving behind a legacy as a pioneering reggae vocalist whose distinctive falsetto and collaborations with reggae's most innovative producers helped shape the genre's sound. His influence extended beyond reggae into punk and alternative music, demonstrating the universal appeal of his artistry and the enduring impact of "Police and Thieves" on global popular music.

## Fun Facts
- Junior Murvin wrote the song 'Solomon' for Derrick Harriott while smoking, composing the entire track in about five minutes after the inspiration came to him.
- His distinctive stage name 'Junior Murvin' was suggested independently by both Derrick Harriott and Lee 'Scratch' Perry, coincidentally settling the matter when he needed a name change because another Junior Soul was based in New York.
- The song 'Cool Out Son' originated from a casual piece of advice Murvin gave to a downhearted guitarist in one of his touring bands: 'patient man ride donkey,' which inspired the entire composition.
- Police and Thieves gained particular prominence in the UK following the unrest at the heavily policed 1976 Notting Hill Carnival, demonstrating how reggae music could capture and reflect social and political moments in real time.
