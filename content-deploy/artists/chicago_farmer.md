## Biography
Chicago Farmer is the stage name of Illinois singer-songwriter Cody Diekhoff, a working‑class folk and Americana artist known for his vivid storytelling, sharp social observation, and deep connection to Midwestern life.[1][2][6] Raised in the tiny farming town of Delavan, Illinois (population under 2,000), he grew up in a family with farming grandparents whose values of hard work and humility became the bedrock of his songs.[1][2] As a teenager he gravitated first to punk and grunge before a friend’s father introduced him to Hank Williams, and soon after to John Prine and Woody Guthrie, artists who redirected him toward narrative‑driven, acoustic folk.[1][2][4][8]

Performing under the name Chicago Farmer, originally conceived as a band moniker, Diekhoff began logging extensive stage and highway time across the Midwest and beyond, eventually settling in Chicago in 2003 to pursue music full‑time.[1][2][6] Over more than two decades he has crisscrossed the United States playing small towns, big cities, and rural communities, building a reputation as a consummate storyteller whose songs speak directly to working people putting in long hours in factories, farms, and service jobs.[2][6] His style blends folk, alt‑country, bluegrass and Americana, pairing plain‑spoken, often humorous lyrics with compassion for everyday struggles and a clear-eyed take on economic and social realities, leading admirers to place him in the lineage of John Prine, Arlo Guthrie, and Ramblin’ Jack Elliott.[1][2]

Chicago Farmer’s music is rooted in the tension and harmony between his small‑town upbringing and his adopted big‑city home—what he calls “small town roots, tilled with city streets mentality.”[1][2] Across a catalog of independently released albums and constant touring, he has cultivated a loyal regional following and become a voice for Midwestern working‑class experience, performing both solo and with his band The Fieldnotes.[2][5][6] While still a largely grassroots figure, his songs and live performances have earned praise from peers and audiences for their honesty, warmth, and the sense of community they create, reinforcing his status as a modern Midwestern folk troubadour.[1][2][5][6]
