## Biography
Mark Ronson, a British musician, producer, and DJ, is renowned for his genre-blending productions and collaborations with artists like Amy Winehouse, Lady Gaga, and Bruno Mars. Raye, born Rachel Agatha Keen, is a British singer-songwriter celebrated for her soulful vocals and expressive lyricism, rising from behind-the-scenes songwriting to chart-topping solo success. In 2025, Ronson and Raye united for their first official collaboration, releasing the single 'Suzanne' through Sony Music UK. The partnership was catalyzed by their shared role as ambassadors for Swiss luxury watchmaker Audemars Piguet, who invited them to participate in the APxMusic program for the brand’s 150th anniversary. Their creative process involved intensive, all-night sessions across London, New York, and Los Angeles, resulting in a track that fuses Ronson’s signature jazz-inflected, feel-good beats with Raye’s emotive storytelling and vocal prowess. The song’s release was accompanied by a music video showcasing their studio synergy and live performances, and it quickly charted in the UK, reflecting both artists’ broad appeal and mutual admiration. Raye’s journey to this collaboration was marked by her early work in Ronson’s London studio, where she honed her songwriting craft and dreamed of working with him. Their joint effort on 'Suzanne' and the soundtrack piece 'Grandma Calls the Boy Bad News' for the film F1 highlights a meeting of musical minds, blending influences from jazz, pop, and soul, and underscoring their legacy as innovators in contemporary British music.
