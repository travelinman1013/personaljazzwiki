## Biography
Archie Shepp, born May 24, 1937, in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and raised in Philadelphia, began his musical journey studying piano and saxophone before attending Goddard College, earning a B.A. in 1959. He launched his professional career in New York City, joining avant-garde pianist Cecil Taylor's quartet from 1960-1962, which marked his entry into free jazz. Early collaborations included recordings with Taylor and trumpeter Bill Dixon, leading to the formation of the New York Contemporary Five in 1963 with John Tchicai, Don Cherry, and others, touring Europe and releasing key albums.[1][2][3][4]

Shepp's style evolved in the 1960s through Impulse! Records releases like *Four for Trane* (1964), *Fire Music* (1965), and *The Magic of Ju-Ju* (1967), blending free-form avant-garde jazz with African rhythms, gruff tenor saxophone tones, wide vibrato, screams, and multiphonics influenced by John Coltrane and Ben Webster. His Afrocentric approach addressed African-American identity, seen in works like *Ascension* (1965) with Coltrane. In 1969, he began teaching ethnomusicology at the University at Buffalo and later the University of Massachusetts Amherst from 1971-2002, while continuing to record over 110 albums, co-founding ArchieBall in 2004, and earning NEA Jazz Master status in 2016.[1][2][3][4][5]

Shepp's legacy spans free jazz innovation, education in African-American music history, and ongoing performances incorporating rap and hip-hop, as in *Ocean Bridges* (2020). He remains a pivotal figure bridging avant-garde experimentation with cultural activism and mainstream jazz.[1][3][6]
