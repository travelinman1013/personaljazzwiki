## Biography
William Edward "Eddie" Kirkland Jr. was born on December 16, 1981, in Tarrant, Texas, to Dr. William Edward Kirkland Sr., a pastor, and Donna Anne Kirkland. Growing up as the son of a Florida pastor, Eddie had worship music in his DNA from an early age. He was raised in Jacksonville, Florida, where his formative years were shaped by evangelical church culture and contemporary Christian music. He has two younger brothers, Christopher and Kyle.

Kirkland's career took a significant turn when he relocated to Atlanta, Georgia, to become the worship pastor at North Point Community Church, one of the largest evangelical megachurches in the United States led by Andy Stanley. He served in this influential role for more than five years, leading worship and developing his craft in contemporary Christian music. During this time, he released his first music recordings, beginning with the album "Orthadoxy" in 2008, followed by the EP "Here + Now" on October 14, 2011, and the studio album "Kings & Queens" on August 14, 2012, both through North Point Music. While at North Point, Kirkland pursued his dream of creating a presence in the Christian music marketplace, but eventually realized his true calling was working with people and helping them find freedom in Christ rather than pursuing musical celebrity.

In a dramatic shift, Kirkland left his comfortable position at the megachurch to plant an Anglican church, inspired by his earlier experiences studying in England during college where he worshipped at Anglican churches including Christ Church Cathedral. The liturgy had stirred something deep in his heart, and he had continued practicing the Daily Office using a Book of Common Prayer even while serving in evangelical contexts. He founded The Parish Anglican Church in Alpharetta, Georgia (just outside Atlanta) with the Diocese of Churches for the Sake of Others (C4SO) in partnership with the Diocese of the South. The church primarily serves young families from local suburbs, many of whom come from non-Anglican backgrounds or have been "de-churched." As an Anglican priest and pastor, Kirkland continues to lead worship but within the framework of liturgical tradition, finding freedom in the fact that the success of worship no longer depends on his musical performance but on the Gospel preached through Word, liturgy, and sacraments.

## Fun Facts
- Kirkland studied abroad in England during his college years, where he worshipped at Christ Church Cathedral and other Anglican churches—experiences that planted the seeds for his eventual conversion to Anglicanism years later.
- The day after telling his wife about leaving North Point, Kirkland experienced a remarkable series of divine confirmations: he had a meeting with Graham Kendrick who had just met with Anglican worship leaders, received an email from a C4SO church planting team member who had grown up in Atlanta, and had a friend introduce him to Anglican church planters—all within a short span of time.
- Despite achieving his dream of breaking into the Christian music marketplace while at North Point Community Church, Kirkland realized it wasn't what he truly wanted and left it all behind to plant a church, finding greater fulfillment in pastoral ministry than musical performance.
- Kirkland purchased a Book of Common Prayer and began practicing the Daily Office even while serving as worship leader at the evangelical megachurch, secretly nurturing his Anglican spirituality years before making the public transition.
