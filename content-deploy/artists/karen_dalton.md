## Biography
Karen Dalton (July 19, 1937 – March 19, 1993) was an American folk and blues singer, guitarist, and banjo player whose idiosyncratic phrasing and raw, haunted tone made her a cult figure of the 1960s Greenwich Village scene. Born in Enid, Oklahoma, she grew up in a working‑class family and taught herself 12‑string guitar, long‑neck banjo, and other instruments, reportedly able to pick up almost anything she touched.[2][3] As a teenager she married twice and had two children; after her second divorce around age 21 she left Oklahoma, spending time in Kansas City, San Francisco, and Cambridge, Massachusetts before heading to New York at the dawn of the 1960s folk revival.[1][2][3] In the Village she became known as an unusually “authentic” folk voice with deep roots in traditional American music, curating a personal repertoire of Appalachian songs, blues, and jazz standards that she had been collecting since childhood.[1][3][4]

Dalton quickly embedded herself in the Greenwich Village folk community, sharing stages and informal sessions with Tim Hardin, Fred Neil, Bob Dylan, Dave Van Ronk, John Sebastian, and members of the Holy Modal Rounders.[1][2][4][6] Although often compared to Billie Holiday for her timbre, Dalton saw herself as a “song stylist,” drawing as much from blues legend Bessie Smith as from jazz and country sources, and reshaping others’ material through elastic timing, rough‑edged tone, and emotionally unguarded delivery.[4] Deeply ambivalent about the music industry, she rarely agreed to record and preferred intimate living‑room performances with friends.[3] Her reluctance meant that she released only two studio albums in her lifetime—the spare folk‑blues set “It’s So Hard to Tell Who’s Going to Love You the Best” (1969) and the more expansive “In My Own Time” (1971)—both recorded largely in single takes and both commercial failures on release.[2][3][5] After the disappointment of her second album, Dalton gradually withdrew from public life, struggling with addiction and poverty; she died in Woodstock, New York, in 1993 from AIDS‑related complications at age 55.[2][5]

In the decades since her death, Dalton’s reputation has grown from near‑obscurity to that of a foundational, if under‑recognized, figure in American folk. Fellow musicians long regarded her as a “singer’s singer”: Bob Dylan called her his favorite singer in the Village and remembered her voice as akin to Billie Holiday’s, while bandmate Peter Stampfel described her as the only folksinger he knew with a genuinely “folk” background who came to the scene entirely under her own steam.[1][4][6] Posthumous releases of home and live recordings—along with the documentary “Karen Dalton: In My Own Time”—have revealed more of her repertoire and reinforced her status as a key voice of what critic Greil Marcus called the “Old Weird America,” connecting 1960s folk revivalism to older currents of blues, balladry, and frontier song.[3][5] Contemporary artists such as Joanna Newsom, Devendra Banhart, Courtney Barnett, and Nick Cave have cited her as an influence, and her intense readings of songs like “Katie Cruel,” “Little Bit of Rain,” and “It’s Alright” are now regarded as definitive interpretations that helped shape a more personal, emotionally unvarnished approach to folk performance.[2][3][4]

## Fun Facts
- Bob Dylan, who knew Karen Dalton from the Greenwich Village folk circuit, later wrote that she had a voice like Billie Holiday and played guitar like bluesman Jimmy Reed, calling her his “favorite singer in the place.”[4][6]
- Dalton strongly resisted the music industry and is reported to have been so reluctant to record that friends and producers effectively had to trick or pressure her into making her 1969 debut album, which was largely cut in single takes.[1][3][5]
- Although she is often remembered for just two studio albums, posthumous issues of live tapes and home recordings—such as the material later released as “Cotton Eyed Joe” and “Green Rocky Road”—have revealed that she played a far wider and deeper repertoire than her official discography suggests.[1][3]
- Some listeners and writers believe Dalton was the inspiration for the character “Katie” in Bob Dylan and The Band’s song “Katie’s Been Gone” from “The Basement Tapes,” adding to her mystique within 1960s folk lore, though this remains speculative rather than documented fact.[3][4]

## Musical Connections

### Mentors/Influences
- [[bessie_smith|Bessie Smith]] - Major vocal and stylistic influence; Dalton cited Smith as a more important influence than Billie Holiday despite frequent comparisons to Holiday by others. (General influence on Dalton’s blues phrasing and repertoire; Dalton recorded blues and jazz standards such as “God Bless the Child.”) [Influence rooted in Dalton’s formative years and evident throughout her 1960s–1970s recordings.[4]]
- [[billie_holiday|Billie Holiday]] - Not a direct mentor but a key stylistic reference point; critics and peers repeatedly compared Dalton’s timbre, vulnerability, and phrasing to Holiday’s. (Dalton cut a version of Holiday’s composition “God Bless the Child” in a 1966 session, underscoring the stylistic link.) [Comparisons common throughout her performing and recording career in the 1960s–1970s and in later criticism.[1][4]]
- [[traditional_american_folk_and_blues_oklahoma_roots|Traditional American folk and blues (Oklahoma roots)]] - Dalton was deeply shaped by the traditional songs she absorbed and collected from childhood in Oklahoma, forming the core of her repertoire. (Traditional pieces like “Katie Cruel” and other folk and blues standards that she later recorded and performed.) [Childhood through early adulthood; material continued to inform her 1960s–1970s performances and recordings.[1][3][4]]

### Key Collaborators
- [[tim_hardin|Tim Hardin]] - Close musical associate in the pre‑60s and Village folk scenes; part of an informal songwriting and performing circle and once member of her group The Trio. (Performed together in Greenwich Village clubs; Hardin played guitar in her short‑lived group The Trio.) [Late 1950s pre‑60s folk era through early‑mid 1960s.[1][2][4]]
- [[fred_neil|Fred Neil]] - Regular fellow performer on the Village circuit; Dalton often covered his songs, adding her own stylistic stamp. (Her bluesy rendition of Neil’s “Little Bit of Rain” became one of her standout interpretations.) [Early–mid 1960s during the Greenwich Village folk scene.[2][4]]
- [[bob_dylan|Bob Dylan]] - Peer and occasional accompanist in Greenwich Village; Dylan admired Dalton’s singing and sometimes backed her on harmonica. (Shared stages at Café Wha? and other Village venues; Dylan later wrote about her as his “favorite singer in the place” in his memoir.) [Early 1960s Village folk era.[1][2][4][6]]
- [[richard_tucker|Richard Tucker]] - Bassist, bandmate, and husband; part of her group The Trio and later duet partner on early recordings. (Member of The Trio; played on home and early sessions such as material later issued on “Green Rocky Road” (1966 recordings).) [Early–mid 1960s, including their marriage and musical partnership.[1]]
- [[peter_stampfel_holy_modal_rounders|Peter Stampfel (Holy Modal Rounders)]] - Friend and fellow musician from the folk underground who championed her authenticity and background. (No widely cited formal studio collaborations, but he played with her in the same scene and later wrote influential appreciations of her work.) [1960s folk era and subsequent critical reappraisal.[1][3]]

### Artists Influenced
- [[joanna_newsom|Joanna Newsom]] - Cited Dalton as an influence; Newsom’s own intricate, idiosyncratic vocal phrasing and reimagining of folk traditions echo Dalton’s example. (Influence noted broadly in Newsom’s folk‑derived albums rather than one specific track.) [2000s–2010s, as Dalton’s catalog was rediscovered and championed by the freak‑folk and indie‑folk scenes.[4]]
- [[devendra_banhart|Devendra Banhart]] - A leading figure in the 2000s freak‑folk movement who has named Dalton as an inspiration, particularly for her unvarnished, intimate approach. (General stylistic influence across his early folk‑leaning albums.) [2000s onward, coinciding with Dalton’s posthumous revival.[4]]
- [[nick_cave|Nick Cave]] - Has cited Dalton as an influence; critics have linked the mood and narrative of Cave’s “When I First Came To Town” to Dalton’s life and persona. (“When I First Came To Town” from Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds’ 1992 album “Henry’s Dream,” which has been associated thematically with Dalton.) [Early 1990s and later reflections on influences.[4]]
- [[courtney_barnett|Courtney Barnett]] - Named among contemporary artists influenced by Dalton’s interpretive intensity and off‑kilter phrasing. (Broad aesthetic and interpretive influence rather than a single cover or tribute.) [2010s, in the wake of Dalton’s growing cult status.[4]]
