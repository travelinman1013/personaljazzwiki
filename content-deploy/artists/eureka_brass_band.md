## Biography
The Eureka Brass Band was one of the most influential and enduring traditional New Orleans brass bands, founded around 1920 by trumpeter Willie Wilson. Over the decades, the band became a fixture in New Orleans, performing at countless parades, funerals, and social events, embodying the vibrant second line tradition that is central to the city's musical identity. Leadership of the band passed through several hands, including trumpeter Alcide Landry, sousaphonist Joseph “Red” Clark, Dominique “T-Boy” Remy, and finally Percy Humphrey, who led the group from 1946 until its disbandment in 1975[1][5]. The band’s first recordings were made in 1951 and 1956, capturing the raw, ensemble-driven sound that characterized early jazz and brass band music in New Orleans[1].

Musically, the Eureka Brass Band was known for its robust, collective improvisation and rhythmic drive, featuring a classic lineup of trumpets, trombones, clarinets, saxophones, sousaphone, and drums. Their style preserved the essence of early jazz, with a focus on ensemble playing rather than individual solos, and their repertoire included funeral dirges, parade tunes, and lively dance numbers. The band played a crucial role in maintaining and transmitting the traditional brass band sound during a period when newer musical styles threatened to overshadow these roots[1][5].

The legacy of the Eureka Brass Band extends far beyond its recordings and performances. As one of the last bands to carry on the older New Orleans brass band traditions, it served as a bridge between generations of musicians. The band’s influence can be heard in the work of later groups such as the Olympia Brass Band and the Treme Brass Band, and its members mentored many younger musicians who would go on to shape the sound of New Orleans jazz and brass band music in the latter half of the 20th century[2].
