## Biography
Antônio Carlos Jobim, affectionately known as 'Tom,' was born on January 25, 1927, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Growing up near the beaches and lush landscapes of Rio, Jobim was immersed in the rhythms of Brazilian samba and the harmonies of European classical music, drawing early inspiration from composers like Debussy and Ravel as well as Brazilian musicians such as Pixinguinha. He began studying piano and harmony in his youth and started his professional career playing piano in bars and nightclubs in Rio de Janeiro in the 1940s, later working as an arranger at Continental Studio in the early 1950s. His first composition to be recorded was 'Incerteza' in 1953, with lyrics by Newton Mendonça.

Jobim became a primary force behind the creation of bossa nova, a genre that fused samba rhythms with cool jazz harmonies and a relaxed, sophisticated feel. In the late 1950s, his collaboration with poet Vinicius de Moraes produced the music for the play Orfeu da Conceição, later adapted into the Oscar-winning film Black Orpheus (1959), whose soundtrack Jobim co-wrote with Luiz Bonfá and helped launch bossa nova internationally. The genre’s breakthrough came with João Gilberto’s 1958 recording of Jobim’s 'Chega de Saudade' and 'Desafinado,' and later with the landmark 1964 album Getz/Gilberto, featuring Stan Getz, João Gilberto, and Astrud Gilberto, whose hit 'The Girl from Ipanema' brought Jobim global fame. Jobim’s lush harmonies, poetic melodies, and signature bossa nova sound made him one of the most celebrated songwriters of the 20th century, and his music remains a cornerstone of Brazilian music, jazz, and world music.
