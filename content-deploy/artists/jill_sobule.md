## Biography
Jill Sobule (1959-2025) was a Denver-born singer-songwriter who became one of the most influential pop-folk vocalists of her generation. She began her recording career in 1990 with her debut album "Things Here Are Different" and achieved widespread recognition in the mid-1990s with her hit singles "Supermodel" (featured in the 1995 film Clueless) and "I Kissed a Girl," which became the first overtly gay-themed song to crack the Billboard Top 20—13 years before Katy Perry's song of the same title. Despite being banned on several southern radio stations, the song's success marked a groundbreaking moment for LGBTQ+ representation in mainstream pop music during a time when being openly queer was considered a career liability.

Throughout her 35-year career, Sobule released 12 albums that tackled complex social and political issues including the death penalty, anorexia nervosa, reproductive rights, mental health, and LGBTQ+ issues. Her songwriting approach was deeply narrative-driven, with stories forming the foundation of her compositions. She was known for her vulnerable live performances, often performing without a set list and "winging it" during shows. Sobule became a pioneer in independent music and crowdfunding, raising nearly $90,000 from fans in 2008 to finance her album "California Years" when major record labels dropped her and indie labels went bankrupt. She subsequently launched her own indie label, Pinko Records, releasing "Dottie's Charms" (2014) and "Nostalgia Kills" (2018).

Beyond music, Sobule was a fierce human rights activist and theatrical artist. She created an autobiographical off-Broadway musical that premiered at the Wild Project in New York in 2022, starred in a true-crime musical at LA's Geffen Playhouse in 2022, and developed a pulpy riot grrrl adaptation of "The Scarlet Letter" titled "Crimson Lit: Scarlet Letter Setlist." She performed with iconic artists including Neil Young, Billy Bragg, and Cyndi Lauper, and inducted Neil Diamond into the Songwriter's Hall of Fame. Sobule died on May 1, 2025, at age 66, in a house fire while on tour in Minnesota, leaving behind a remarkable legacy as a trailblazer in socially conscious music and an inspiration to countless independent musicians.

## Fun Facts
- Sobule was a pioneer in crowdfunding for musicians, raising nearly $90,000 from fans in 2008 to finance her album "California Years"—years before Kickstarter became commonplace. The founders of Kickstarter later asked her for advice on the platform.
- She performed as herself singing a song on an episode of "The Simpsons" in 2019, marking her appearance in one of television's most iconic animated series.
- During an interview at Chicago's Double Door in August 1995, Sobule had thrown her back out the previous day and was diagnosed with a herniated disc, yet she still performed as the opening act for legendary punk band X while lying on a fabulous 1950s sofa for comfort.
- "I Kissed a Girl" predated Katy Perry's song of the same title by 13 years and was the first overtly gay-themed song to reach the Billboard Top 20, making it a groundbreaking achievement in 1995 when being openly LGBTQ+ was considered a career-ending move in the music industry.
