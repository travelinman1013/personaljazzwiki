## Biography
Varetta Mamie Dillard (February 3, 1933 – October 4, 1993) was a prominent American rhythm and blues singer in the 1950s, best known for her chart-topping hit "Mercy, Mr. Percy." Born in Harlem, New York City, Dillard grew up in a musically inclined family, with parents who were avid dancers. After her father's early death, she and her mother lived with her grandmother in Manhattan. Dillard's musical journey began in earnest when she twice won the Apollo Theater's amateur night competition, impressing audiences with her powerful, gospel-tinged voice and her ability to emulate her idol, Ruth Brown.

Discovered by Savoy Records' Lee Magid while still in high school, Dillard recorded her first session in 1951. She quickly became known for her dynamic stage presence and versatile vocal style, which blended elements of boogie-woogie, swing, and early rock and roll. Her biggest commercial success came with "Mercy, Mr. Percy" in 1953, which reached #6 on the R&B charts and established her as a leading lady of the genre. Dillard continued to record for Savoy and later RCA Victor, collaborating with notable musicians and performing alongside acts like Wynonie Harris and the Joe Thomas Combo. Despite her talent, she never achieved the widespread fame of contemporaries like Ruth Brown or LaVern Baker, but she left behind a respected body of work and influenced the development of R&B and early rock and roll.

Dillard's career waned by the late 1950s, and she eventually left the music industry, later working outside of show business. Nevertheless, her contributions to R&B, particularly as a pioneering female artist in a male-dominated field, have been recognized by music historians. Her recordings remain valued by collectors and aficionados of 1950s rhythm and blues.
