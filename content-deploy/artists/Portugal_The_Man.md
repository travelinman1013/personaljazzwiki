## Biography
Portugal. The Man is an experimental indie rock band formed in 2004 in Wasilla, Alaska, by founding members John Baldwin Gourley and Zachary Scott Carothers, both formerly of the band Anatomy of a Ghost. Frontman John Gourley's upbringing profoundly shaped the band's unique sound—he was raised in a log cabin home powered by a generator with no telephone on the fringes of Wasilla, where his parents worked as dog sled mushers in the winter wasteland of seasonal darkness and perpetual cold. This technological isolation, combined with Gourley's fascination with science fiction and experiences of homelessness, created the foundation for the band's distinctly transcendent and abstract musical approach. The band eventually relocated to Portland, Oregon, where they remain based today.

The band released their debut album *Waiter: You Vultures!* through Fearless Records in January 2006, followed by *Church Mouth* in 2007. Over the years, Portugal. The Man has experienced several lineup changes but currently consists of founding members Gourley and Carothers, along with Gourley's wife Zoe Manville (backup vocals/percussion, joined 2008), guitarist Eric Howk (joined 2015), drummer Jason Sechrist (joined 2005), and keyboardist Kyle O'Quin (joined 2007, formerly of Gatsby's American Dream). The band achieved mainstream breakthrough success with their 2017 single "Feel It Still," which reached number four on the charts and earned them a Grammy Award in 2018 for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance, along with two number-one hits on Alternative Radio.

Portugal. The Man has released nine studio albums, with their latest, *Chris Black Changed My Life*, arriving in July 2023. The album was inspired by and dedicated to their longtime friend Chris Black, a filmmaker who passed away in May 2019. The album chronicles the band's turbulent years following the success of "Feel It Still," including navigating a global pandemic, Gourley suffering a broken jaw, his and Zoe's daughter Frances being diagnosed with a rare neurodegenerative genetic disease, and band members Howk, Carothers, and O'Quin battling different addictions. Known for their visceral live shows that differ wildly from night to night and their deep connection with fans through personalized artwork and intimate interactions, Portugal. The Man has transcended scene restrictions to create music unparalleled in its ambition and uniqueness, performing at major festivals including Bonnaroo and Lollapalooza.

## Fun Facts
- The band recorded part of Chris Black Changed My Life at a Portland studio started by Nike SB visionary Sandy Bodecker that has its own skate park, fulfilling a childhood dream for Gourley who was heavily influenced by skate and snowboarding films.
- Chris Black, the filmmaker for whom their 2023 album is named, was originally brought on tour after director AG Rojas suggested it, though the band initially wasn't sure what role he would fill. Black ended up DJing and introducing shows with his 'anti-rockstar' banter, bringing a unique energy to their performances before his death in 2019.
- Songwriter Paul Williams, known for writing hits for Three Dog Night and The Carpenters in the 1970s and his recent work with Daft Punk, directly messaged the band after meeting them briefly at the American Music Awards asking to collaborate, leading to a three-day session in Portland.
- The band used a 'Tupac approach' for their latest album, bringing in all their friends and passing around the mic, recruiting an eclectic mix that included everyone from Journey drummer Steve Smith to former Michael Jackson backing vocalist Dorian Holley to The Last Artful, Dodgr.
