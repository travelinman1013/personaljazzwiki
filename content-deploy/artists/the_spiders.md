## Biography
The Spiders were a pioneering Mexican rock band founded in Guadalajara, Mexico, in 1960, originally under the name 'Los Spiders'[1]. The founding lineup included Manuel Olivera (bass), Guillermo Olivera (drums), 'Chon' Cortés (keyboards), Carlos de Regil (vocals), and Reynaldo Díaz Vélez, known as 'El Tuky' (guitar)[1]. The group began performing in local cafés and school events, quickly becoming a fixture in Guadalajara's burgeoning rock scene, and later played at prominent venues such as the Círculo Francés, Casino Español, and the Hilton Hotel[1]. Their early sound was rooted in rock and roll, but by the late 1960s, they embraced the psychedelic rock wave, blending it with pop and Latin influences—a style that set them apart from the garage rock bands common in South America at the time[2]. Their 1970 single 'Back' became a local radio hit, and they released several albums throughout the 1970s, including 'Back' (1969), 'Nuevas Rutas en Sonido' (1973), and 'Corre, corre' (1980)[1]. Despite lineup changes over the years, The Spiders remained active, reuniting for special concerts and recording a live album with La Fachada de Piedra in 1993[1]. The band is remembered as one of the key groups of the Avándaro-era Mexican rock movement, leaving a lasting legacy in the country's rock history[2][3].

## Fun Facts
- The Spiders' first recording, 'Por Tu Amor,' was released on a 45 rpm vinyl EP in Spanish, reflecting the early rock en español movement in Mexico[1].
- After nearly 40 years apart, the original members reunited for a private concert in 2007, reviving classic songs like 'Hi oh Silver' and 'Back'—this marked the last performance of guitarist Reynaldo Díaz Vélez, who passed away a month later[1].
- The band's name was originally 'Los Spiders' before being anglicized to 'The Spiders,' a common practice among Mexican rock bands of the era seeking a more international appeal[1].
- Despite their psychedelic rock reputation, The Spiders avoided drifting into progressive rock, maintaining a focus on guitar- and organ-driven pop-rock with Latin flavors[2].
