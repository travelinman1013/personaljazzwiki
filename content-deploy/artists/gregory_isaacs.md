## Biography
Gregory Anthony Isaacs OD (15 July 1951 – 25 October 2010) was a Jamaican reggae singer and songwriter, born in the tough inner-city community of Fletchers Land, Kingston, Jamaica.[1][2] As a teenager he honed his craft on Jamaica’s competitive talent-show circuit, making an early recording in 1968 under the name Winston Sinclair for producer Byron Lee, before briefly joining the vocal trio The Concords.[1][2] When that group split, Isaacs co‑founded the African Museum label and record shop with singer Errol Dunkley in the early 1970s, giving him an independent platform in the burgeoning reggae scene.[1][2][3] His self-produced singles such as “My Only Lover” (often cited as the first lovers rock record), “Sinner Man,” “Mr. Cop,” “All I Have Is Love,” and “Love Is Overdue” quickly established him as one of Jamaica’s most prolific and popular artists, blending socially conscious roots themes with intimate, romantic material.[1][2][3]

By the late 1970s Isaacs was a major reggae star, working with leading producers like Alvin Ranglin (GG’s), Lee “Scratch” Perry, and the duo Sly & Robbie, and touring the United States and United Kingdom alongside contemporaries such as Dennis Brown and Bob Marley.[1][2][3] Nicknamed **“The Cool Ruler”** for his smooth, seductive vocal delivery and unruffled stage presence, he signed to Virgin’s Front Line imprint and later to Charisma and Island Records, releasing key albums including *Cool Ruler*, *Soon Forward*, *The Lonely Lover*, *More Gregory*, and especially *Night Nurse* (1982), whose title track became his signature song and introduced him to a broader international audience.[1][2][3] Despite serious struggles with cocaine addiction, related legal issues, and periods of imprisonment that hindered his momentum, Isaacs remained astonishingly productive, recording for a wide range of Jamaican producers and continuing to release music on African Museum throughout the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s, culminating in collaborative projects such as *Isaacs Meets Isaac* (2010) with Zimbabwean singer King Isaac, which received a Grammy nomination.[1][2] Widely described as one of reggae’s most exquisite vocalists and a foundational figure in lovers rock, Isaacs left behind a vast catalog of more than 70 original studio albums and hundreds of compilations, and his influence continues to echo across reggae, dancehall, and contemporary R&B.[1][2]
