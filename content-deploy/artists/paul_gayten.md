## Biography
Paul Gayten (January 29, 1920 – March 26, 1991) was a pioneering American R&B pianist, bandleader, songwriter, producer, and record company executive, whose work was instrumental in shaping the sound of New Orleans rhythm and blues. Born in Kentwood, Louisiana, Gayten was immersed in music from an early age, being the nephew of renowned blues pianist Little Brother Montgomery. As a teenager, he played piano in local bands and formed his own group, Paul Gayten's Sizzling Six, which featured future jazz luminary Teddy Edwards. During World War II, he led a band at an Army base in Biloxi, Mississippi, before moving to New Orleans, where his trio became a fixture at Club Robin Hood.

Gayten's career took off in the late 1940s when he recorded two early New Orleans R&B hits, "True (You Don't Love Me)" and "Since I Fell for You" (the latter featuring vocalist Annie Laurie), both of which reached the R&B top ten. He expanded his group into a nine-piece orchestra, wrote the #1 R&B hit "For You My Love" for Larry Darnell, and toured widely, sharing bills with jazz greats like Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker. In the 1950s, Gayten transitioned from performing to producing and talent scouting, joining Chess Records where he discovered and produced Clarence "Frogman" Henry's hits, co-wrote "But I Do," and contributed as a pianist to Chuck Berry's recordings. In the late 1960s, he founded his own label, Pzazz, and continued to influence the music industry until his retirement.

Gayten's musical style blended boogie-woogie, jump blues, and early R&B, laying groundwork for the emergence of rock and roll. His legacy endures through his recordings, his role in launching the careers of other artists, and his contributions to the evolution of American popular music.
