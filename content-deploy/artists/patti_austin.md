## Biography
Patti Austin, born August 10, 1950, in Harlem, New York, grew up immersed in music as the daughter of a trombonist and a singer, with godparents Dinah Washington and Quincy Jones. She debuted onstage at age four with Dinah Washington at Harlem's Apollo Theater, secured an RCA recording contract by age five, and appeared on television shows like Sammy Davis Jr.'s while performing in theater productions such as *Lost in the Stars* and *Finian's Rainbow*. At nine, she toured Europe with Quincy Jones, and by her teens, she recorded R&B singles for labels like Decca/Coral, RCA, and United Artists, charting with 'Family Tree' in 1969, and toured with Harry Belafonte at 16.[1][2][3][5][8]

Transitioning to session work, Austin became the 'Queen' of New York's jingle and backup scene in the 1970s, singing on hits like James Brown's 'It's a Man's Man's Man's World,' Paul Simon's '50 Ways to Leave Your Lover,' and recordings by Cat Stevens, Bette Midler, Diana Ross, Roberta Flack, Joe Cocker, and Luther Vandross. Signed to CTI Records, she released albums like *End of a Rainbow* (1976) with elite jazz musicians including Randy and Michael Brecker, Eric Gale, Chuck Rainey, and Steve Gadd. Her breakthrough came in the 1980s via Quincy Jones' projects, including the duet 'Baby, Come to Me' with James Ingram from her 1981 album *Every Home Should Have One*, which topped charts in 1983, alongside collaborations with Michael Jackson on 'It's the Falling in Love' and George Benson on 'Moody's Mood for Love.'[1][3][4][5]

Austin's versatile style spans R&B, pop, jazz, and yacht rock, earning Grammy wins for albums like *For Ella* and *Avant Gershwin*, plus seven nominations overall and an honorary doctorate from Berklee College of Music. She has released over 19 solo albums, continues touring with projects like *Bebop to Hip Hop* alongside Trevor Lawrence Jr., and maintains a legacy as a session legend and live performer, prioritizing artistry over stardom.[1][2][3]
