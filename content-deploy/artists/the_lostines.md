## Biography
The Lostines are a New Orleans-based duo formed by singer-songwriters Casey Jane Reece-Kaigler and Camille Wind Weatherford. Both artists grew up in musical families in the Pacific Northwest, specifically Oregon, before relocating to New Orleans as young adults. Their friendship and musical partnership began in the vibrant New Orleans DIY scene, where they initially crossed paths more than a decade ago. The two first collaborated when Camille sang backup vocals in one of Casey Jane’s earlier bands, eventually forming an a cappella doo-wop group called the Carondelettes with local musicians. Their early years were marked by street performances in the French Quarter and intimate campfire sessions with fellow songwriters, experiences that deeply shaped their musical identity and sense of community.[1][3][6]

Since officially joining forces as The Lostines in 2013, Casey Jane and Camille have developed a sound that blends classic country, vintage doo-wop, and mid-century girl group harmonies with a contemporary indie folk sensibility. Their music is characterized by ethereal harmonies, lilting guitars, and a playful yet sincere lyricism that explores themes of love, heartbreak, and hope. Their debut EP was released in 2018, followed by the acclaimed full-length album 'Meet the Lostines' in 2024, which features a host of collaborators from the New Orleans music scene. The Lostines' work is both a tribute to the musical traditions of their adopted home and a fresh, forward-looking take on Americana and retro pop.[1][2][3][4]

The Lostines have become an integral part of the New Orleans music community, contributing to projects by other artists and drawing inspiration from the region’s rich cultural tapestry. Their music, shaped by the warmth of friendship and the resilience of shared experience, has resonated with listeners seeking comfort and connection, especially during challenging times such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Their legacy is one of bridging musical eras and geographies, creating songs that feel both timeless and distinctly rooted in their personal journey.[1][3][6]
