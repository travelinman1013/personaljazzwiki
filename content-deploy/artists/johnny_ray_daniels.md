## Biography
Johnny Ray Daniels was born in 1946 in the Beaver Dam area of Greenville, North Carolina, one of seven children in a musical family. Growing up in eastern North Carolina, he learned to play guitar by watching his father and sang with his brothers in various musical groups. At age 20, Daniels co-founded the Soul Twisters, a five-man rock and roll combo that performed at colleges, clubs, and conventions throughout the region, often opening for national touring acts like Tony Orlando and Dawn and the Tams. The group recorded their only single around 1967 or 1968, a funky original composition called "Doing Our Dance" at Pitt Sound Studios in Greenville.

Daniels' trajectory changed dramatically during a performance in the late 1960s when he experienced a spiritual awakening, feeling called away from secular music. Despite lucrative offers—including a $1,500 weekly contract and a customized van from a promoter—Daniels committed himself to gospel music. He married Dorothy Vines, a member of the Vines Sisters gospel group, and became an integral part of their sound as guitarist, pianist, and vocalist. The Glorifying Vines Sisters of Farmville, North Carolina, became well-respected in the gospel quartet community, recording multiple albums and performing alongside legendary acts like the Mighty Clouds of Joy, the Nightingales, and the Blind Boys of Mississippi throughout the late 1980s and 1990s.

After decades of supporting his wife's group and working his own carpet and tile installation business, Daniels released his debut solo album *Whatever You Need* in 2022 at age 76, produced by Bruce Watson's Bible & Tire Recording Co. His vocal style melds gospel, Delta blues, and Southern soul, featuring a rich, stirring baritone that testifies about God's power and faithfulness. Daniels is recognized as a pioneering figure in sacred soul music of eastern North Carolina, known for his original guitar playing style and passionate, sweaty performances that resonate with fans of vintage-style soul music.

## Fun Facts
- The mayor of White Plains, New York, was so impressed by Daniels' guitar playing during a Soul Twisters performance that he offered Daniels free accommodations and a permanent position to relocate his family and make music in White Plains—an offer Daniels refused because he couldn't leave his band.
- Daniels experienced a spiritual vision during a nightclub performance where he saw a face telling him "You are in the wrong place," which prompted his complete departure from secular music and commitment to gospel.
- Despite turning down a lucrative $1,500 per week contract with a customized van offer from a promoter, Daniels remained faithful to his spiritual calling and dedicated himself to gospel music.
- Daniels funded the Glorifying Vines Sisters' first record out of his own pocket using income from his carpet and tile installation business, which he ran while maintaining his music career.
