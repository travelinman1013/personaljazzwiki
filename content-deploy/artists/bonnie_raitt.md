## Biography
Bonnie Lynn Raitt, born November 8, 1949, in Burbank, California, is an American singer, songwriter, and guitarist renowned for her soulful blend of blues, rock, folk, and country. Raised in a musical family—her father was Broadway star John Raitt—she was exposed early to both the performing arts and the roots music that would shape her career. Raitt attended Radcliffe College at Harvard, where she became deeply involved in the local folk and blues scene, forging connections with legendary blues musicians such as Son House and Mississippi Fred McDowell[1][6].

Raitt's self-titled debut album was released in 1971, earning critical acclaim for her expressive vocals and distinctive bottleneck slide guitar technique—a rarity among female artists at the time[1][5]. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, she built a reputation as a skilled interpreter and collaborator, working with artists like Warren Zevon, Little Feat, John Prine, and Leon Russell[1]. Despite modest commercial success during these years, her artistry was widely respected. Raitt's breakthrough came in 1989 with the album 'Nick of Time,' produced by Don Was, which won three Grammy Awards including Album of the Year and marked her ascent to mainstream stardom[1][5][6]. Subsequent albums such as 'Luck of the Draw' and 'Longing in Their Hearts' solidified her legacy, generating hits like 'Something to Talk About' and 'I Can't Make You Love Me.'

Raitt's musical style is rooted in blues, but she skillfully incorporates elements of folk, rock, and Americana, making her a versatile and influential figure in American music. Her emotive phrasing and masterful slide guitar have earned her numerous accolades, including 13 Grammy Awards, a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction, and recognition as one of Rolling Stone's greatest singers and guitarists[1]. Beyond her musical achievements, Raitt is known for her activism and mentorship, inspiring generations of musicians with her artistry and commitment to social causes.
