## Biography
Cold Blood is a San Francisco East Bay-based soul-rock-jazz band founded in 1968 by guitarist Larry Field, evolving from earlier groups like The Generation and the New Invaders. Lead singer Lydia Pense, who joined that year from a Peninsula band with bassist Rod Ellicott, defined the group's sound with her powerful vocals. Discovered at the Fillmore Auditorium, the band impressed promoter Bill Graham, who signed them to his San Francisco Records label; Janis Joplin also recommended them. They debuted amid the peak of the Fillmore era, pioneering 'East Bay Grease'—a brass-heavy funk-rock style alongside Tower of Power—with high-energy performances and albums like *Cold Blood* (1969), *Sisyphus*, *First Taste of Sin*, and *Thriller*.[1][2][3][5][6]

The band's 1970s career featured top Bay Area musicians, including keyboardist/arranger Raul Matute, drummers Sandy McKee and Gaylord Birch, bassist Rod Ellicott, lead guitarists Larry Fields (early) and Michael Sasaki, and a world-class horn section with Jerry Jonutz, Danny Hull, David Padrón, Larry Jonutz, plus contributions from ex-Tower of Power members Mic Gillette and Skip Mesquite. Despite frequent personnel changes, questionable management, weak distribution, and comparisons to Janis Joplin (who praised their cover of 'Piece of My Heart'), they built a strong local following through Fillmore shows, festivals, and tours under Bill Graham's management with acts like Santana. Their sixth album, *Lydia Pense and Cold Blood* (1976), marked the end of their initial studio output; the band disbanded in the late 1970s as Pense raised her daughter Danielle.[1][2][3][4][7]

Pense retreated to Sonora and Humboldt County in the 1980s but revived Cold Blood by 1988 with new lineups, continuing to perform Bay Area club circuits and release albums like the California Music Award-winning *That’s My Partner* (2001), *Transfusion*, and *Live Blood*. Despite being overshadowed nationally by bands like Chicago, Blood Sweat & Tears, and Tower of Power, Cold Blood's timeless East Bay funk-soul endures, with Pense still active as a vocal powerhouse.[1][2][3][4]

## Fun Facts
- Gear worth $80,000 was stolen uninsured just weeks before Woodstock in 1969; Bill Graham sent Grateful Dead and Santana instead as 'punishment,' covering the loss himself.[1]
- Rehearsed with Tower of Power pre-breakout; band members hung out but were shocked by TOP's success.[1]
- Played a gig with Sly and the Family Stone where Sly never showed up, at Hayward club Frenchies.[1]
- Janis Joplin praised their blistering cover of 'Piece of My Heart' despite critics comparing Lydia Pense unfavorably to her.[2]
