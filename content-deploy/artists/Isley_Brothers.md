## Biography
The Isley Brothers are an American soul and R&B group formed in the mid‑1950s in Cincinnati, Ohio, by brothers O’Kelly Isley Jr., Rudolph Isley, Ronald Isley, and their younger brother Vernon as a teenage gospel quartet.[1][4][5] After Vernon was killed in a bicycle accident at age 13, the surviving trio stopped performing gospel but, encouraged by their parents, regrouped as a secular vocal group and moved to New York City in 1957 to pursue a rock ’n’ roll career.[1][4] They first recorded for labels such as Teenage and RCA Victor, breaking through in 1959 with the call‑and‑response anthem **“Shout”**, which became a million‑seller, and later scored another major early hit with **“Twist and Shout”** in 1962.[1][5] In the mid‑1960s they briefly ran their own T‑Neck label and worked with a young **Jimi Hendrix** as their guitarist, then signed to Motown in 1965, where they enjoyed success with **“This Old Heart of Mine (Is Weak for You)”**.[1][4][5]

Dissatisfied with Motown’s constraints, the group reactivated T‑Neck in 1969 and forged a distinctive, funk‑driven sound, epitomized by the Grammy‑winning hit **“It’s Your Thing”**.[1][4][5] In the early 1970s, younger brothers **Ernie** (lead guitar, drums) and **Marvin** (bass) Isley and brother‑in‑law **Chris Jasper** (keyboards, synthesizers) joined, transforming the original vocal trio into a self‑contained band that blended gritty funk, rock guitar, lush slow jams, and gospel‑inflected vocals.[1][4][5] This lineup powered a classic run of 1970s albums, including **“3 + 3”**, **“The Heat Is On”** (which topped the Billboard 200), and **“Between the Sheets,”** yielding enduring songs such as **“That Lady (Part 1),” “Fight the Power (Part 1),”** and **“For the Love of You (Part 1 & 2).”**[1][5] Despite later lineup changes and the deaths of O’Kelly (1986), Marvin (2010), and Rudolph (2019), Ronald and Ernie Isley have continued to record and tour into the 21st century, releasing collaborations such as **“Power of Peace”** with Santana in 2017.[1][5]

Stylistically, the Isleys bridged multiple eras of Black popular music, evolving from gospel‑rooted doo‑wop and early rock ’n’ roll into Motown soul, psychedelic rock‑soul hybrids, hard funk, and smooth quiet‑storm balladry.[1][4][5][9] Their catalog has been widely sampled in hip‑hop and R&B, and they are noted for being one of the few acts to place hits on the Billboard Hot 100 across six consecutive decades, from the 1950s through the 2000s.[2] Their commercial success—millions of records sold, at least 16 Top 40 albums, and a long string of R&B chart staples—has been matched by institutional recognition: they were inducted into the **Rock & Roll Hall of Fame** in 1992 and received a **Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award** in 2014.[4][5] This multi‑generational continuity and genre‑spanning innovation have secured the Isley Brothers a central place in the histories of soul, funk, and rock.

## Musical Connections

### Mentors/Influences
- [[billy_ward_and_his_dominoes|Billy Ward and His Dominoes]] - Early vocal model; the young Isley Brothers patterned their initial group sound and stage approach after established gospel and R&B vocal outfits like Billy Ward and His Dominoes. (General influence on early Isley Brothers gospel and doo‑wop performances before their first records such as “Shout.”) [Mid‑1950s formative years in Cincinnati and early New York period.[1]]
- [[the_dixie_hummingbirds|The Dixie Hummingbirds]] - Influential gospel quartet whose harmonies and spiritual intensity informed the Isleys’ beginnings as a teenage gospel group. (Indirect influence on the Isleys’ early gospel repertory prior to their move into secular R&B.) [Early to mid‑1950s gospel period in Cincinnati.[1]]
- [[motown_records__berry_gordy_jr|Motown Records / Berry Gordy Jr.]] - While not a mentor in a formal sense, the group’s tenure at Motown under Berry Gordy exposed them to the label’s songwriting, production systems, and polished soul style, which shaped their later self‑produced work. (Albums and singles including “This Old Heart of Mine (Is Weak for You).”) [Motown period, roughly 1965–1968.[1][4][5]]

### Key Collaborators
- [[ernie_isley|Ernie Isley]] - Younger brother who became the band’s primary lead guitarist and a key songwriter and producer, helping drive the group’s shift into rock‑inflected funk and sophisticated R&B. (Major contributor to albums such as “3 + 3,” “The Heat Is On,” “Between the Sheets,” and many classic 1970s hits including “That Lady (Part 1)” and “Fight the Power (Part 1).”) [Joined recording lineup by late 1960s, core member from 1973 onward.[1][4][5]]
- [[marvin_isley|Marvin Isley]] - Younger brother and bassist whose playing anchored the group’s 1970s funk sound. (Key contributor on 1970s and early 1980s T‑Neck albums, including “3 + 3,” “The Heat Is On,” and “Between the Sheets.”) [Performed with group from early 1970s, formally part of main lineup from 1973 into the 1980s.[1][4][5]]
- [[chris_jasper|Chris Jasper]] - Brother‑in‑law (related through Rudolph’s marriage) who became the band’s keyboardist, arranger, and major songwriter, central to their 1970s sound. (Co‑writer/producer on much of the 1973–early 1980s catalog, including “For the Love of You,” “Between the Sheets,” and other T‑Neck releases.) [Joined core lineup in 1973; key member through early to mid‑1980s.[1][4][5]]
- [[jimi_hendrix|Jimi Hendrix]] - Served as the band’s lead guitarist early in his career, touring and recording with them and contributing to their live and studio sound. (Worked with the group around the time they operated the first iteration of T‑Neck Records; appeared on early‑ to mid‑1960s recordings and tours (pre‑Motown).) [Circa 1964–1965, before the group signed to Motown and before Hendrix’s solo breakthrough.[4][5][8]]
- [[elton_john_and_his_band|Elton John (and his band)]] - Elton John’s band backed the Isley Brothers during U.K. appearances, reflecting a cross‑Atlantic collaboration between soul and rock artists. (Live performances in the United Kingdom with Elton John’s band providing backing.) [Mid‑ to late‑1960s U.K. tour period.[4]]
- [[santana|Santana]] - Collaborative partner on a later‑career studio project that fused the Isleys’ R&B and soul roots with Santana’s Latin rock and guitar‑driven sound. (Album “Power of Peace.”) [Released in 2017.[5]]

### Artists Influenced
- [[hiphop_and_randb_artists_who_sample_the_isley_brothers_e.g._the_notorious_b.i.g._ice_cube_aaliyah_and_others|Hip‑hop and R&B artists who sample the Isley Brothers (e.g., The Notorious B.I.G., Ice Cube, Aaliyah, and others)]] - The Isleys’ 1970s and 1980s recordings, especially their funk grooves and slow jams, have been heavily sampled, shaping the sonic palette of later hip‑hop and contemporary R&B. Their work is frequently cited by critics and historians as foundational source material for multiple generations of producers and vocalists. (Heavily sampled tracks include “Between the Sheets,” “Footsteps in the Dark,” and “For the Love of You,” which appear, in altered form, on numerous hip‑hop and R&B recordings (documentation of extensive sampling is widely noted in discographic and critical sources).) [From the late 1980s sampling era onward, continuing into the 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s.[9]]
- [[later_soul_funk_and_quietstorm_vocal_groups_and_solo_singers|Later soul, funk, and quiet‑storm vocal groups and solo singers]] - Music historians credit the Isley Brothers with pioneering the fusion of rock guitar and funk rhythms in R&B and helping to define the lush, romantic quiet‑storm ballad style, which influenced countless later soul acts. (Influence radiates from albums such as “3 + 3,” “The Heat Is On,” and “Between the Sheets,” and ballads like “For the Love of You,” which became templates for smooth, slow‑jam R&B.) [Mid‑1970s onward, as subsequent R&B artists drew on the group’s arrangements and vocal approaches.[5][9]]
- [[rock_and_crossover_randb_artists_inspired_by_their_hybrid_funkrock_sound|Rock and crossover R&B artists inspired by their hybrid funk‑rock sound]] - By bringing distorted lead guitar and rock dynamics into soul and funk, particularly through Ernie Isley’s playing, the band anticipated later funk‑rock fusions adopted by artists across R&B and rock. (Songs like “That Lady (Part 1)” and “Fight the Power (Part 1)” are frequently cited in critical writing as archetypal funk‑rock hybrids that inspired later experimentation in these genres.) [From the 1970s forward, as rock and R&B artists absorbed their stylistic innovations.[5][6][9]]
