## Biography
Tav Falco, born Gustavo Antonio Falco in 1945 in rural Arkansas, is an American musician, performance artist, filmmaker, and photographer whose career has spanned over four decades. After spending his formative years between Gurdon and Whelen Springs, Arkansas, Falco moved to Memphis in the late 1960s, where he immersed himself in the local arts scene. Initially a documentary filmmaker and photographer, Falco trained under renowned photographer William Eggleston and co-founded the art-action group TeleVista. His early work involved documenting the performances of blues and rockabilly legends such as R.L. Burnside and Charlie Feathers, which sparked his own interest in music.[1][6][7]

Falco's musical debut was as much performance art as it was music: in 1978, he famously destroyed a guitar with a chainsaw on stage at the Orpheum Theatre in Memphis, catching the attention of Alex Chilton of Big Star. Encouraged by Chilton, Falco formed Tav Falco's Panther Burns in 1979, blending proto-punk, roots rock, rockabilly, blues, and avant-garde influences into a style often described as 'art damage.' The band became a fixture of the Memphis underground, sharing stages with The Cramps and The Gun Club, and released their acclaimed debut album 'Behind the Magnolia Curtain' in 1981. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Falco expanded his artistic reach, touring internationally, acting in films, and incorporating tango and cabaret into his music after relocating to Europe, first Paris and then Vienna.[1][2][3][4][5]

Falco is recognized for his commitment to reviving and celebrating obscure American musical traditions, often collaborating with or spotlighting overlooked artists. His work, both musical and cinematic, is characterized by a romantic, subversive sensibility and a deep reverence for the cultural history of the American South. With a discography spanning over a dozen albums and a legacy as a postmodern provocateur, Falco continues to influence underground and alternative music scenes worldwide.[2][3][4][6]
