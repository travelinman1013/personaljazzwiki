## Biography
Don Sebesky (December 10, 1937 – April 29, 2023) was an American composer, arranger, conductor, and jazz trombonist whose work helped define the sound of modern large‑ensemble jazz and crossover orchestral pop from the 1960s onward.[2][4] Raised in New Jersey, he began on accordion at age eight—an instrument he later credited with giving him a deep grounding in harmony and counterpoint—before taking up trombone and formal studies in composition and arranging.[7] He attended the Manhattan School of Music, and by his early twenties was playing trombone in prominent big bands, including those led by Kai Winding, Claude Thornhill, Tommy Dorsey (the post‑Dorsey ghost band), and Maynard Ferguson, experiences that immersed him in sophisticated big‑band writing and modern jazz idioms.[5]

Transitioning from sideman to in‑demand arranger in the 1960s, Sebesky became a central figure at Creed Taylor’s CTI Records, where his lush, rhythmically modern orchestrations shaped landmark albums for artists such as Wes Montgomery, George Benson, and Freddie Hubbard.[1][4] His own albums, notably "Giant Box" and "The Rape of El Morro," blended jazz improvisation with classical forms, pop tunes, and expanded orchestral colors, exemplifying a crossover style that was both accessible and harmonically advanced.[2][4] Over the course of a career that extended into film, television, and Broadway—where he won Tony and Drama Desk Awards for his orchestrations for "Kiss Me, Kate"—Sebesky received more than 30 Grammy nominations and three Grammy Awards, underscoring his status as one of the most respected composer‑arrangers of his era.[4][6] His arrangements, characterized by transparent voicings, bold reharmonizations, and a keen sense of drama, continue to influence jazz arrangers and orchestrators across genres.[1][3]

## Fun Facts
- Sebesky’s first instrument was the accordion, which he started at age eight; he later said it turned out to be the “best possible choice” for a future arranger because it demands simultaneous attention to melody, harmony, and bass.[7]
- Before becoming known as an arranger, he was an in‑demand jazz trombonist and alumnus of several major big bands, including those of Kai Winding, Claude Thornhill, Tommy Dorsey, and Maynard Ferguson.[5]
- He amassed more than 30 Grammy nominations and won three Grammy Awards, an unusually high tally for an arranger‑orchestrator rather than a front‑line soloist.[4][6]
- Beyond jazz and records, Sebesky became a prominent Broadway orchestrator, earning both Tony and Drama Desk Awards for his work on the 1999 revival of "Kiss Me, Kate."[4]

## Musical Connections

### Mentors/Influences
- [[kai_winding|Kai Winding]] - Bandleader and senior trombonist whose group gave Sebesky early big‑band and small‑group experience, shaping his sense of trombone writing and ensemble texture. (Performances and recordings as trombonist in Kai Winding’s band (early career big‑band work).) [Late 1950s–early 1960s[5]]
- [[claude_thornhill|Claude Thornhill]] - Leader of a harmonically adventurous big band whose orchestrational approach and use of color provided an important model for Sebesky’s later large‑ensemble writing. (Touring and recording with the Claude Thornhill band as trombonist.) [Circa late 1950s[5]]
- [[maynard_ferguson|Maynard Ferguson]] - High‑energy big‑band leader whose modern charts and brass writing influenced Sebesky’s approach to contemporary, rhythmically driven orchestration. (Performances with the Maynard Ferguson orchestra as a trombonist.) [Late 1950s–early 1960s[5]]

### Key Collaborators
- [[wes_montgomery|Wes Montgomery]] - Sebesky served as primary arranger for Montgomery’s late‑1960s CTI recordings, helping craft the guitarist’s orchestral crossover sound. (Arrangements for CTI albums including projects such as "Bumpin'" and "Tequila" (widely cited CTI collaborations).) [Mid‑1960s[1][4]]
- [[george_benson|George Benson]] - Key collaborator at CTI; Sebesky’s arrangements framed Benson’s guitar and vocals in rich, contemporary orchestral settings that broadened Benson’s appeal. (Arranging and orchestrating on CTI releases for George Benson.) [Late 1960s–1970s[1][4]]
- [[freddie_hubbard|Freddie Hubbard]] - Collaborated as arranger on Hubbard’s CTI recordings, contributing to some of the most influential jazz‑fusion and crossover albums of the period. (Arrangements on CTI albums such as "First Light," which earned critical acclaim and awards.) [Early 1970s[1][4]]
- [[creed_taylor|Creed Taylor]] - Producer and founder of CTI Records; Taylor regularly hired Sebesky as house arranger, making him central to the label’s signature sound. (Extensive arranging work across CTI catalog, including projects for Montgomery, Benson, Hubbard and others.) [1960s–1970s[1][4]]
- [[carlos_santana|Carlos Santana]] - Sebesky was engaged by Santana for orchestral arranging, recognized by Santana as one of his favorite arrangers. (Orchestrations/arrangements for Santana projects (noted by Manhattan School of Music profile).) [1990s–2000s[6]]

### Artists Influenced
- [[contemporary_jazz_arrangers_and_orchestrators|Contemporary jazz arrangers and orchestrators]] - Sebesky’s CTI work and large‑ensemble albums became reference points for later jazz and crossover arrangers seeking to blend jazz harmony with pop, classical, and cinematic elements. (Influence traceable to albums such as "Giant Box" and his orchestrations for "Kiss Me, Kate," which are studied and emulated in arranging programs.) [1980s onward (ongoing influence)[1][3][4]]
