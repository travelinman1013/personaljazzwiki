## Biography
Ralph Towner, born March 1, 1940, in Chehalis, Washington, grew up in a musical family—his mother was a piano teacher and his father a trumpet player. He began improvising on piano at age three and later studied classical piano and composition at the University of Oregon, followed by classical guitar studies with Karl Scheit at the Vienna Academy of Music. Towner’s early career was shaped by his classical training and a deep affinity for jazz, particularly influenced by pianist Bill Evans.

In the late 1960s, Towner moved to New York City, where he immersed himself in the jazz scene, performing as both a pianist and guitarist. He joined Paul Winter’s Consort, where he was introduced to the 12-string guitar, an instrument that would become central to his sound. In 1970, Towner and fellow Consort members Paul McCandless, Glen Moore, and Collin Walcott formed Oregon, a group renowned for its innovative blend of jazz, classical, folk, and world music elements. Towner’s long association with ECM Records began in the early 1970s, resulting in a prolific solo and collaborative discography that has helped define the label’s signature sound.

Towner’s music is characterized by its organic fusion of jazz improvisation, classical structure, and global influences, often performed on classical and 12-string guitars. Over a career spanning more than five decades, he has become a leading figure in contemporary jazz and acoustic music, celebrated for his compositional depth, technical mastery, and boundary-defying collaborations. His legacy is cemented not only through his solo work and the enduring influence of Oregon, but also through his impact on generations of guitarists and improvisers.
