## Biography
Smithfield Fair is a Louisiana-based acoustic folk group that has maintained one of the longest continuous careers in American singer-songwriter music, spanning over 50 years since their formation in 1973. The group originated in Pensacola, Florida under the name 'Laughter' as a project by Dudley-Brian Smith to promote original songs featuring harmony vocals and acoustic instrumentation. After moving to Alexandria, Louisiana in 1976, they evolved through several incarnations, first as 'Charmer' (1976-1989) and finally settling on 'Smithfield Fair' in 1989 when they shifted focus to Scottish traditional music, reflecting their shared Scottish heritage.

Throughout their career, Smithfield Fair has released 36 formal albums, with their music gaining international recognition and distribution through labels like Centaur World Records. The group's sound has been described by critics as 'a folksy Supertramp' with a 'definite Peter Gabriel vibe,' seamlessly blending traditional Scottish folk with original compositions. Their 1982 song 'It's Never Too Late' experienced a recent resurgence, garnering re-releases by Los Angeles' Forager Records and London-based BBE, leading to extensive international radio airplay from Denmark to Japan. The current lineup consists of Jan Smith (vocals, piano, guitar), Bob Smith (vocals, acoustic bass, percussion), and Dudley-Brian Smith (vocals, acoustic guitars, mandolin), who continue to perform and release new music while maintaining their reputation as one of North America's foremost presenters of Scottish music.

## Fun Facts
