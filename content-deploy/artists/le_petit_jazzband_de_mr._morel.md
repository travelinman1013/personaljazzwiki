## Biography
Le Petit Jazzband de Mr. Morel is a French traditional jazz ensemble dedicated to the authentic recreation of early jazz and Dixieland styles. The group was originally formed under the leadership of Jean-Pierre Morel, a clarinetist and bandleader known for his passion for classic New Orleans jazz. Over the years, the band became recognized for its energetic performances and meticulous attention to period detail, both in repertoire and instrumentation.

In 2003, Gérard Gervois took over as leader, and the band was renamed simply Le Petit Jazzband, with Jean-Pierre Morel continuing to play a central role. The ensemble has performed widely across Europe, including notable appearances in the Netherlands, and has released several albums, such as 'Delta Bound' (1999) and 'Cafe Capers.' Their music is characterized by lively rhythms, collective improvisation, and a deep respect for the roots of jazz, drawing on the works of early jazz composers like Jelly Roll Morton and Sidney Bechet. Le Petit Jazzband de Mr. Morel is celebrated among traditional jazz circles for preserving and revitalizing the spirit of early 20th-century jazz.
