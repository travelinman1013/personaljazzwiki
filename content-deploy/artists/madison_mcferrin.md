## Biography
Madison McFerrin, born November 5, 1991, in San Francisco, California, is an American singer-songwriter renowned for her innovative blend of a cappella, soul, jazz, and electronic music. The daughter of legendary vocalist Bobby McFerrin and granddaughter of operatic baritone Robert McFerrin Sr., Madison grew up immersed in a rich musical environment, exposed to artists like Stevie Wonder, James Brown, Aretha Franklin, The Beatles, and Erykah Badu. She decided to pursue singing at the age of five and later attended Berklee College of Music in Boston, where she honed her songwriting skills and formed the funk band Cosmodrome.

After graduating, McFerrin moved to Brooklyn and began her independent career, initially gaining attention for her unique 'soulappella' style—layered, looped vocal harmonies performed live. Her debut EP, 'Finding Foundations: Vol. 1,' was released in 2016, followed by 'Finding Foundations: Vol. II' in 2018, both earning critical acclaim for their vocal dexterity and fresh approach to a cappella. Madison’s music has been featured in major venues and festivals, and she has received recognition from outlets like Pitchfork and NPR. Her debut album, 'I Hope You Can Forgive Me,' arrived in 2023, followed by 'SCORPIO' in 2025, solidifying her place in the new school of soul and alternative R&B. McFerrin is also known for her community engagement, curating performance series that uplift women of color and support social justice initiatives.
