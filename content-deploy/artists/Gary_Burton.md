## Biography
Gary Burton, born January 23, 1943, in Anderson, Indiana, is an American jazz vibraphonist, composer, and educator celebrated for revolutionizing the vibraphone’s role in jazz. Largely self-taught, Burton began playing the vibraphone as a child and quickly developed a unique four-mallet technique that allowed for a fuller, more pianistic sound, setting a new standard for the instrument. By age 17, he made his recording debut in Nashville with guitarists Hank Garland and Chet Atkins, and soon after, while attending Berklee College of Music, he joined the groups of George Shearing and Stan Getz, gaining early recognition for his prodigious talent.[1][2][3][5][6]

In the late 1960s, Burton formed his own quartet, pioneering the jazz fusion movement by blending jazz improvisation with rock rhythms and sonorities. Albums like 'Duster' and 'Lofty Fake Anagram' were groundbreaking, and his bands featured such future luminaries as Larry Coryell and Pat Metheny. Burton’s long and fruitful collaboration with pianist Chick Corea, beginning in 1972, helped popularize the jazz duet format and earned them multiple Grammy Awards. As an educator, Burton spent decades at Berklee College of Music, influencing generations of musicians and furthering jazz education.[1][2][3][4][5]

Burton’s legacy is defined by his technical innovation, genre-crossing collaborations, and commitment to teaching. He has received numerous accolades, including seven Grammy Awards and DownBeat’s Jazzman of the Year. Openly gay since 1994, Burton is also recognized for his advocacy and visibility within the jazz community. He retired from performing in 2017, leaving behind a profound impact on both jazz performance and pedagogy.[1][2][3][4][5]
