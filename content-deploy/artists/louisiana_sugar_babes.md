## Biography
The Louisiana Sugar Babes were a short-lived but historically significant jazz ensemble active in the late 1920s. The group was formed in New York City and brought together some of the most influential musicians of the Harlem stride and early jazz scenes, including Fats Waller (piano and organ), James P. Johnson (piano), and the legendary clarinetist and soprano saxophonist, Garvin Bushell. Their brief collaboration resulted in a handful of recordings on March 27, 1928, which are now considered classics of the era[4].

The Sugar Babes' music was rooted in the stride piano tradition, blending ragtime rhythms with the improvisational spirit of early jazz. Their recordings, such as 'Persian Rug,' 'Sippi,' 'Thou Swell,' and 'Willow Tree,' showcase intricate interplay between piano and reeds, highlighting both technical mastery and a playful, swinging sensibility. Although the group was not a long-term project, its members were already established as leading figures in jazz, and their collaboration is seen as a high point of the Harlem Renaissance's musical creativity.

Despite their brief existence, the Louisiana Sugar Babes left a lasting legacy through their innovative approach to ensemble jazz and their influence on later generations of musicians. The group's recordings are prized by collectors and historians, offering a rare glimpse into the collaborative spirit and virtuosity that defined New York jazz in the late 1920s[4].
