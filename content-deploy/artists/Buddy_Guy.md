## Biography
Buddy Guy, born George Guy on July 30, 1936, in Lettsworth, Louisiana, is a towering figure in the history of blues music. Growing up in a sharecropper’s family, he built his first makeshift guitar at age seven and taught himself to play by emulating blues artists he heard on the radio, such as John Lee Hooker. As a teenager, Guy began performing in Baton Rouge clubs, where his intense guitar style and passionate vocals quickly set him apart. After moving to Chicago in 1957, he was discovered by Muddy Waters, who helped him find work and introduced him to the city’s vibrant blues scene. Guy soon became a sought-after session musician at Chess Records, playing alongside legends like Howlin’ Wolf and Little Walter, and began recording his own material, including hits like 'Leave My Girl Alone' and 'Stone Crazy.'[1][2][4][5]

Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Guy’s innovative electric guitar work and flamboyant stage presence helped define the Chicago blues sound, bridging traditional blues with a modern, sometimes avant-garde style. He frequently collaborated with harmonica player Junior Wells and influenced a generation of rock guitarists, including Eric Clapton, Jimi Hendrix, and Stevie Ray Vaughan. Despite a dip in popularity during the rise of rock music, Guy’s career experienced a resurgence in the 1990s, earning him multiple Grammy Awards and international acclaim. He has released over 20 studio and live albums and remains an active performer and recording artist well into his 80s. Guy’s legacy is cemented by his induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the Blues Hall of Fame, and numerous honors, including the National Medal of Arts and Kennedy Center Honors.[1][2][3]
