## Biography
Preservation Hall is an iconic music venue and collective located in the heart of New Orleans' French Quarter, founded in 1961 by Allan and Sandra Jaffe. Its origins trace back to the 1950s, when Larry Borenstein, proprietor of an art gallery at 726 St. Peter Street, began hosting informal jazz sessions featuring legendary local musicians such as George Lewis, Sweet Emma Barrett, Billie and De De Pierce, and the Humphrey Brothers[1][2][3]. The Jaffes, inspired by the purity and tradition of the music, moved to New Orleans and took over the nightly operations, transforming the gallery into Preservation Hall—a rare integrated space during the Jim Crow era, dedicated to preserving the city's unique jazz heritage[1][3].

Preservation Hall quickly became the epicenter for traditional New Orleans jazz, hosting nightly concerts with master practitioners and drawing national attention. In 1963, the Jaffes established the Preservation Hall Jazz Band, which began touring internationally to promote and sustain the legacy of New Orleans jazz[2][4]. Many founding members of the band had direct ties to early jazz pioneers, including Buddy Bolden, Jelly Roll Morton, and Louis Armstrong. Over the decades, the Hall and its band have remained committed to nurturing and perpetuating the art form, operating under the leadership of the Jaffes' son, Ben Jaffe, since Allan's passing in 1987[1][2][4].

Musically, Preservation Hall is renowned for its dedication to acoustic, traditional jazz, drawing from a rich blend of African, Caribbean, and European influences that shaped New Orleans music at the turn of the 20th century. The Hall has served as a living museum and a vibrant performance space, supporting generations of musicians and fostering collaborations across genres. Its legacy is both local and global, as it continues to inspire new audiences and artists while remaining a steadfast guardian of jazz tradition[1][2][4].
