## Biography
Tyrone Davis, born Tyrone D. Fettson (or Branch) on May 4, 1938, near Greenville, Mississippi, emerged from humble beginnings as the son of sharecroppers. He moved north with his family, first to Saginaw, Michigan, and then settled in Chicago in 1959. In Chicago, Davis worked as a valet and chauffeur for blues legend Freddie King by day, while performing in South Side clubs at night. His talent was recognized by pianist Harold Burrage, who helped him record his first single in 1965 under the stage name 'Tyrone the Wonder Boy.'[3][4][6]

Davis's career took off in 1968 when he signed with Dakar Records and released 'Can I Change My Mind,' which became a number one hit on the R&B charts and reached number three on the pop charts. This success marked a shift from his blues-influenced beginnings to a smoother, romantic soul style that defined his signature sound. Throughout the 1970s, Davis continued to dominate the charts with hits like 'Turn Back the Hands of Time' and 'Turning Point,' ultimately placing 43 singles on the R&B charts between 1968 and 1988. He later explored disco with tracks such as 'Give It Up (Turn It Loose)' and signed with Columbia Records in 1977.[1][3][4][6]

Davis's music, characterized by heartfelt vocals and themes of love and reconciliation, resonated deeply with audiences and influenced the soul and blues scenes, especially in Chicago. His enduring popularity earned him a loyal following and recognition, including the R&B Foundation Pioneer Award in 1998. Davis remained active on the 'chitlin circuit' for decades, performing until his death from stroke complications in 2005. His legacy endures as one of America's most beloved soul singers.[4][5][6]
