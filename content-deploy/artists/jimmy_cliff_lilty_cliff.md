## Biography
Jimmy Cliff, born James Chambers on July 30, 1944, in Somerton, Jamaica, emerged as one of reggae music's pioneering international ambassadors. Raised by a deeply religious tailor and farmer father after his parents separated, Cliff discovered his musical calling through American R&B artists like Sam Cooke, Ray Charles, and Fats Domino. As a teenager, he began his recording career after meeting Leslie Kong at Beverly Records in Kingston around 1962, achieving his breakthrough hit "Hurricane Hattie" at just 14 years old—a song inspired by an actual Caribbean hurricane. This early success established him as a Jamaican music star and led to his selection as part of a Jamaican delegation to the 1964 World's Fair in New York, where his performance caught the attention of British-Jamaican music executive Chris Blackwell of Island Records.

After relocating to London in 1965, Cliff broadened his musical palette by incorporating soul, rhythm and blues, and reggae influences into his work. His 1970 album "Wonderful World, Beautiful People" became an international hit and notably inspired Paul Simon to explore reggae music. However, Cliff's defining moment came with his starring role in the landmark 1972 film "The Harder They Come," where he contributed iconic soundtrack classics including "Many Rivers to Cross," "Sitting in Limbo," and the title track. This film catapulted reggae onto the global stage and established Cliff as the genre's first major international star. By the late 1960s, he had already achieved significant popularity in South America, winning a festival prize in Brazil for his song "Waterfall."

Though his mainstream success in Jamaica, Britain, and the United States was eventually overshadowed by Bob Marley's rise, Cliff maintained tremendous popularity across Africa and South America throughout his career. His 1993 cover of Johnny Nash's "I Can See Clearly Now" revitalized his broader international appeal, while his Grammy Award-winning albums "Cliff Hanger" (1985) and "Rebirth" (2012)—produced by punk legend Tim Armstrong—demonstrated his enduring relevance and willingness to collaborate across genres. Inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2010, Cliff's legacy as reggae's first king and a transformative figure in world music history remains undiminished nearly seven decades into his career.
