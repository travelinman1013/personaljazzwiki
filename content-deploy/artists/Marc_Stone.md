## Biography
Marc Stone is a New York City-born guitarist, singer, songwriter, radio DJ, and music journalist who has become a prominent figure in the New Orleans music scene. Born in 1970, Stone began performing in blues clubs at age seventeen, sharing stages early on with New York blues luminaries such as Johnny Allen, Jerry Dugger, Bill Sims, and members of the Holmes Brothers. In the early 1990s, he hosted the Eclectic Acoustic Jam in Greenwich Village, which attracted emerging talents like Dave Matthews and Alana Davis. 

In 1993, Stone relocated to New Orleans, where he immersed himself in the city’s vibrant musical culture and steadily built his reputation from street performances in the French Quarter to becoming one of the city’s most respected blues and roots artists. He has performed solo, with his own Marc Stone Band, and as a sought-after collaborator and sideman for numerous Louisiana legends, including C.J. Chenier, Eddie Bo, Marva Wright, Terrance Simien, Ernie K-Doe, and Allen Toussaint. Stone’s style is a dynamic blend of blues, soul, rock, Americana, and New Orleans funk, often featuring lap steel and slide guitar, and is known for both his original songwriting and his ability to channel the city’s musical traditions. 

Beyond performing, Stone is a producer and musical director, notably for the Louisiana Blues Throwdown series and benefit concerts such as 'A Change is Gonna Come.' He is also the host of the 'Soul Serenade' program on WWOZ 90.7 FM, where he showcases classic American roots music and interviews with legendary and emerging artists. Stone’s discography includes six albums, with recent works like 'Shining Like a Diamond' and 'Live at Tipitina’s' earning critical acclaim and award nominations. His legacy is marked by his role in revitalizing and preserving New Orleans roots music, as well as his global touring and collaborations.
