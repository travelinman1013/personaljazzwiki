## Biography
Leo 'Bud' Welch was born on March 22, 1932, in Sabougla, Mississippi, a rural community in Calhoun County. Growing up in a large family, Welch developed an early passion for music, first picking up a guitar around the age of 12. He learned to play on his cousin's instrument, and by his mid-teens, he was performing publicly, earning the respect of local musicians. Despite his musical talent, Welch spent most of his life working as a logger and cotton picker, playing music at church services and local gatherings in his spare time.

Welch's musical style was deeply rooted in the traditions of Mississippi blues and gospel. He played both genres throughout his life, often blurring the lines between sacred and secular music. His earliest influences included songs he heard on the radio and in films, such as 'Will the Circle Be Unbroken' and 'Navajo Trail.' Welch played in church groups like the Sabougla Voices and the Skuna Valley Male Chorus, and occasionally performed at local juke joints. Despite an offer to audition for B.B. King, Welch was unable to travel to Memphis due to financial constraints and remained largely unknown outside his community for decades.

Remarkably, Welch's recording career did not begin until he was 81 years old, when he was discovered by his friend and manager, Vencie Varnado. His debut album, 'Sabougla Voices,' was released in 2014, followed by additional recordings and international tours. Welch's late-in-life emergence brought him acclaim as a living link to the raw, unvarnished blues and gospel traditions of the American South. He continued to perform and record until his death in December 2017, leaving a legacy as a testament to perseverance and the enduring power of roots music.
