## Biography
Rosie Ledet and the Zydeco Playboys are a prominent zydeco band led by accordionist, singer, and songwriter Mary Roszela Bellard, known professionally as Rosie Ledet. Born in Church Point, Louisiana in 1971, Ledet grew up surrounded by zydeco music but initially gravitated toward rock & roll. Her passion for zydeco was ignited at age 16 after attending a dance at Richard's Club, where she was inspired by the legendary Boozoo Chavis. This pivotal moment led her to learn the accordion by watching her husband, Morris Ledet, play. Morris soon became her accompanist and introduced her to veteran zydeco producer Mike Lachney, who facilitated her first recording sessions.

Rosie Ledet formed her own band, the Zydeco Playboys, and began performing throughout Louisiana and Texas in 1994. That same year, she released her debut album 'Sweet Brown Sugar' on the Maison de Soul label. Known for her sultry and suggestive lyrics, Ledet quickly established herself as a rare female voice in the male-dominated zydeco scene, earning the nickname 'The Zydeco Sweetheart.' Over the years, Rosie Ledet and the Zydeco Playboys have become fixtures in the zydeco circuit, celebrated for their energetic performances and authentic Creole sound. Ledet's contributions have helped expand the presence of women in zydeco and brought new attention to the genre's rich cultural roots.
