## Biography
Helen Sung is an acclaimed American jazz pianist and composer, born and raised in Houston, Texas, to Chinese immigrant parents[1][2][5]. She began classical piano and violin lessons at age five, studying rigorously through her formative years and attending Houston’s prestigious High School for the Performing and Visual Arts[2][4][9]. Initially intent on a career as a classical concert pianist, Sung pursued undergraduate and master’s degrees in classical piano performance at the University of Texas at Austin[1][3][4]. Her musical trajectory shifted dramatically during her final undergraduate year when a friend took her to a Harry Connick, Jr. concert; the experience of hearing jazz piano live was transformative, leading her to immerse herself in jazz studies alongside her classical training[3][4][8].

Sung’s dedication to jazz culminated in her acceptance to the inaugural class of the Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz Performance at the New England Conservatory, where she studied with and performed alongside jazz legends such as Herbie Hancock and Wayne Shorter[1][2][4]. Since then, she has established herself as a leading figure in contemporary jazz, known for her technical mastery, inventive compositions, and ability to bridge classical and jazz traditions[1][5]. Sung has released several albums as a leader, including PUSH (2003), Helenistique (2006), Sungbird (After Albeniz) (2007), and Anthem for a New Day (2014), the latter of which topped jazz radio charts and appeared on international best-of lists[4]. Beyond performing, Sung is an educator, holding faculty positions at Berklee College of Music and serving as a jazz coach at The Juilliard School[1][3]. She is also recognized for her advocacy and outreach, developing programs for underserved students and leading workshops worldwide[1][2].
