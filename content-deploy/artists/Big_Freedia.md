## Biography
Big Freedia, born Freddie Ross Jr. on January 28, 1978, in Uptown New Orleans, is a pioneering artist and international ambassador for bounce music, a high-energy rap subgenre rooted in New Orleans. Raised by her mother and stepfather, Freedia was immersed in music from a young age, singing in the local Baptist church choir and serving as captain of her high school cheerleading squad. Inspired by the early 1990s bounce scene, particularly the work of MC T. Tucker and DJ Irv, Freedia began performing as a backup dancer and singer for bounce pioneer Katey Red in the late 1990s, before releasing her own debut album, 'Queen Diva,' in 2003.

After Hurricane Katrina, Freedia's rapid return to performing in New Orleans and her dynamic live shows helped revitalize the local music scene and brought national attention to bounce music. Through collaborations with artists like Galactic, Rusty Lazer, and later pop superstars such as Beyoncé, Drake, and Lizzo, Freedia expanded bounce's reach well beyond its regional roots. Her energetic performances, signature catchphrases, and advocacy for LGBTQ+ rights have made her a cultural icon, while her reality TV show 'Big Freedia: Queen of Bounce' (later 'Big Freedia Bounces Back') introduced her story to a wider audience.

Big Freedia is credited with popularizing twerking to mainstream audiences and has been recognized for her role in shaping contemporary pop and hip-hop. Her influence is evident in major works like Beyoncé's 'Formation' and 'Break My Soul,' and she continues to innovate within the genre, releasing new music and collaborating with a diverse array of artists. Freedia remains a proud advocate for her city, her roots, and the ongoing evolution of bounce music.
