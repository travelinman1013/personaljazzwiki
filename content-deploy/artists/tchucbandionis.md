## Biography
There is extremely limited verifiable information available about **Tchucbandionis** (often stylized **TchucbandioniS**), but existing sources indicate that it is a Brazilian band active in the early 2000s independent scene rather than an individual artist.[1][3][4] The group appears associated with São Paulo’s alternative/indie circuit, releasing material through Brazilian independent distribution channels such as Tratore/Reco‑Head. A track titled “Capoeira Jaz,” credited to TchucbandioniS and included on the album *O Novo Transmissor*, was released in 2002, placing the band within the turn‑of‑the‑millennium wave of experimental Brazilian rock and fusion groups.[3] Some Brazilian press and blogs mention Tchucbandionis in the same breath as other underground or regional rock bands, which suggests they were part of a broader network of independent Brazilian acts of that era rather than a mainstream project.[1][4]

Musically, the title “Capoeira Jaz” and their association with eclectic Brazilian scenes imply a fusion of Brazilian rhythmic traditions (such as capoeira rhythms) with jazz‑inflected or experimental rock elements, consistent with other early‑2000s São Paulo underground bands.[3][4] However, no reliable detailed descriptions of their full stylistic range, complete discography, or later career trajectory are available in accessible sources, and they do not appear to have maintained a significant digital or international presence. As a result, any claims about their long‑term legacy, membership, or broader influence beyond these sparse references would be speculative and are not supported by credible documentation.[1][3][4]

Given the lack of interviews, official biographies, or label notes in public archives, Tchucbandionis should be understood as a little‑documented participant in Brazil’s independent music ecosystem of the early 2000s, with at least one verified release track and scattered mentions in Brazilian music writing, but without sufficient data to construct a full conventional biography.[1][3][4]
