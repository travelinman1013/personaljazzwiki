## Biography
Patti Drew (born December 29, 1944, in Charleston, South Carolina; died June 16, 2025) was an American pop and soul singer whose career flourished in the late 1960s. Raised in Nashville, Tennessee, and later Evanston, Illinois, Drew’s musical roots were planted in the church, singing alongside her sisters Lorraine and Erma. Their talent was discovered by Capitol Records executive Maurice Lathouwers, leading to the formation of The Drew-Vels. The group’s 1964 single 'Tell Him,' featuring Carlton Black on bass, became a local pop and R&B hit, charting nationally and establishing Drew’s presence in the Chicago soul scene.

After The Drew-Vels disbanded in 1965, Patti Drew embarked on a solo career, first with Quill Records and then Capitol Records. Her re-recording of 'Tell Him' in 1967 became her signature hit, reaching #22 on the R&B charts. Drew released four albums, including 'Workin' On a Groovy Thing' (1968), and several singles that charted on both the pop and R&B charts. Her style blended smooth pop sensibilities with soulful vocals, earning her a loyal following and critical acclaim for her expressive delivery.

Though she stepped back from the national spotlight in the early 1970s, Drew continued to perform locally and made a brief return to recording in the 1970s and 1980s. Her influence endured, especially within the Chicano oldies and soul collector communities. In 2025, she was posthumously selected for induction into the National Rhythm and Blues Hall of Fame, cementing her legacy as a pioneering voice in American soul music.
