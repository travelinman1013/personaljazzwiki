## Biography
Mississippi Fred McDowell was born on January 12, 1904, in Rossville, Tennessee, into a family of farmers[1][4]. Orphaned at a young age, McDowell began playing guitar by age 14, fashioning a slide from a steer bone and performing for tips at local dances[1][4]. In his early twenties, he moved to Memphis, working at a feed mill and playing music on the streets, before settling in Como, Mississippi, around 1940, where he farmed and played music at local gatherings for decades[1][4]. McDowell’s big break came in 1959 when folklorist Alan Lomax recorded him during a field trip, capturing his raw, emotive North Mississippi hill country blues style—distinct from the Delta blues tradition[1][2][4]. These recordings, and later sessions with Arhoolie Records, propelled him to international fame in the 1960s, leading to festival appearances (including Newport Folk Festival in 1964), European tours, and a late-career embrace of electric guitar[2][3]. Despite his late start as a professional musician, McDowell became a vital bridge between the original blues masters and the rock generation, remaining true to his roots until his death from cancer in 1972[1][3].

## Fun Facts
- McDowell made his first recordings at age 55, after decades of playing locally, and became a full-time professional musician only in his sixties[1][3].
- He initially scorned electric guitars but, after trying one on a European tour, never returned to acoustic—a move that surprised blues purists[3].
- McDowell’s song 'You Gotta Move' earned him his first significant royalty check after The Rolling Stones covered it, which he remarked was the most money he had ever seen[3].
- Despite his nickname, McDowell’s style was rooted in the North Mississippi hill country, not the Delta, making him a distinctive voice in the blues tradition[2].
