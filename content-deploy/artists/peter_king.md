## Biography
Peter King Adeyoyin Osubu (1939 – 29 August 2023) was a Nigerian alto saxophonist renowned for fusing Afrobeat, highlife, and jazz. Born in Enugu, southeastern Nigeria, he grew up in Lokoja, Lagos, and Port Harcourt. He began his career in 1957 at age 18 with the Roy Chicago band in Ibadan, playing maracas and conga drums before mastering double bass, drums, and alto saxophone in various Nigerian bands[1]. In 1961, he moved to London to study at Trinity College of Music and other institutions, forming the African Messengers with Bayo Martins and Mike Falana, which backed acts like The Four Tops, The Temptations, and Diana Ross, and scored a hit with 'Highlife Piccadilly'[1].

King's style drew from Sonny Rollins, Gene Ammons, and John Coltrane, blending Nigerian highlife and Afrobeat with modern jazz and funk akin to James Brown. Returning to Nigeria in 1969, his group Voice of Africa performed during the Nigerian Civil War; he later toured globally with Shango and backed Boney M in 1977. He recorded nine albums from 1975-1978, including acclaimed works like *Shango* and *A Soulful Peter King*, featuring his 'Miliki Sound' on classics. Back in Nigeria from 1979, he formed the P.K. Band, composed for TV and plays, and in 1982 founded the Peter King School of Music in Badagry, training nearly 2,000 students[1].

King's legacy endures through his innovative Afrojazz, global performances, and educational impact, though more recognized abroad than in Nigeria. He passed away at 84, leaving a discography spanning *Shango* (1974) to *Palm Wine Vendor* (2002)[1].
