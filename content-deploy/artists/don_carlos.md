## Biography
Don Carlos, born Euvin Spencer on June 29, 1952, in the Waterhouse district of Kingston, Jamaica, emerged from one of the city's most musically fertile yet deprived neighborhoods. Waterhouse is renowned as the birthplace of many reggae legends, and Carlos began his singing career in the mid-1960s, recording his first tracks at Federal Studios in Kingston. In 1973, he co-founded the influential roots reggae group Black Uhuru alongside Garth Dennis and Derrick 'Duckie' Simpson, singing lead on their acclaimed debut album 'Love Crisis' (later reissued as 'Black Sounds of Freedom').

After leaving Black Uhuru in the late 1970s, Carlos developed a distinctive solo style rooted in melodic, conscious roots reggae, often collaborating with co-writer and vocalist Gold. His 1981 album 'Suffering' became a major success, especially in Africa, and established him as a solo force. Throughout the 1980s, Carlos was a prominent figure in both roots and dancehall scenes, releasing numerous hits and albums such as 'Harvest Time,' 'Day to Day Living,' and 'Laser Beam.' He later reunited with Black Uhuru from 1989 to 1994, contributing to four Grammy-nominated albums before returning to his solo career, which continues to thrive internationally.

Carlos's musical style blends uplifting melodies, socially conscious lyrics, and the deep grooves of roots reggae, dub, and rocksteady. His legacy is marked by his influence on subsequent generations of reggae artists, his international touring presence, and his enduring role as a bridge between classic and contemporary reggae sounds.
