## Biography
Maceo Parker, born February 14, 1943, in Kinston, North Carolina, is a legendary American saxophonist whose career has profoundly shaped funk, soul jazz, and related genres. Raised in a musical family—his father played piano and drums, his mother sang in church, and his brothers Melvin and Kellis played drums and trombone respectively—Parker picked up the saxophone in his pre-teen years and quickly developed a passion for music[2][3].

Parker's professional breakthrough came in the early 1960s when he joined James Brown's band alongside his brother Melvin. He soon became a key soloist, contributing signature horn lines to Brown's hits such as "I Feel Good" and "Papa's Got a Brand New Bag"[2][3]. After leaving Brown's band in 1970 to form Maceo & All the King's Men, Parker returned to Brown in 1973 and continued to record and tour. In the mid-1970s, he joined George Clinton's Parliament-Funkadelic, further expanding his influence in the funk world. From the 1990s onward, Parker established himself as a solo artist, releasing acclaimed albums like "Roots Revisited" and "Life on Planet Groove," and touring internationally[2][3][8].

Parker's musical style is characterized by a blend of jazz improvisation and hard-edged funk rhythms, often described as "2% jazz and 98% funky stuff"[7]. His energetic performances, melodic phrasing, and percussive horn blasts have made him a sought-after collaborator and an inspiration to generations of musicians. Parker's legacy is cemented not only by his work with icons like James Brown, George Clinton, and Prince, but also by his enduring solo career and influence on contemporary funk and jazz artists[2][3][1].
