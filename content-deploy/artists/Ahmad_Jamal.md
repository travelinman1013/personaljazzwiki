## Biography
Ahmad Jamal, born Frederick Russell Jones on July 2, 1930, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, was a prodigious jazz pianist whose career spanned over six decades. He began playing piano at the age of three, encouraged by his uncle, and received formal training from Mary Cardwell Dawson and James Miller. By his early teens, Jamal was already performing professionally and was recognized by jazz luminaries such as Art Tatum. His early exposure to both European classical music and the works of jazz greats like Duke Ellington, Art Tatum, and Erroll Garner shaped his distinctive approach to jazz piano.

Jamal's career took off after joining the George Hudson Orchestra as a teenager, followed by his work with Joe Kennedy Jr.'s Four Strings. In 1951, he formed his own group, which evolved into the Ahmad Jamal Trio. His 1958 album 'At the Pershing: But Not for Me,' featuring bassist Israel Crosby and drummer Vernel Fournier, became a landmark recording, noted for its minimalist style and innovative use of space. Jamal's orchestral conception of the jazz trio, his subtle rhythmic interplay, and his ability to let the music 'breathe' influenced generations of musicians. Throughout his career, he experimented with various ensemble formats and incorporated strings and electric instruments, earning critical acclaim and numerous honors, including the NEA Jazz Master award and the French Order of Arts and Letters.

Jamal's legacy is profound; he is credited with shaping the sound of modern jazz piano and inspiring artists across genres. His influence is especially notable in the work of Miles Davis, who frequently cited Jamal's use of space and repertoire choices. Jamal's music continues to be celebrated for its elegance, innovation, and enduring impact on jazz history.
