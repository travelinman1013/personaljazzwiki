## Biography
Tierra Helena Whack, born August 11, 1995, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, grew up in North Philadelphia with her mother and two younger siblings. A shy child, she found confidence through writing poetry and rhyming, inspired by Dr. Seuss, filling notebooks with lyrics after a positive homework experience where she rhymed her assignment. She attended The Arts Academy at Benjamin Rush for three years as a vocal major, performing rap with friends, and gained local fame around age 14 as 'Dizzle Dizz' in a viral We Run the Streets freestyle video encouraged by her mother. Influences included hip-hop artists like Jay-Z, DMX, Missy Elliott, Busta Rhymes, and Beanie Sigel. Her family moved to Atlanta in 2012 for her senior year of high school, where she worked at a car wash to buy recording equipment, honing her skills in isolation before returning to Philadelphia.[1][2]

Back in Philadelphia by 2015, Whack reconnected with producer Kenete Simms, who taught her production and mixing, and debuted as Tierra Whack in 2017 with tracks like 'Toe Jam' and 'Mumbo Jumbo,' the latter earning a Grammy nomination for Best Music Video. She signed with Interscope Records that year and released her breakthrough mixtape *Whack World* in May 2018, praised for its eclectic 15-song, 15-minute format blending rap, R&B, and whimsy. Known for her alternative R&B style with comedic, genre-experimental flair, she toured with Flying Lotus, released weekly singles during #whackhistorymonth in 2019, and dropped tracks like 'Dora' (2020) and EPs in 2021. Her playful visuals and unhurried approach prioritize creative fun over rushed albums.[1][2]

Whack's legacy includes co-signs from Erykah Badu, Solange, A$AP Rocky, and André 3000, Coachella performances, and features with Beyoncé, Alicia Keys, and Tyler, the Creator. Active since 2011, her honest, quirky persona and Philadelphia roots have established her as a innovative force in hip-hop and alternative music, with a popularity score of 54 on Spotify in alternative R&B.[1][2]
