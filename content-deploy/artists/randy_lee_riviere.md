## Biography
Randy Lee Riviere is an American singer‑songwriter, guitarist, and wildlife biologist whose blues‑rock and Americana songs are deeply rooted in the landscapes and communities of the American West. Originally from Northern California, he later settled in Bigfork, Montana, in Flathead County, where the open spaces and environmental struggles of the region became central to both his life and art.[2][3][4][8] Before recording under his own name, he released several albums in the early 2000s under the moniker **Mad Buffalo**, steadily sharpening his craft as a storyteller while working full‑time in wildlife biology and environmental preservation.[4][7][8] An “epiphany point” in Wyoming—where he confronted the contrast between pristine nature and rapid development—helped crystallize his dual path as conservationist and musician.[8]

Riviere’s catalog under his own name includes albums such as **Wyoming**, **Blues Sky**, **Farmhand Blues**, and **Concrete Blues**, often produced in Nashville while he continues to live and work in Montana.[1][2][6][7] His songs blend blues rock with Americana and roots influences, delivered in a distinctive, sonorous vocal style and set against electric guitars, keyboards, and rhythm sections that evoke the vastness and tensions of Western life.[1][2][5][7] Lyrically, he gravitates to themes of environmental degradation, rural communities under pressure, and the changing character of the American West—subjects informed by his career as a wildlife biologist and ecologist who devotes much of his time to habitat and species preservation.[2][3][5][6] Though working largely outside the commercial mainstream, he has developed a reputation in blues and roots circles as a “hidden gem” whose edgy, thoughtful blues‑rock offers a different vista on the genre.[1][5][7]

Riviere splits his time between Montana and Nashville, where he records with seasoned session players and producer‑drummer Tom Hambridge.[1][2][5][6] Across his work—from the early Mad Buffalo recordings to recent albums like **Farmhand Blues** and **Concrete Blues**—he continually returns to the imagery of ranches, small towns, rivers, and wide skies, using them as metaphors for personal reflection and social commentary.[1][2][6][7][8] His legacy to date lies in this uncommon fusion of field biologist and bluesman: an artist whose music documents contemporary Western landscapes not just from the outside, but from the perspective of someone actively fighting for their survival.[2][3][5][6][8]
