## Biography
Danielle Ponder is a R&B/soul artist from Rochester, New York who took an unconventional path to her music career.[1][3] The sixth of seven children, Ponder grew up in a musical household and was inspired to pursue law after her brother received a 20-year prison sentence under a "three strikes" law. She worked for five years as a public defender in the Monroe County Public Defender's office, where she represented indigent defendants and later served as a diversity, equity, and inclusion officer.[2][3] Throughout her legal career, she remained deeply committed to music, performing in bands and writing songs between classes and court cases, eventually touring in Europe while maintaining her law practice.[4]

At age 39, Ponder made the pivotal decision to leave her successful legal career to pursue music full time in 2018.[1][2] She spent three years writing and recording her debut album with keyboardist and collaborator Avis Reese and local producer Dave Drago.[4] In February 2021, manager Chris Douridas discovered her work and brought in co-manager Tom Windish, an agent who had worked with artists like Billie Eilish and Lorde, which led to her signing with Future Classic label.[4] Her debut album, "Some of Us Are Brave," released in October 2022, showcased her distinctive blend of pop, R&B, blues, rock, and trip-hop, topped by her powerful, celestial voice.[1][3][4]

Ponder's music draws from deep personal conviction and social consciousness, inspired by her brother's experience with the criminal justice system and her years advocating for vulnerable populations.[2][4] Her work has garnered critical acclaim, including major sync placements such as the Apple iPhone 16 Pro campaign, and she has performed at prestigious festivals including Bonnaroo, Lollapalooza, Afropunk, and Montreux Jazz Festival, as well as sold-out shows across North America and Europe.[1] Her single "So Long" exemplifies her artistic vision—a declaration of creative independence written during her recording process to remind herself to trust her instincts and artistic voice.[4]
