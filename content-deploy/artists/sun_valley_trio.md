## Biography
The Sun Valley Trio was a jazz trio based in Sun Valley, Idaho, renowned for entertaining the après-ski crowd at the Ram Bar for 30 years. Formed to provide lively jazz performances in the resort setting, the group captured the relaxed yet vibrant atmosphere of the ski community with their music[1]. One known member was Charles Macak, though full details on other personnel remain limited in available records.

The trio's career centered on consistent residency at the Ram Bar, where they became a staple of the Sun Valley social scene, blending jazz standards suitable for post-ski relaxation. Their style aligned with light jazz appealing to vacationers, though no recordings or specific influences are documented in primary sources[1]. The group disbanded in the mid-1960s, marking the end of their long tenure as the resort's musical fixture.

Though not widely recorded, the Sun Valley Trio's legacy endures as a symbol of mid-20th-century resort jazz culture in Idaho, contributing to the local entertainment tradition before fading with changing musical trends.
