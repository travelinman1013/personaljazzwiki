## Biography
Tess Henley is an acclaimed singer-songwriter and musician born and raised in Kent, Washington, near Seattle. She began Suzuki piano training at the age of three, and by five, she was already dissecting complex harmonies, inspired by her mother, a professional singer. Henley attended the University of Washington, where she continued to write and record original material, blending her early influences of Motown, soul, and R&B into her own unique style.[1][2]

Henley released her debut album, 'Easy To Love,' in 2008 at the age of twenty, followed by 'High Heels and Sneakers.' Her songwriting prowess quickly earned her recognition, winning multiple awards including Independent Music Awards and the grand prize in the 'Show Me The Music' songwriting competition. Her breakthrough came in 2014 when she became the first female winner of Guitar Center’s Singer/Songwriter Competition, selected by Grammy-winning producer Don Was from over 10,000 entrants. This led to the recording of her EP 'Wonderland' at Hollywood’s Henson Recording Studios, with Don Was describing her as 'a world class singer with a true gift.'[1][2]

Henley’s music is characterized by soulful vocals, warm arrangements, and a classic R&B sensibility that draws comparisons to artists from earlier eras. She has performed on national television, opened for artists like Jill Scott and Anthony Hamilton, and toured extensively in the US and Canada. Her artistry continues to evolve, earning her a reputation as a modern soul musician with deep roots in tradition and an eye toward the future.[2][1]
