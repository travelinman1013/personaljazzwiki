## Biography
The Electric Yat Quartet is a dynamic string quartet founded in 2020 and based in New Orleans, Louisiana. Comprised of classically trained musicians—Harry Hardin (violin), Natalia Cascante (violin), Amelia Clingman (viola), and Jack Craft (cello)—the group brings an eclectic approach to the traditional string quartet format. Their repertoire spans classical masterpieces, jazz standards, Argentine tangos, and contemporary pop hits, reflecting both their technical mastery and adventurous spirit. The ensemble's name, a playful nod to New Orleans vernacular, signals their intent to blend fun with serious musicianship, and to challenge expectations about what a string quartet can be.

Since their formation, the Electric Yat Quartet has become a fixture in the New Orleans music scene, performing at a wide range of venues from the French Quarter Festival to the Saenger Theatre, and collaborating with notable local artists. Their performances are characterized by versatility, often alternating between acoustic and electrified sets, and frequently featuring guest musicians such as pianist André Bohren. The group is committed to community engagement, regularly playing in schools and at public events, and has garnered a reputation for making classical music accessible and exciting to diverse audiences. Their energetic style and genre-blending approach have helped redefine the role of the string quartet in contemporary music culture.
