## Biography
Eddie Cantor (born Isidore Itzkowitz; January 31, 1892 – October 10, 1964) was an American comedian, actor, dancer, singer, and songwriter who rose from poverty on the Lower East Side of New York City to become one of the most bankable entertainment stars of the 20th century.[1][3] Beginning his career in his early teens as a singing waiter at Carey Walsh's Coney Island saloon—where a young Jimmy Durante accompanied him on piano—Cantor made his vaudeville debut in 1907 at New York's Clinton Music Hall.[1][5] His breakthrough came in 1912 when vaudeville headliner Gus Edwards recruited him for the Kid Kabaret troupe, where he created his first blackface character "Jefferson."[1][4] This early success caught the attention of Broadway impresario Florenz Ziegfeld, who featured Cantor in Midnight Frolic (1917) and subsequently starred him in iconic Jazz Age musicals including The Follies and Kid Boots.[1][4]

Known affectionately as "Banjo Eyes" for his distinctive large, expressive eyes, Cantor became equally renowned as a singer and comedian.[2] He recorded numerous popular hits including "If You Knew Susie," "Yes, We Have No Bananas," "Yes, Sir, That's My Baby," and "Ma! He's Making Eyes at Me"—songs that captured the spirit of the 1920s.[2] His career expanded dramatically when he entered radio in 1931, replacing Maurice Chevalier as host of The Chase and Sanborn Hour, a position he maintained until 1954 and which made him one of the most popular radio personalities of the era.[1][3][5] During this period, Cantor also achieved major success in Hollywood, starring in Samuel Goldwyn film musicals including Whoopee, Palmy Days, The Kid From Spain, Roman Scandals, Kid Millions, and Strike Me Pink.[3]

Beyond his own performances, Cantor demonstrated remarkable talent as a mentor and talent scout, discovering and nurturing the careers of several major entertainers.[1][5] He was instrumental in launching Dinah Shore, first featuring her on his radio show in 1940, and also helped guide the careers of Deanna Durbin, Bobby Breen, and Eddie Fisher.[1] His influence extended to television, where he hosted The Colgate Comedy Hour from 1950-1955, though a heart attack during this period significantly diminished his energy and transformed his public persona from the energetic performer of his youth to a grandfather figure trading on nostalgia.[2] Cantor's legacy encompasses his pioneering work across vaudeville, Broadway, radio, film, and television—a career that spanned nearly six decades and established him as a foundational figure in American entertainment.

## Fun Facts
- Cantor earned his nickname "Banjo Eyes" due to his distinctive large, rolling eyes that became his trademark feature and comedic asset.[2]
- At age 12, Cantor was the only performer over 20 years old to appear in Gus Edwards' Kid Kabaret in 1912, demonstrating his exceptional talent from an early age.[1]
- During his vaudeville days, Cantor deliberately got himself fired from Bedini's act so he could accept a better opportunity with Gus Edwards' Kid Kabaret, showing his strategic career ambitions.[2]
- Cantor performed as many as five to six times daily during his personal appearance tours, breaking attendance records in most cities where he performed.[5]
