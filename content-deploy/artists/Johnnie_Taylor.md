## Biography
Johnnie Taylor, known as the 'Philosopher of Soul,' was born on May 5, 1934, in Crawfordsville, Arkansas. Raised by his grandmother in West Memphis, he began singing in church at age six, developing a passion for both gospel and blues. As a teenager, Taylor moved to Kansas City and joined the gospel quartet the Melody Kings, later befriending Sam Cooke, who would become a pivotal influence. By the early 1950s, Taylor was recording with the doo-wop group the Five Echoes in Chicago, and soon after, he joined the Highway QCs, a group previously led by Cooke and Lou Rawls. In 1957, Taylor succeeded Cooke as lead singer of the Soul Stirrers, further cementing his reputation in gospel music.

Taylor's transition to secular music began in the early 1960s when he signed with Cooke's SAR label, releasing singles like 'Rome Wasn't Built in a Day.' After SAR folded following Cooke's death, Taylor signed with Stax Records in Memphis in 1966. At Stax, he became one of the label's top-selling artists, blending gospel, R&B, and blues into a distinctive style marked by smooth vocals and emotional depth. His 1968 hit 'Who's Making Love' became a signature song, earning him his first gold record and a Grammy nomination. Taylor's career reached new heights in 1976 with 'Disco Lady,' the first single ever to be certified platinum, solidifying his place in music history.

Throughout a career spanning nearly five decades, Taylor's versatility allowed him to cover a wide range of African-American genres, from gospel and blues to soul and disco. His legacy endures as a trailblazer who bridged sacred and secular music, influencing generations of artists and leaving an indelible mark on American music.
