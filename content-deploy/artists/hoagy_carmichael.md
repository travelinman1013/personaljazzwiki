## Biography
Hoagy Carmichael (born Hoagland Howard Carmichael on November 22, 1899, in Bloomington, Indiana) was a pioneering American composer, pianist, singer, actor, and author. Raised in a musically inclined family—his mother played piano at local movie houses—Carmichael was drawn to jazz from an early age, absorbing influences from both his mother and the vibrant African-American jazz scene in the Midwest. He attended Indiana University, where he studied law and led a jazz band, forging friendships with key jazz musicians such as Bix Beiderbecke. Carmichael’s early compositions, including 'Riverboat Shuffle,' quickly became jazz standards after being recorded by Beiderbecke and the Wolverines in 1924.

After a brief stint practicing law, Carmichael moved to New York City, where he immersed himself in the world of Tin Pan Alley and began composing prolifically. He became known for his innovative, jazz-infused melodies and nostalgic lyrics, penning some of the most enduring songs in American music history, such as 'Stardust,' 'Georgia on My Mind,' 'The Nearness of You,' and 'Heart and Soul.' His collaborations with lyricists like Johnny Mercer yielded hits like 'Lazybones' and the Academy Award-winning 'In the Cool, Cool, Cool of the Evening.' In 1936, Carmichael relocated to Hollywood, where he wrote for films and appeared as a character actor, further cementing his influence on American popular culture.

Carmichael’s legacy is profound: he was among the first singer-songwriters to leverage mass media, and his works became standards performed by countless artists across generations. His melodic inventiveness and ability to blend jazz with popular song forms helped shape the sound of 20th-century American music, making him a central figure in the Great American Songbook.
