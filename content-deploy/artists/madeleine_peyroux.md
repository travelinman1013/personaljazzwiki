## Biography
Madeleine Peyroux is an American jazz singer and songwriter born in Athens, Georgia in 1974. She spent her early childhood in Brooklyn and Southern California, immersed in a household filled with music. Following her parents' divorce, Peyroux moved to Paris with her mother in 1987, a transition that proved pivotal for her musical development. In Paris, she began busking in the Latin Quarter, befriending street musicians and absorbing the city's vibrant musical culture. By age 16, she joined the Lost Wandering Blues & Jazz Band, touring Europe and honing her craft through performances on street corners and small venues, drawing inspiration from classic American jazz and blues artists.[2][3][5]

Peyroux's breakthrough came in 1996 with her debut album 'Dreamland,' which sold over 200,000 copies and garnered critical acclaim for her smoky, emotive vocals reminiscent of Billie Holiday and Ella Fitzgerald. The album featured collaborations with top musicians such as Marc Ribot, Vernon Reid, and Regina Carter, and included renditions of songs by jazz legends like Billie Holiday and Bessie Smith. Her career continued to flourish with appearances at major festivals, tours opening for artists like Cesaria Evora and Sarah McLachlan, and collaborations with the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra.[2][3][8]

In 2003, Peyroux signed with Rounder Records and began a long-standing partnership with Grammy-winning producer Larry Klein, resulting in a series of acclaimed albums including 'Careless Love' (2004). Her style is characterized by a blend of French chanson, vocal jazz, and blues, marked by a deep emotional resonance and interpretive skill. Peyroux's legacy lies in her ability to bridge American jazz traditions with European influences, creating timeless renditions that have earned her a dedicated international following.[2][3][8]
