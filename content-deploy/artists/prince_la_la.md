## Biography
Lawrence Nelson, known professionally as Prince La La, was born in 1936 in the Ninth Ward of New Orleans, Louisiana. He grew up in a musically rich family: his father, Walter Nelson, was a jazz and R&B guitarist, and his brother, Walter 'Papoose' Nelson, played with legendary acts like Fats Domino and Professor Longhair. Immersed in the vibrant New Orleans music scene, Prince La La began his career as a songwriter before stepping into the spotlight as a performer.

Prince La La’s breakthrough came in 1962 when his song 'She Put the Hurt on Me' became the first release for the AFO (All For One) label, quickly rising to number 28 on the Billboard R&B chart. His stage persona, marked by exotic robes and a mystical aura, set him apart and foreshadowed the theatricality later seen in artists like Dr. John. Despite a promising start, his recording career was brief, producing only a handful of singles before his untimely death in 1963 at the age of 27, reportedly from a heroin overdose. His legacy endures as a cult figure in New Orleans R&B, remembered for his unique style and the influence he had on the city’s musical evolution.
