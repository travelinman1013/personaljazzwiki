## Biography
Louis Daniel Armstrong (August 4, 1901 – July 6, 1971), nicknamed 'Satchmo,' 'Satch,' and 'Pops,' was an American trumpeter and vocalist who became one of the most influential figures in jazz history. Born and raised in New Orleans, Armstrong's early life was marked by poverty and hardship, leading to his placement in the Colored Waif's Home where he first learned to play the cornet. After his release in 1914 at age 14, he began playing professionally in brass bands and on Mississippi riverboats, where he developed crucial skills including sight-reading music under the guidance of bandleader Fate Marable.

Armstrong's career truly took off when he moved to Chicago in 1922 to join his mentor Joe 'King' Oliver's Creole Jazz Band. His revolutionary approach shifted jazz from collective improvisation to solo performance, and his recordings with the Hot Five and Hot Seven (1925-1928) established him as the first great jazz soloist. These recordings showcased his explosive creativity, sophisticated harmonic sense, and innovative scat singing technique. By the 1930s, Armstrong had become an international icon, touring extensively and appearing in films while leading various big bands, including Luis Russell's orchestra which served as his backing band for several years.

Armstrong's musical innovations were groundbreaking: he pioneered scat singing, developed a brilliant trumpet technique with an expanded range, and created a swing style that influenced virtually every jazz musician who followed. His career spanned five decades, during which he performed over 300 concerts annually for 30 years and appeared in more than 30 films. His influence crossed genres, earning him inductions into multiple halls of fame including the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1972. In the late 1940s, as big bands declined in popularity, Armstrong formed Louis Armstrong and His All Stars, a small group that remained the driving force of his career until his death in 1971.

## Fun Facts
- Armstrong suffered from severe lip problems throughout his career due to his demanding performance schedule and fondness for playing high C notes on the trumpet, which damaged his lip during a 1932 European tour.
- He was one of the inventors of scat singing, using wordless syllables as a form of vocal improvisation that became a major innovation in jazz music.
- Armstrong performed more than 300 concerts per year for 30 years, making him one of the most prolific live performers in music history.
- His career was managed by Joe Glaser from 1935 until the end of his life, who guided both his musical career and his successful film appearances beginning with 'Pennies from Heaven' in 1936.
