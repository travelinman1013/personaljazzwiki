## Biography
Blue Earth Sound is an experimental jazz group founded and led by Chicago-based multi-instrumentalist, composer, and bandleader James Weir. Originally known for his work in the post-punk and synth-driven bands NE-HI and Spun Out, Weir launched Blue Earth Sound as a personal and creative evolution, seeking to reflect the experiences and musical influences that shaped his late 20s and 30s. The project emerged from a period of introspection, with Weir moving away from the energetic, angst-driven music of his youth toward a more reflective and expansive sound rooted in jazz, soul, and cinematic influences.[1][2][6][8]

The group’s debut album, 'Cicero Nights,' was conceived in Weir’s Humboldt Park basement after he purchased a piano and began composing more intimately. Collaborating with local musicians, including drummer Patch Romanowski, guitarist Michael Wells, flautist and saxophonist Eamonn Prizy, and bassist Martín Diaz, Blue Earth Sound developed a unique style characterized by sweet piano riffs, soulful drums, and blissful flute and brass arrangements. The album was recorded at International Anthem studio in Chicago and features contributions from artists such as Will Miller (trumpet) and longtime collaborator Michael Wells.[1][2][5][8]

Musically, Blue Earth Sound draws inspiration from 1970s Chicago jazz and soul, Talk Talk, Japanese jazz, and Italian soundtrack composers like Stefano Torossi. The result is a fusion of psychedelic, spiritual, and experimental jazz elements that bridge Chicago’s rich musical heritage with a fresh, introspective voice. The group’s work is noted for its intimate, nigh-symphonic arrangements and its ability to evoke both nostalgia and innovation within the contemporary jazz landscape.[1][2][6][7]
