## Biography
Hadley J. Castille was a renowned Cajun fiddler, bandleader, and songwriter from Leonville, Louisiana, widely recognized as one of the finest traditional fiddle voices of southwest Louisiana. Born on March 3, 1933, into a Cajun French-speaking family, he grew up immersed in the region’s rural French culture and music.[1][3][6][8] He learned fiddle from his uncle Cyprien Castille as a boy, but put music aside after enlisting in the U.S. Air Force, returning seriously to the instrument only in midlife as the Cajun cultural revival gathered strength.[3][8] By the 1970s–1980s he had become both a respected tradition-bearer and a dynamic stage performer, noted for his fluent French vocals, storytelling, and historically rooted songs that evoked sharecropping, wartime, and everyday country life.[1][2]

Castille led his own group, most prominently **Hadley Castille & the Louisiana Cajun Band**, and earlier the Sharecroppers Cajun Band, touring widely in the U.S. and abroad as an informal ambassador of Cajun culture.[2][4][5] His recordings for labels such as Swallow and Flat Town featured a mix of driving dance tunes, waltzes, and original ballads that blended traditional Cajun fiddle style with elements of Western swing and country, helping introduce the music to new audiences while remaining deeply rooted in its French Louisiana heritage.[2][4] Honored as a "Living Legend" by Louisiana’s Acadian Museum and celebrated in regional media, he was credited with inspiring younger generations of fiddlers and supporting French language and cultural preservation efforts.[1][2][7] Castille continued performing into his later years and died in 2012 at age 79, leaving a legacy as both a master musician and cultural advocate.[3][4][7]

Within the broader Cajun and zydeco landscape, Hadley Castille & the Louisiana Cajun Band represented a bridge between older dancehall traditions and contemporary festival stages. Their performances often highlighted Castille’s storytelling about rural Acadian life alongside tight ensemble fiddle-led dance music, reinforcing connections between family history, language, and sound.[1][2] Through touring, recordings, and educational outreach, the band helped solidify the fiddle’s central role in modern Cajun ensembles and kept Leonville’s distinct musical flavor alive for international audiences.[2][4]
