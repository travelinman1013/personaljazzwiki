## Biography
Robert Parker is a Swedish electronic musician and producer from Stockholm, Sweden, widely recognized as a leading figure in the synthwave scene[1][4]. Classically trained in piano from the age of six, Parker began experimenting with electronic music as a teenager in the 1990s, creating tracker music on computers—a formative experience that sparked his lifelong passion for retro and analog sounds[3][6]. In 2009, after acquiring a Korg Polysix analog synthesizer, he fully embraced the synthwave genre, blending elements of 1980s pop culture, French house, disco, and chiptune into his own vibrant, groove-driven style[1][3]. His music is characterized by energetic, funky basslines, uplifting melodies, and a distinctively retro-futuristic aesthetic that sets him apart from the often darker, cinematic tendencies of his peers[2][5].

Over his career, Parker has released a series of acclaimed albums and EPs, including his debut 'Drive. Sweat. Play' (2013), 'Money Talks' (2015), and 'Crystal City' (2016), as well as contributing to film soundtracks such as 'Videoman' (2018)[1]. He has performed internationally, bringing his dynamic live sets to audiences across Europe, North America, Asia, and Australia[3]. Parker’s influence extends beyond his recordings: he appeared in the 2019 documentary 'The Rise of the Synths,' which chronicled the growth of the synthwave movement, and his work has been featured in movies, TV series, and video games, further cementing his legacy as a pioneer of modern retro electronic music[1][5]. His ability to fuse nostalgia with contemporary energy has inspired a new wave of artists exploring the intersection of synthwave, funk, and disco[2].
