## Biography
LEISURE (stylized as LEISURE) is a New Zealand electronic and indie-soul collective from Auckland, formed during a spontaneous creative retreat at a holiday house in Muriwai on the West Coast of Auckland in 2015.[3][4] The founding lineup brought together already established musicians and producers Djeisan Suskov, Jaden Parkes, Josh Fountain, Tom Young, and Jordan Arts—later joined by Paul Roper—each of whom had built individual careers in the local scene since the early 2000s in bands such as Goodnight Nurse, Cool Rainbows, Kidz in Space, and others.[3][4] What began as a relaxed week-long writing holiday to escape industry burnout quickly turned into a new project when the group wrote what became their breakout first song, “Got It Bad,” which went viral online and laid the foundation for their self‑titled debut album, released in October 2016.[1][4] That album, developed through recurring weekend and holiday-house sessions, gradually amassed over 100 million Spotify streams and established LEISURE as one of Aotearoa’s most successful streaming-era acts of the 2010s.[4]  

Musically, LEISURE are known for a smooth, atmospheric sound that blends electronic pop with elements of funk, 1990s boom-bap and R&B, and early‑2000s dance-pop, often described as laid‑back, escapist, and sensual.[1][3][5] Their collaborative process emphasizes low-pressure, vibe‑driven sessions, with all members contributing songwriting, production, and mixing skills, which allows them to self‑produce and refine their work in-house.[1][5] Over successive releases—including their debut, subsequent albums such as *Sunsetter* and *Leisurevision*, and a growing catalogue of EPs and singles—the group have developed a consistent aesthetic that has translated strongly to the sync world and international touring, with hundreds of millions of streams and festival appearances, including a Laneway Festival slot early in their career.[4][5][6] While still in mid‑career rather than a retrospective “legacy” phase, LEISURE have already become a key reference point in New Zealand’s modern alt‑R&B and indie‑soul landscape, demonstrating how a relaxed, collective-first approach can produce globally resonant, highly polished pop.

## Fun Facts
- LEISURE effectively began as a “writing holiday”: drummer and industry A&R figure Jaden Parkes booked a Muriwai beach house with no fixed agenda, and the band was born from a week of informal jams rather than a planned project.[1][4]
- Their first song together, “Got It Bad,” was written during that initial seven‑day retreat and went viral almost immediately, convincing them to continue as a proper group.[1]
- Before forming LEISURE, the members had already tasted success in diverse projects: Parkes played in pop‑punk band Goodnight Nurse, Suskov led psych‑indie projects like Cool Rainbows, and Fountain worked in EDM/hip‑hop outfit Kidz in Space and later produced for pop artist Benee.[3][4]
- LEISURE’s laid‑back sound and strong production have made them a staple in music sync licensing, helping their tracks reach global audiences beyond traditional radio and touring.[5]
