## Biography
Wizkid, born Ayodeji Ibrahim Balogun on July 16, 1990, in Surulere, Lagos State, Nigeria, is one of the most influential figures in contemporary Afrobeats. He began his musical journey as a child, singing in his church choir and later joining the local group Glorious Five. His early exposure to a blend of Nigerian pop, R&B, and gospel laid the foundation for his genre-defying sound. Wizkid rose to prominence in the early 2010s with hits like 'Holla at Your Boy' and 'Tease Me/Bad Guys,' establishing himself as a leading voice in the Afrobeats movement. His collaborations with international artists, including Drake and Beyoncé, have helped bring African music to a global audience. Damian Marley, born Damian Robert Nesta Marley on July 21, 1978, in Kingston, Jamaica, is a Grammy-winning reggae artist and the youngest son of Bob Marley. He began his career as a child, performing with his family and later releasing his debut album 'Mr. Marley' at age 12. Damian is known for his socially conscious lyrics and fusion of reggae, hip-hop, and dancehall. His work with Wizkid, notably on the track 'Blessed' from the 'Made in Lagos' album, exemplifies a cross-cultural musical synergy that bridges African and Caribbean sounds. Together, Wizkid and Damian Marley have become symbols of global Afro-Caribbean collaboration, influencing a new generation of artists and fans worldwide.
