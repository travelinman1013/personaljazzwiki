## Biography
Erskine Hawkins was an American trumpeter, composer, and big band leader whose orchestra is often referred to simply as the **Erskine Hawkins Big Band**. Born Erskine Ramsay Hawkins on July 26, 1914, in Birmingham, Alabama, he lost his father, a soldier, in World War I and grew up in a musically rich environment shaped in part by Birmingham’s vibrant nightlife.[4][1] He began on drums at about age seven, moved to trombone, and settled on trumpet at thirteen, eventually earning the nickname **“The 20th Century Gabriel”** for his powerful high-note playing and flamboyant style.[4][3][6] At Industrial High School in Birmingham he excelled in music, and as a teenager he went on to Alabama State Teachers College in Montgomery (now Alabama State University), where he joined and soon led the school band, the ‘Bama State Collegians.[1][3]

In 1934 Hawkins, then about 20, took the Collegians on a fundraising tour to the Northeast that proved so successful—especially at Harlem’s Savoy Ballroom—that the group turned professional, broke from the college, and relocated to New York.[1][3][5] By 1936 they had made their recording debut, and by 1938 they were formally known as the **Erskine Hawkins Orchestra**, one of the era’s notable swing and big band outfits.[2][4] Working regularly at the Savoy Ballroom (eventually as a house band alternating with Chick Webb’s orchestra), the Hawkins band developed a driving yet danceable swing style built around tight ensemble work, blues-inflected solos, and Hawkins’s soaring trumpet lines.[1][3] They scored major hits with **“Tuxedo Junction,” “After Hours,” and “Tippin’ In,”** with “Tuxedo Junction” becoming a World War II–era standard and their lasting signature tune.[2][4] Although some contemporary critics dismissed the band as flashy or derivative, Hawkins maintained a loyal audience—especially among African American listeners—and managed to keep his big band intact into the early 1950s, outlasting many peers as tastes shifted toward rhythm and blues.[1][4]

Over time, Hawkins’s sound absorbed more **R&B** elements, and he continued performing, recording, and touring in various formats after the big band’s commercial peak, including a 1971 reunion album, *Live at Club Soul Sound*.[4] His orchestra became a training ground for numerous important jazz and R&B musicians, and Hawkins himself exerted a documented influence on emerging artists such as Ray Charles, particularly in the blend of swing, blues, and rhythm that underpinned early R&B.[4] Recognized in his home state as a foundational figure, he was among the first inductees into the **Alabama Jazz Hall of Fame** and entered the Alabama Music Hall of Fame in 1989.[4] Hawkins died on November 11, 1993, in Willingboro, New Jersey, but the legacy of the Erskine Hawkins Big Band endures through its recordings and its central place in the swing and big band tradition.[4][6]

## Fun Facts
- Hawkins’s signature hit “Tuxedo Junction” was inspired by a real Birmingham neighborhood nightspot and a stop on the Black touring circuit; it became a massive swing standard after both his band and Glenn Miller’s orchestra recorded it.[4][5]
- Because of his powerful high-note trumpet playing, Hawkins was nicknamed “The 20th Century Gabriel,” a reference to the archangel Gabriel often depicted with a trumpet.[1][4]
- The Erskine Hawkins Orchestra became the house band at Harlem’s Savoy Ballroom, alternating sets with Chick Webb’s famous band so that dancers enjoyed continuous live music.[1]
- Hawkins managed to keep his big band together until 1953—longer than many of his swing-era peers—despite the postwar decline of big band popularity and the rise of smaller R&B groups.[2][4]
