## Biography
Johnny Sansone, born September 27, 1957, in Orange, New Jersey, is a celebrated American blues singer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist known for his mastery of the harmonica, accordion, guitar, and piano. Raised in a musical household—his father played saxophone with Dave Brubeck’s band during World War II—Sansone began learning saxophone at age eight and soon picked up guitar and harmonica. A formative moment came at age twelve when he saw Howlin’ Wolf perform, cementing his lifelong dedication to the blues. He further honed his craft under the guidance of blues harmonica legends James Cotton and Junior Wells, and by age thirteen, he was sitting in with blues greats like Honeyboy Edwards.

Sansone’s career is marked by restless exploration and a deep connection to American roots music. He spent his early professional years backing Chicago blues icons such as Jimmy Rogers, Robert Jr. Lockwood, and John Lee Hooker, and fronted Ronnie Earl’s Broadcasters in the 1980s. After moving between Colorado, Austin, Florida, and Chicago, he settled in New Orleans in 1990, where the city’s vibrant musical culture profoundly shaped his sound. Inspired by the funeral of zydeco legend Clifton Chenier, Sansone added accordion to his repertoire, blending swamp rock, Cajun, and zydeco influences into his blues foundation. His 1997 album 'Crescent City Moon' earned widespread acclaim and multiple awards, solidifying his reputation as a leading figure in modern blues and Louisiana roots music.

Over a career spanning four decades, Sansone has released more than a dozen albums and garnered numerous accolades, including a Grammy nomination, a Blues Music Award, a Juno Award, and multiple 'Best of the Beat' and 'Big Easy' awards. He is a founding member of the Voice of the Wetlands All Stars, collaborating with New Orleans legends like Dr. John, Cyril Neville, and Tab Benoit. Sansone’s dynamic stage presence, innovative songwriting, and commitment to musical authenticity have made him a vital force in contemporary blues and roots music.
