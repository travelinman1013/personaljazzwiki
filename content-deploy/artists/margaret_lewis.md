## Biography
Margaret Ann Lewis (later Margaret Lewis Warwick), born on April 30, 1939, in Snyder, Texas, grew up immersed in music, singing in her local Baptist church and forming her first high school band, The Thunderbolts (also spelled Tunderbolts). Her career launched in 1957 when she was discovered by country star Johnny Horton after winning a talent show in Lubbock, Texas, amid the West Texas musical boom of the 1950s. She moved to Shreveport, Louisiana, recording obscure rockabilly and bluesy swamp pop singles for the small Ram label in the late 1950s, blending rockabilly with down-home blues, gospel, and country-soul—a rarity for female artists at the time.[1][2][4][5][6][7]

In the late 1950s, Lewis provided backup vocals for Dale Hawkins both on stage and in the studio, and later recorded with Johnny Winter in New Orleans (tracks issued in 1995). After Ram folded in the early 1960s, she recorded for Capitol in the mid-1960s and performed in Las Vegas clubs. Transitioning to songwriting, she partnered with Ram owner Mira Smith (who had played guitar and co-written on her Ram sides), penning country hits for artists like Margaret Whiting ('I Almost Called Your Name'), Daniel Houston ('Mountain of Love'), Jeannie C. Riley ('Country Girl,' 'The Girl Most Likely,' 'The Rib,' 'The Singer'), Connie Francis ('Wedding Cake'), and Peggy Scott & Jo Jo Benson ('Soul Shake'). A compilation of her Ram-era work, 'Lonesome Bluebird,' was released by Ace Records in 1995.[1][6]

Lewis passed away on March 29, 2019, in Shreveport, Louisiana, leaving a legacy as a pioneering female rockabilly and country singer-songwriter and music entrepreneur whose versatile style bridged genres and eras.[3][6]
