## Biography
The Supremes were an American vocal group formed in Detroit, Michigan, in 1959, originally known as The Primettes. The founding members—Florence Ballard, Mary Wilson, Diana Ross, and Betty McGlown—grew up in the Brewster-Douglass public housing project and began as a sister act to The Primes, who later became The Temptations. After signing with Motown Records in 1961 and shortening their name to The Supremes, the group underwent several lineup changes, with Ross, Ballard, and Wilson becoming the classic trio. Their early years were marked by modest success, but with the songwriting and production team Holland–Dozier–Holland, they achieved mainstream stardom in the mid-1960s, scoring 12 number-one singles on the Billboard Hot 100 and becoming Motown's premier act.

The Supremes' sound blended pop, soul, and R&B, characterized by sophisticated harmonies, polished production, and glamorous presentation. Their crossover appeal helped break down racial barriers in the music industry, making them one of the most successful American vocal groups of all time. In 1967, the group was renamed Diana Ross & the Supremes, reflecting Ross's central role, and after her departure in 1970, the group continued with new members until disbanding in 1977. The Supremes' legacy endures as pioneers of the Motown sound and as trailblazers for African-American artists in popular music.
