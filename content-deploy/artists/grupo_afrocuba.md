## Biography
Grupo Afrocuba is a pioneering Cuban jazz ensemble formed in Havana in 1977 under the direction of saxophonist Nicolás Reinoso. The group emerged during a period of artistic experimentation, aiming to fuse the deep roots of Cuban music with jazz, resulting in a distinctive and innovative sound. Early members included notable musicians such as the Acosta brothers (Carlos and Fernando), guitarist René Luis Toledo, bassist Ángel Luis López, pianist Ernán López-Nussa, drummer Tony Valdés, percussionists Mario Luis Pino and Anselmo Febles, and trumpeter Roberto García. Their technical mastery and creative drive quickly set them apart, earning them the First Prize at the V Concurso de la Sección de Música de la Unión de Escritores y Artistas de Cuba just a year after their founding.

Afrocuba underwent several artistic phases, marked by both internal changes and external challenges, including political censorship and restrictions typical of Cuba's 'quinquenio gris' (the 'grey five-year period' of cultural repression in the 1970s). After Reinoso's departure, leadership passed to flautist and keyboardist Oriente López, who maintained the band's commitment to musical fusion and innovation. In the mid-1980s, Afrocuba entered a celebrated collaborative period with Nueva Trova singer-songwriter Silvio Rodríguez, contributing to three acclaimed albums and further expanding their influence in Cuban popular and concert music. Despite lineup changes and the eventual departure of key members, the group remained a touchstone of Cuban jazz until its dissolution in 1997.

Afrocuba's legacy lies in its role as a bridge between Cuban musical tradition and contemporary jazz, inspiring generations of musicians and maintaining an iconic status within Cuban music history. Their work is celebrated for its harmonic complexity, rhythmic innovation, and the way it captured the spirit of a generation navigating both artistic aspiration and political constraint.
