## Biography
Nubya Nyasha Garcia, born in 1991 in Camden Town, London, is a British saxophonist, composer, DJ, and bandleader recognized as a leading figure in the contemporary UK jazz scene. Raised in a musically rich environment by a Guyanese mother and a British Trinidadian father, Garcia was exposed to a wide array of genres from an early age. She began her musical journey at the Camden Saturday Music Centre, first learning violin and viola before switching to saxophone at age ten. Her early education included time with the London Schools Symphony Orchestra and the Camden Jazz Band, and she later attended the Royal Academy of Music’s junior jazz program, Tomorrow’s Warriors, and the Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance, from which she graduated in 2016.

Garcia's career accelerated with the release of her debut EP 'Nubya’s 5ive' in 2017, followed by 'When We Are' in 2018, both of which garnered critical acclaim and established her as a vital new voice in jazz. Her debut album 'Source' (2020) blended African, Caribbean, Latin American, and electronic influences, earning international recognition and a Mercury Prize shortlist. Garcia is celebrated for her powerful, groove-oriented sound and her ability to merge traditional jazz with modern genres, as heard on her subsequent releases and collaborations. She has performed at major festivals worldwide, held a DJ residency on NTS Radio, and headlined prestigious venues such as Ronnie Scott’s Jazz Club and the BBC Proms.

Garcia’s legacy is marked by her role in revitalizing the London jazz scene, her innovative approach to composition and performance, and her commitment to collaboration. She is known for working with prominent artists like Makaya McCraven, Moses Boyd, and Shabaka Hutchings, and for inspiring a new generation of jazz musicians with her eclectic style and dedication to musical exploration.
