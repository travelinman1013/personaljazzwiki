## Biography
The Five Keys were a pioneering American rhythm and blues vocal group formed in 1945 in Newport News, Virginia. Originally known as the Sentimental Four, the group began as a gospel quartet comprised of two sets of brothers—Rudy and Bernie West, and Ripley and Raphael Ingram—who were childhood friends and classmates. Their early years were marked by local performances and amateur contests, gradually transitioning from gospel to secular R&B as their sound evolved and new members joined, including Maryland Pierce and James 'Dickie' Smith. By 1949, following Raphael Ingram's departure, the group adopted the name The Five Keys and began to develop their signature blend of doo-wop, boogie-woogie, and early rock influences.

The Five Keys signed with Aladdin Records in 1951, achieving their first major hit with a cover of 'The Glory of Love,' which topped the US R&B charts. Their sound was characterized by smooth harmonies, innovative vocal arrangements, and the 'floating tenor' style, particularly through Ripley Ingram. In 1954, the group moved to Capitol Records, where they embraced a more pop-oriented style with fuller instrumentation, resulting in crossover hits like 'Ling, Ting, Tong.' Despite frequent lineup changes due to military service and personal circumstances, the Five Keys maintained a high level of artistry and continued to influence the vocal group genre throughout the 1950s. Their legacy was cemented with their induction into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2002, recognizing their foundational role in shaping doo-wop and R&B vocal harmony.
