## Biography
Ina Ray Hutton, born Odessa Cowan on March 13, 1916, in Chicago, Illinois, was a pioneering American bandleader, singer, and dancer, best known for leading one of the first all-female big bands, the Melodears. Raised in a musical family—her mother, Marvel Ray, was a professional pianist—Hutton began performing on stage at age eight and appeared in Broadway revues throughout her teens, including the Ziegfeld Follies of 1934. In 1934, with the encouragement of music publisher Irving Mills and agent Alex Hyde, she changed her name and formed Ina Ray Hutton and Her Melodears, an all-women swing orchestra that quickly gained national attention for their energetic performances and glamorous style.

The Melodears, featuring musicians such as trumpeter Frances Klein and pianist Ruth Lowe, became one of the first all-female bands to be recorded and filmed, appearing in short films and the feature 'Big Broadcast of 1936.' Despite making relatively few recordings, the group’s visibility in film and radio helped break gender barriers in jazz and swing. After the Melodears disbanded in 1939, Hutton led an all-male orchestra through the 1940s, appearing in the film 'Ever Since Venus' (1944) and recording for Elite and Okeh labels. In the 1950s, she returned to leading all-female bands, starring in 'The Ina Ray Hutton Show' on television. Hutton retired from music in 1968 and died in 1984 from complications of diabetes.

Hutton’s musical style was rooted in swing and up-tempo jazz, and her leadership and showmanship paved the way for future generations of women in jazz. Her legacy endures as a trailblazer who challenged conventions and brought all-female ensembles to the forefront of American music.
