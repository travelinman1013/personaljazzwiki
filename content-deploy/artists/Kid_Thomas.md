## Biography
Louis Thomas Watts, better known as Kid Thomas, was born on June 20, 1934, in Sturgis, Mississippi. His family relocated to Chicago when he was a child, where he immersed himself in the vibrant local blues scene. Initially a drummer, Thomas soon gravitated toward the harmonica, taking lessons from Little Willie Smith in exchange for drum instruction. By his teenage years, he was a fixture in Chicago clubs, sitting in with legends like Muddy Waters, Elmore James, and Bo Diddley, and occasionally substituting for his hero Little Walter when needed.

Kid Thomas's career was marked by a restless search for recognition. In the late 1950s, after a period performing in Wichita, Kansas with Hound Dog Taylor, he moved to Los Angeles, hoping to emulate the success of Little Richard. There, he recorded the explosive single "Rockin' This Joint To-Nite" for George Motola's Transcontinental Records, a track now considered a wild classic of early rock & roll, though it failed to chart. He continued to perform under various monikers, including Tommy Louis and the Rhythm Rockers, and recorded several more singles throughout the 1960s, but commercial success eluded him. Despite his energetic performances and innovative harmonica style, Kid Thomas remained largely underappreciated during his lifetime. He died tragically in Beverly Hills, California, on April 5, 1970, after a shooting incident, and his passing went almost unnoticed in the blues community due to confusion over his legal name.

Kid Thomas's music bridged the gap between blues and rock & roll, characterized by raw harmonica playing, impassioned vocals, and a frenetic stage presence. His legacy endures among aficionados as an unsung hero who contributed to the evolution of American roots music, influencing later generations of blues and rock musicians.

## Fun Facts
- Kid Thomas sometimes deputized for his idol Little Walter when Walter was too intoxicated to perform.
- He recorded his first single, "Wolf Pack," as an ad-lib inspired by Howlin' Wolf, and "The Spell" was influenced by Screamin' Jay Hawkins.
- He performed under several aliases, including Tommy Louis and Tommy Lewis, and led bands such as the Rhythm Rockers and the Versatiles.
- Despite his talent, many of his recordings remained unreleased during his lifetime, and his death was barely noted in the blues community due to confusion over his legal name.
