## Biography
Eilen Jewell, born April 6, 1979, in Boise, Idaho, is an acclaimed American singer-songwriter known for her evocative blend of Americana, alt-country, and blues. Raised in Boise, she attended St. John's College in Santa Fe, New Mexico, where she began her musical journey busking on the streets. After stints performing in Los Angeles and Boston, Jewell established herself in the Massachusetts roots scene before returning to her hometown in 2015—a move that inspired her album 'Sundown Over Ghost Town.'[1][2]

Jewell's career is marked by a relentless touring ethic and a series of critically lauded albums, including 'Boundary County,' 'Letters from Sinners & Strangers,' and 'Queen of the Minor Key.' Her music is characterized by a 'vintage roots-noir' sound, often drawing comparisons to artists like Neko Case and Billie Holiday for her clear, expressive voice and clever songwriting. Jewell's stylistic range encompasses early rock, rockabilly, country, and soul, with her 2023 album 'Get Behind the Wheel' exploring more psychedelic territory and themes of grief, resilience, and personal rebirth following a period of profound personal upheaval.[1][2][3]

Over nearly two decades, Jewell has built a devoted following through her dynamic live performances and her ability to transform heartache into creative expression. She has shared stages with legends such as Lucinda Williams, Loretta Lynn, and Mavis Staples, and is recognized as one of America's most intriguing and idiosyncratic voices in contemporary roots music.[2]
