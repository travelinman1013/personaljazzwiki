## Biography
Helen Gillet is a Belgian-born cellist, singer, composer, and improviser celebrated for her genre-defying approach to music. Raised in Singapore, Chicago, and Wisconsin, Gillet’s multicultural upbringing exposed her to a diverse array of musical traditions from an early age. She began her formal studies in classical cello performance, ultimately earning her master’s degree from Loyola University in New Orleans in 2004. Drawn to the city’s vibrant and eclectic music scene, she made New Orleans her home in 2002, quickly immersing herself in its jazz, funk, and experimental communities.

Gillet’s career is marked by her innovative use of live looping technology, allowing her to layer cello, vocals, and percussive elements in real time to create richly textured solo performances. Her musical style is a unique fusion of avant-garde jazz, French chansons, funk, folk, alternative rock, and classical, often incorporating improvisational techniques inspired by her studies in North Indian Hindustani music. She has performed at major festivals and venues worldwide, including the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, Lincoln Center, and the Kennedy Center, and has collaborated with a wide range of artists across genres. Gillet is recognized not only for her technical mastery and improvisational prowess but also for her role in expanding the cello’s presence in jazz and experimental music.
