## Biography
Smilin' Myron is a New Orleans–based jam and funk band that emerged out of the city’s vibrant college and club scene in the 1990s. Formed while core members were students at Tulane University, the group built its reputation in the local circuit by blending groove‑heavy funk, rock, and improvisational jamming, earning a devoted following in what OffBeat Magazine described as an already “very busy music town.”[1][4] Their sound fit alongside the broader national rise of jam‑friendly, genre‑blending bands of the era, but Smilin’ Myron distinguished itself through tight, song‑oriented writing coupled with extended live improvisations that made them a staple of New Orleans clubs and regional festivals.[1]

A central figure in the band was guitarist, vocalist, and songwriter Tim Guarisco, who was born in Morgan City, Louisiana and moved to New Orleans to attend Tulane; it was during this period that Smilin’ Myron first took shape.[4] Over time, the band’s energetic live performances and steady presence on the local scene solidified its status as a cult favorite among fans of New Orleans funk and jam music, even if they never achieved mainstream national recognition.[1] Guarisco’s death from cancer was later noted in OffBeat as a major loss for the group and its community, underscoring his role in defining Smilin’ Myron’s sound and spirit.[4] Although detailed discography information is limited in public sources, the band is remembered primarily for its live shows and for contributing to the summer funk and jam culture of New Orleans in the late 1990s and 2000s.[1][4]
