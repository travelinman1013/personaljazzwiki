## Biography
Clarence Williams was born in Plaquemine, Louisiana, likely in 1898, though some sources cite earlier dates. Of Choctaw and Creole heritage, he grew up in the vibrant musical environment of New Orleans, where his father was a bass player and hotel owner. Williams began performing as a child, singing in the streets and entertaining guests at his family's hotel. At age 12, he joined Billy Kersands's minstrel show, quickly becoming its master of ceremonies, which honed his skills as a performer and organizer.[4]

Returning to New Orleans, Williams played piano in Storyville's honky-tonks and managed cabarets, while also starting a suit cleaning business. He soon partnered with Armand J. Piron to launch a music publishing company, and later with Spencer Williams (no relation) to copyright and publish jazz and blues hits like 'Royal Garden Blues' and 'None Of My Jelly Roll.' By the 1920s, Williams had moved to New York, where he became a prolific composer, bandleader, and music publisher. He assembled influential recording groups such as the Blue Five, featuring Louis Armstrong and Sidney Bechet, and worked closely with his wife, vocalist Eva Taylor. Williams was instrumental in bringing Bessie Smith to Columbia Records and managing her early career.[1][2][3][5]

Williams's musical style blended ragtime, early jazz, blues, and swing, characterized by catchy melodies and strong rhythmic drive. His catalog includes classics like 'Baby, Won't You Please Come Home,' 'West End Blues,' and 'Sugar Blues.' As a publisher and A&R man, he directed production for nearly a thousand records, shaping the sound of early jazz. Williams's legacy endures through his compositions, his pioneering role as an African American music entrepreneur, and his influence on generations of jazz musicians.[1][3][6]
