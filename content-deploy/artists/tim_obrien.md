## Biography
Timothy O'Brien was born on March 16, 1954, in Wheeling, West Virginia, where he grew up singing in church and school. His musical journey began at age twelve when he received his first guitar as a birthday gift, quickly mastering the instrument by playing along with Chet Atkins records. After seeing Doc Watson perform on television, O'Brien became a lifelong devotee of old-time and bluegrass music. He graduated from Linsly Military Institute High School in 1974 and briefly attended Colby College in Maine before relocating to Colorado, where his professional career truly launched.

In 1978, O'Brien co-founded Hot Rize with guitarist Charles Sawtelle, banjoist Pete Wernick, and bassist Nick Forster, becoming one of America's most innovative and entertaining bluegrass bands over their twelve-year tenure. The band earned critical acclaim for their fresh harmony singing, melodic instrumentation, and O'Brien's rhythmic drive, winning the International Bluegrass Music Association's first Entertainer of the Year award in 1990. During this period, O'Brien wrote bluegrass hits including "Walk the Way the Wind Blows" and "Untold Stories," which were later covered as country hits by Kathy Mattea, with whom he dueted on the 1990 Country Top Ten single "Battle Hymn of Love."

Following Hot Rize's dissolution, O'Brien established himself as a prolific solo artist and collaborator, earning multiple Grammy Awards and IBMA Male Vocalist of the Year honors in 1993 and 2006. His diverse discography spans bluegrass, folk, Americana, and Celtic-Appalachian fusion, with his songs covered by major artists including Garth Brooks, The Chicks, Nickel Creek, and Steve Earle. In 2013, he was inducted into the West Virginia Music Hall of Fame. Throughout his nearly fifty-year career, O'Brien has served as a bridge between traditional hill country sounds and modern bluegrass and Americana styles, collaborating with artists such as Mark Knopfler, Dan Auerbach, Sturgill Simpson, and Steve Martin, while maintaining an active touring schedule across the United States, Europe, Japan, South America, Australia, and New Zealand.
