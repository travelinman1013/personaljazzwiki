## Biography
Sonny Boy Williamson refers to two influential blues musicians: John Lee Williamson and Rice Miller. John Lee Williamson, born on March 30, 1914, in Jackson, Tennessee, was a pivotal figure in the blues genre. He was known for his harmonica skills and songwriting, becoming a staple in the St. Louis blues scene before contributing to the Chicago blues movement. His first recording, 'Good Morning, School Girl,' released in 1937, marked a shift in the role of harmonica players in blues. Tragically, Williamson’s life was cut short in 1948 due to a violent attack. Rice Miller, born near Glendora, Mississippi, adopted the name Sonny Boy Williamson II after John Lee's death. He was a charismatic performer and one of the greatest harmonica players, known for his poetic compositions and influential recordings like 'Help Me' and 'Eyesight to the Blind.' Miller's career spanned from the 1920s until his death in 1965. Both Sonny Boy Williamsons left a lasting impact on blues music, with their styles influencing generations of musicians. Their legacy includes contributions to the development of blues and its evolution into various sub-genres like blues rock.
