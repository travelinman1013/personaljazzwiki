## Biography
Mark Lettieri is a highly acclaimed American guitarist, composer, and producer, celebrated for his dynamic work in jazz fusion, funk, and instrumental music. Born in the San Francisco Bay Area in 1983, Lettieri began playing guitar at age 12, drawing early inspiration from legends like Jimi Hendrix and Joe Satriani. He honed his skills through formal jazz lessons and self-guided study, playing along with recordings and performing in local bands. After studying marketing at Texas Christian University in Fort Worth, Texas, Lettieri immersed himself in the Dallas-Fort Worth music scene, where his versatility allowed him to thrive in genres ranging from R&B and gospel to country and rock.

Lettieri’s professional breakthrough came in 2008 when he joined the jazz fusion collective Snarky Puppy, contributing as a guitarist, arranger, and composer. His tenure with the group has resulted in five Grammy Awards, including for albums like 'Sylva,' 'Culcha Vulcha,' and 'Empire Central.' He is also a founding member of The Fearless Flyers, an instrumental supergroup featuring Cory Wong, Joe Dart, and Nate Smith. Alongside his band work, Lettieri has released numerous solo albums, such as 'Knows,' 'Spark and Echo,' and 'Deep: The Baritone Sessions Vol. 2,' the latter earning him a Grammy nomination as a solo artist. His style is recognized for its textural depth and groove-driven approach, always prioritizing the needs of the song.

Beyond his own projects, Lettieri is a sought-after session and touring musician, collaborating with artists like Erykah Badu, David Crosby, Kirk Franklin, and Ledisi. He leads the Mark Lettieri Group, performing globally and continuing to influence the modern jazz and fusion landscape through his innovative playing and compositional voice.
