## Biography
Afroskull is a funk‑rock/jazz‑rock collective originally formed in **New Orleans, Louisiana, in 1997**, later relocating to **New York City** and integrating into the Brooklyn scene.[5][3][8][1] The band grew out of house‑party jam sessions and local gigs in New Orleans, where guitarist and producer **Joe Scatassa** and drummer **Jason Isaac** began shaping a sound that fused heavy rock riffs with second‑line funk grooves, jazz harmony, and a horn‑driven attack.[3][7][8] Early on, Afroskull cultivated a raucous live reputation, described as a "sonic gumbo" that reflected their Crescent City roots—equal parts greasy funk, classic rock power, and off‑kilter humor.[8] Their debut full‑length "Monster for the Masses" (2000) introduced this aesthetic on record, featuring original instrumental compositions that highlighted tight ensemble playing and extended improvisation.[5][6]

In the mid‑2000s Afroskull moved operations to New York, gradually evolving from a New Orleans club act into a Brooklyn‑based funk‑rock "superproject" with an expanded, rotating lineup of rhythm section and horns.[5][1][8] Anchored by founding members Scatassa and Isaac, the group released the EP "Born Electric" (2007) and the full‑length "To Obscurity and Beyond" (2010), the latter earning coverage in jamband and progressive‑rock circles for its mix of vintage heavy rock, odd‑meter funk, and jazz‑fusion sensibilities.[7][2][6] Critics and archives now classify Afroskull as a **jazz‑related rock / jazz‑rock fusion** and **progressive rock** artist, while fan descriptions emphasize their blend of old‑school New Orleans funk with aggressive guitar tones and elaborate arrangements.[2][6][5] Though never a mainstream act, Afroskull has maintained a cult following, with their recordings and live shows cited as distinctive contributions to the late‑1990s and 2000s intersection of funk, rock, and improvisational music.[7][8]

Afroskull’s musical style is marked by **instrumental, groove‑driven compositions**, horn sections, and a penchant for complex but accessible arrangements that nod to 1970s funk, classic rock, and jazz‑fusion pioneers.[5][2][6] Their legacy rests on bridging the cultural worlds of New Orleans and New York, carrying the rhythmic feel and playful spirit of the Crescent City into the more hard‑edged, experimental environment of Brooklyn’s underground scene.[3][8][1] Although information on later activity is limited, their small but focused discography—especially "To Obscurity and Beyond"—continues to circulate on niche platforms and archives, preserving Afroskull as a vivid example of regional funk traditions meeting progressive rock ambition at the turn of the 21st century.[2][6][7]
