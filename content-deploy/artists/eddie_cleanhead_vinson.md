## Biography
Eddie “Cleanhead” Vinson (born Edward L. Vinson Jr.) was an American alto saxophonist, blues shouter, and composer whose work bridged jump blues, swing, bebop, jazz, and early R&B. Born on December 18, 1917, in Houston, Texas, he grew up in a musical household where his father played piano in local honky-tonks, and he began playing alto saxophone as a child.[1][2][7][9] While still in school he attracted the attention of local bandleaders and joined Chester Boone’s Houston territory band, which later became Milton (Milt) Larkins’s renowned but unrecorded outfit; through this ensemble he toured the Midwest and backed major blues artists such as T-Bone Walker and Big Bill Broonzy.[1][2][7] Broonzy, whom Vinson credited as “the man who really taught me the blues,” helped shape his approach to blues shouting, even as Vinson was honing a jazz-oriented technique influenced by the emerging bebop movement.[1][2]

In the early 1940s Vinson was recruited by trumpeter Cootie Williams for his new big band in New York, making his recording debut in 1942 as a vocalist on “When My Baby Left Me” for OKeh Records and scoring a hit with “Cherry Red” in 1945.[1][2][9] Leaving Williams in 1945–46, he formed his own big band and then smaller groups, recording for labels including Capitol and Mercury and becoming a leading figure in jump blues with hits such as “Kidney Stew Blues,” “Juice Head Baby,” and “Old Maid Boogie,” noted for their suggestive, often too-raunchy-for-radio lyrics and his distinctive wheezy Texas vocal style.[1][3][6][9] In the late 1940s he folded the big band and led a sextet that, at one point, included a young John Coltrane on tenor saxophone, and he continued to fuse blues feeling with bebop-inflected alto lines.[1][3] After a period of reduced visibility in the 1950s, he gained renewed recognition in the 1960s and 1970s through collaborations and festivals, including exposure via Cannonball Adderley, European touring, and recordings such as “Kidney Stew Is Fine,” remaining active into the 1980s until his death on July 2, 1988, in Los Angeles, California.[1][3][5][9]

Vinson’s musical style was defined by his ability to straddle and connect genres: he was equally persuasive as a hard-swinging, bebop-savvy alto saxist and as a gritty blues shouter, employing humor, double entendres, and stage charisma.[2][3][6][8] Known for his crisp, biting tone and melodic, riff-based phrasing, he influenced both blues and jazz players and contributed tunes that entered the standards repertoire, such as “Kidney Stew Blues” and the riff later adapted into “Four” and “Tune Up,” although authorship of those jazz standards has been disputed.[3][5][9] His nickname “Cleanhead” reportedly came from an early mishap with a lye-based hair-straightening (conk) preparation that burned his hair off, a look he then adopted as a trademark bald-headed image.[2][3][7][9] Inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 2001, Vinson is remembered as a key figure who helped define jump blues and demonstrated the deep kinship between jazz improvisation and the blues tradition.[3][7][9]

## Fun Facts
- Vinson earned the nickname “Cleanhead” after a lye-based hair-straightening compound burned off his hair; he embraced the resulting bald look as his signature image.[2][3][7][9]
- He was a rare double threat in his era, widely praised both as a technically accomplished bebop-influenced alto saxophonist and as a powerful blues shouter with a wheezy rasp and falsetto yelp.[2][3][6]
- Many of his jump-blues songs were considered too raunchy for radio, with double entendres and humorous, no-holds-barred lyrics in tunes like “Some Women Do,” “Oil Man Blues,” and “Ever-Ready Blues.”[1][6]
- He has been linked to the origins of jazz standards such as “Four” and “Tune Up,” with some sources crediting him as the true composer, though these attributions remain disputed among historians.[3][5][9]

## Musical Connections

### Mentors/Influences
- [[big_bill_broonzy|Big Bill Broonzy]] - Blues singer-guitarist who taught Vinson how to “shout the blues” and deeply shaped his concept of blues singing; Vinson later credited him publicly as the man who really taught him the blues. (Broonzy’s song “Just a Dream,” which Vinson recorded and performed as one of his early hits.) [Late 1930s–1940s touring years with Milton Larkins’s band and subsequent collaborations.[1][2]]

### Key Collaborators
- [[cootie_williams|Cootie Williams]] - Trumpeter and bandleader who hired Vinson for his big band, featuring him as a vocalist and saxophonist on several recordings that helped establish Vinson’s national reputation. (Recordings for OKeh including “When My Baby Left Me” (1942) and the hit “Cherry Red” (1945).) [Circa 1942–1945 with the Cootie Williams Orchestra.[1][2][9]]
- [[milton_milt_larkins|Milton (Milt) Larkins]] - Leader of a prominent territory band in which Vinson developed as an alto saxophonist and singer, touring extensively and backing major blues artists. (Live performances with the Larkins band; the group did not record commercially.) [Mid-1930s through early 1940s tenure in the Larkins band.[1][2]]
- [[john_coltrane|John Coltrane]] - Tenor saxophonist who played in Vinson’s sextet early in his career and was exposed to Vinson’s expansive alto and blues-rooted phrasing. (Performances with Vinson’s post–big band small group; no widely cited commercial recordings as a unit.) [Mid-to-late 1940s during Vinson’s sextet period.[1][3]]
- [[t-bone_walker|T-Bone Walker]] - Electric blues guitarist and singer who shared bills with Vinson’s bands and later appeared with him in concert, representing a key peer in the jump-blues idiom. (Joint performances such as a 1969 rendition of “Just a Dream” with Jay McShann and Hal Singer.) [Initially late 1930s–1940s on territory band tours; later joint appearances in the 1960s.[1][2]]
- [[jay_mcshann|Jay McShann]] - Pianist and bandleader connected to Vinson since the early 1940s through the Kansas City scene and later European festival collaborations. (1974 concert in Nice, France, and performances of “Just a Dream” and other blues numbers.) [From early 1940s acquaintance to documented performances in the 1960s–1970s.[1][2]]
- [[cannonball_adderley|Cannonball Adderley]] - Alto saxophonist whose advocacy and collaboration in the early 1960s helped reintroduce Vinson to a wider jazz audience. (Projects and club dates that led to broader exposure, later documented on albums such as “Cleanhead & Cannonball.”) [Early 1960s onward, with recordings reissued in later decades.[1]]

### Artists Influenced
- [[john_coltrane|John Coltrane]] - Played in Vinson’s sextet and was influenced by Vinson’s expansive alto style and blues-rooted phrasing during his formative years. (Influence reflected broadly in Coltrane’s later saxophone approach rather than specific co-credited recordings.) [Mid-to-late 1940s apprenticeship period with Vinson.[1][3]]
