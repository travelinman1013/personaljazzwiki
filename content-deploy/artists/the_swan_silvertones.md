## Biography
The Swan Silvertones are a seminal American gospel group founded in 1938 by Claude Jeter, an Alabama native who moved to Coalwood, West Virginia, to work in the coal mines. Originally known as the Four Harmony Kings, the group began as a quartet of miners seeking solace and expression through music. After relocating to Knoxville, Tennessee, they gained local fame through a radio show sponsored by Swan Bakery, prompting their renaming to the Swan Silvertones. Their early sound was rooted in a cappella jubilee traditions, but they soon became innovators by integrating instruments and developing a sophisticated, polished vocal blend.

Throughout the 1940s and 1950s, the Swan Silvertones built a reputation for their tight harmonies, dynamic arrangements, and the soaring falsetto of lead singer Claude Jeter. They recorded extensively for King Records, Specialty Records, and later Vee-Jay Records, producing influential tracks such as 'Oh Mary Don't You Weep' and 'Saviour Pass Me Not.' The group’s style evolved from traditional jubilee to a more contemporary 'hard gospel' sound, marked by emotional intensity and technical virtuosity. Despite frequent personnel changes and the hardships of touring, the group maintained a high standard of artistry and spiritual commitment, with Jeter famously refusing offers to sing secular music in order to honor his promise to his mother.

The Swan Silvertones’ legacy is profound: they are widely regarded as one of the greatest gospel quartets of the twentieth century, influencing generations of artists across gospel, soul, and pop music. Their innovative approach to harmony and vocal technique set new standards for gospel performance, and their recordings continue to inspire listeners and musicians alike.
