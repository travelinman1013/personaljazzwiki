## Biography
David Paquette is an American jazz pianist born in Bridgeport, Connecticut in 1950. Raised in a musically vibrant household, Paquette was exposed early to the sounds of New Orleans jazz through his parents, who were active in the New Orleans revival scene. His formative years were marked by jam sessions with legendary musicians such as Kid Sheik, Louis Nelson, Sammy Penn, and Billie and Dede Pierce, which inspired him to teach himself piano using the family’s player piano[2][6][8].

Paquette’s career began to flourish during his university years at Louisiana State University, where he honed his entertainment and vocal skills in local piano bars. He later moved west, landing a regular gig at San Francisco’s Boarding House, opening for artists like Bette Midler, the Pointer Sisters, Dr. John, and comedian Steve Martin[2][6]. A decade-long residency at Maui’s Pioneer Inn followed, where he collaborated with Bonnie Raitt, Maria Muldaur, Kenny Loggins, and Fleetwood Mac’s John McVie, who produced his first album[2][6]. Paquette’s global career includes extensive touring across Europe, Australia, and the South Pacific, performances at major jazz festivals, and a significant role in New Zealand’s jazz scene, where he founded and directed the Waiheke Island Jazz Festival for over 16 years[2][3][5].

Known for his traditional New Orleans jazz style, Paquette has recorded more than 45 albums and served as musical director for prestigious venues such as Sydney’s Four Seasons Hotel. He continues to support young musicians through the Paquette Jazz Foundation, which provides scholarships and mentoring programs. Paquette’s legacy is marked by his dedication to jazz education, international collaborations, and his role in nurturing the genre’s future in the South Pacific[3][5].
