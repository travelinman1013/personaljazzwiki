## Biography
James "Son" Thomas (October 14, 1926 – June 26, 1993) was a renowned American Delta blues musician and self-taught sculptor whose life and artistry were deeply rooted in the cultural traditions of the Mississippi Delta. Born on a farm near Eden, Mississippi, Thomas grew up listening to blues on the radio and learned guitar by watching and imitating his uncle and grandfather. As a teenager, he moved to Leland, where he began performing in local juke joints and barrelhouses, developing a distinctive bottleneck blues style characterized by raw emotion and storytelling rooted in his experiences of poverty and hardship.[1][2][3][4][5]

Thomas's career gained wider recognition in the 1970s when he began performing at colleges and universities and at international festivals, including the Smithsonian Festival of American Folklife and events in Norway and Germany. His music was documented by folklorist William Ferris, and he recorded albums in the United States and Europe. Alongside his musical pursuits, Thomas was also celebrated for his clay sculptures, particularly skulls and caskets inspired by his work as a gravedigger and his fascination with themes of death and the supernatural. His sculptures were featured in major exhibitions, such as the "Black Folk Art in America, 1930–1980" at the Corcoran Gallery in Washington, D.C.[2][3][4]

Despite health setbacks later in life, including a brain tumor and emphysema, Thomas continued to perform into the early 1990s. He died in Greenville, Mississippi, in 1993, leaving a legacy as one of the great Delta bluesmen whose music and art captured the spirit and struggles of the region. His son, Pat Thomas, continues to perform his father's songs, ensuring the continuation of Son Thomas's influence on blues and folk art.[1][2]
