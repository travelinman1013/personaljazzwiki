## Biography
Charles Stepney (March 26, 1931 – May 17, 1976) was a visionary arranger, producer, composer, and multi-instrumentalist born and raised in Chicago. Coming from a musically inclined family, Stepney studied music theory at Wilson Junior College and began his career as a jazz vibraphonist in the vibrant Chicago club scene of the 1950s. Despite early struggles and nearly leaving music, a pivotal call from Chess Records led him to become a session player and, eventually, a leading arranger and producer for the label.

Stepney's creative direction at Chess Records was transformative, as he helped shape the sound of artists across jazz, soul, blues, and R&B. He co-founded Rotary Connection in 1966, a groundbreaking interracial psychedelic soul band, and produced all six of their albums, pioneering lush orchestral arrangements and genre fusion. His signature style—marked by intricate string and horn arrangements, classical influences, and experimental use of electronics—became foundational in the work of Minnie Riperton, The Dells, Marlena Shaw, Muddy Waters, Howlin’ Wolf, Earth, Wind & Fire, and many others. Stepney’s innovative approach bridged classical and popular music, anticipating the progressive rock and soul movements of the 1970s.

Though he died young at 45, Stepney’s legacy endures through the enduring influence of his arrangements and productions, which have been widely sampled in hip-hop and R&B. His posthumous recognition has grown, with his home-recorded demos released decades later, revealing the breadth of his genius and the lasting impact he had on generations of musicians.
