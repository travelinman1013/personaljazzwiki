## Biography
Mizz Lowe, born Loretta Harris in Holmes County, Mississippi in 1972, grew up immersed in the vibrant sounds of blues and soul that filled her father's café on the Egypt Plantation. Her early years in Greenwood, Mississippi were marked by active participation in church and school music programs, where she sang, played flute in the band, danced, and served as a majorette. From a young age, she was captivated by the music of legends such as B.B. King, Denise LaSalle, Little Milton, Tyrone Davis, Johnnie Taylor, and Bobby Rush—a roster she would later join professionally.

After a period of personal transition, Mizz Lowe found stability and purpose in music, joining Bobby Rush's Revue in the early 2000s as lead dancer and personal assistant. Her dynamic stage presence and fusion of jazz, blues, tap, and modern dance quickly made her a standout performer, earning her the role of 'Young Hen' alongside Rush, the King of the Chittlin’ Circuit. Her confidence as a recording artist grew through collaborations with Rush and keyboardist Paul Brown, leading to singles like 'Christmas Tears,' 'I Ain’t Givin’ Up My Love,' and 'Take My Love.'

Mizz Lowe's career has taken her around the world, performing in venues from Baghdad to Buckingham Palace, and sharing the stage with icons such as Patti LaBelle, Chaka Khan, Buddy Guy, Keb Mo, Ike Turner, and The Temptations. Her legacy is rooted in her ability to blend deep blues tradition with contemporary performance, serving as both a cultural ambassador and an inspiration to audiences and fellow musicians.
