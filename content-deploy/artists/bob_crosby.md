## Biography
Bob Crosby, born George Robert Crosby on August 23, 1913, in Spokane, Washington, was the younger brother of famed singer Bing Crosby. He attended Gonzaga College but dropped out to pursue music, starting his career as a vocalist with the Rhythm Boys, Anson Weeks' orchestra (1931-1934), and the Dorsey Brothers Orchestra (1934-1935), where he made his recording debut on 'I'm Getting Sentimental Over You.'[1][2][4] In 1935, Crosby was chosen to front a new band formed by former Ben Pollack musicians led by Gil Rodin, initially called the Clark Randall Orchestra; this evolved into the Bob Crosby Orchestra and its Dixieland subgroup, the Bob-Cats, blending traditional New Orleans jazz with swing for a unique sound during the swing era.[1][2][3][4]

The Bob Crosby Orchestra peaked in the late 1930s with hits like instrumental tracks 'Muskrat Ramble' and 'Dixieland Shuffle,' featuring standout soloists Yank Lawson (trumpet), Matty Matlock (clarinet), Eddie Miller (tenor sax), Bob Haggart (bass/arranger), Nappy Lamare (guitar/vocals), and Ray Bauduc (drums); Crosby, with his pleasant but unremarkable voice, often let the instrumentalists shine, achieving over 40 hit recordings including number ones like 'In a Little Gypsy Tea Room' (1935), 'Whispers in the Dark' (1937), and 'Day in Day Out' (1939), with 'Summertime' as their theme.[1][2][5] The band disbanded in 1942 due to World War II drafts; Crosby acted in films like 'Kansas City Kitty' (1944), served in the Marines leading a Pacific band, and later reformed short-lived groups in 1946 and 1952, recorded jazz albums like 'Bobcats In Hi Fi' and 'Live At The Rainbow Grill' (1966), and worked in radio/TV including on 'The Jack Benny Show.'[1][2]

Crosby's legacy endures through the Bob-Cats' revival of Dixieland amid swing's dominance, his respectful leadership that empowered musicians, and the band's continued performances posthumously; he composed 'Big Noise from Winnetka,' 'Until,' and 'Silver and Gold,' joining ASCAP in 1954, and passed away on March 9, 1993.[1][2][4]

## Fun Facts
- Despite being Bing Crosby's brother, Bob's biggest hits were instrumentals where he didn't sing, making him famous primarily as a bandleader rather than vocalist.[1]
- The band originated from disgruntled Ben Pollack musicians stranded in New York; they first offered the frontman role to Jack Teagarden, who declined, leading to Bob's selection.[2][3]
- Crosby was drafted into the Marines in 1944 and led a band entertaining troops in the Pacific theater during World War II.[1]
- His daughter Cathy Crosby appeared with him on TV and sang in films like 'The Beat Generation' (1959).[2]
