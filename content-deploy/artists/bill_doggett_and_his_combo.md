## Biography
William Ballard Doggett was born on February 16, 1916, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to a musically inclined family. Though he initially dreamed of playing trumpet, his family could not afford lessons, so his mother—a church pianist—encouraged him to pursue keyboards instead. He quickly mastered the instrument and was hailed as a child prodigy by age 13, forming his first band, the Five Majors, at just 15 years old. During the 1930s and early 1940s, Doggett worked as a pianist and arranger for bandleaders Lucky Millinder, Frank Fairfax, and arranger Jimmy Mundy, establishing himself as a skilled session musician. In 1942, he joined the Ink Spots as their pianist and arranger, contributing to several of their famous hits during the early 1940s.

Doggett's career reached its zenith during the 1950s when he transitioned from swing to rhythm and blues and soul jazz. In 1951, he made his debut as an organist during Ella Fitzgerald's recording sessions and became her primary collaborator as pianist, arranger, and music director. His greatest commercial success came in 1956 with "Honky Tonk," a rhythm and blues instrumental he co-wrote with Billy Butler that became a landmark recording—topping the R&B chart for over two months, reaching No. 2 on the pop chart, and eventually selling over four million copies. From 1952 to 1960, Doggett headed a small combo that recorded for King Records, establishing himself as a pioneer of the amplified, swinging dance music that would influence rock and roll. He continued performing and arranging for major artists including Louis Armstrong, Count Basie, and Lionel Hampton throughout his career.

Bill Doggett remained active in music until his death on November 13, 1996, at age 80 from cancer in New York City. His legacy as a master of the Hammond organ and a bridge between swing, rhythm and blues, and early rock and roll remains significant. Doggett was so identified with "Honky Tonk" that he famously stated he wouldn't be Bill Doggett if he didn't play it at every show, recognizing that it was what audiences came to hear. His innovative approach to the organ and his prolific arranging work influenced generations of musicians and helped define the sound of 1950s popular music.

## Fun Facts
- According to legend, Doggett reputedly traded his entire band outfit to Lucky Millinder for a soda when Millinder took over the band—though the veracity of this story is uncertain.
- "Honky Tonk" came about almost by accident during a Sunday night dance in Lima, Ohio. During a brief break in the normal set, an impromptu jam session occurred that had never been played before, and this spontaneous moment became his biggest hit.
- Doggett made his film debut as a pianist in the 1939 all-Black cast film "Paradise in Harlem" while playing with the Lucky Millinder Orchestra, and later appeared in Soundies (promotional music videos) with the orchestra.
- Early footage exists of Doggett performing a piano solo in the 1941 Soundie "Four Or Five Times" featuring Sister Rosetta Tharpe as band vocalist with the Lucky Millinder Orchestra, showcasing lindy hop dancing alongside the performance.
