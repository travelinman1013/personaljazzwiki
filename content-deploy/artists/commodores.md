## Biography
The Commodores, an American funk and soul group, formed in 1968 at Tuskegee Institute (now Tuskegee University) in Alabama from the merger of two student bands, the Mystics and the Jays. Original members included Lionel Richie (vocals, keyboards, saxophone), Thomas McClary (lead guitar, vocals), William King (trumpet), Milan Williams (keyboards), Ronald LaPread (bass, trumpet), and Walter 'Clyde' Orange (drums, vocals), with early changes like Andre Callahan and Michael Gilbert departing soon after. They gained initial fame opening for the Jackson 5, signing with Motown in 1972 after winning a college talent contest and performing locally at venues like the Black Forest Inn[1][2][3].

Their breakthrough came with the 1974 instrumental hit 'Machine Gun,' followed by funk anthems like 'Slippery When Wet' and ballads such as 'Three Times a Lady' (1978) and 'Still' (1979), blending Southern funk, Motown soul, and animated vocals from Richie and Orange. The late 1970s and early 1980s marked their peak, but Lionel Richie's departure in 1982 for a solo career shifted dynamics. Founding members like McClary (1984), LaPread (1986), and Williams (1989) exited, with replacements including Sheldon Reynolds and James Dean 'J.D.' Nicholas, who joined as co-lead vocalist in 1984[1][3][4].

The group achieved a Grammy for 'Nightshift' in 1985 on Polydor after leaving Motown, moving toward pop while retaining core members Orange, King, and Nicholas. They formed Commodores Records in 1990, releasing re-recorded hits, live albums, and new material, continuing to tour into the 21st century with a legacy of over 20 Top 10 hits and enduring funk-soul influence[3][4][6].

## Fun Facts
- The band's name was chosen randomly when William King flipped open a dictionary and pointed to 'Commodores'; they narrowly avoided 'Commodes'[1][3].
- Their first singer was James Ingram, unrelated to the famous solo artist, before Lionel Richie took over vocals[1][3].
- Keyboardist Milan Williams left in 1989 after refusing to tour South Africa[1][3].
- They won their first Grammy in 1986 for 'Nightshift' without Lionel Richie, after years of Motown hits[3][6].
