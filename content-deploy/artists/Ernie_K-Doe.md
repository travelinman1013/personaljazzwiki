## Biography
Ernie K-Doe, born Ernest Kador Jr. on February 22, 1936, in New Orleans, Louisiana, was a flamboyant and influential figure in the city’s rich R&B tradition. Raised in a religious household as the son of a Baptist preacher, K-Doe’s earliest musical experiences were rooted in gospel, and he was particularly inspired by the passionate singing style of Archie Brownlee of the Five Blind Boys of Mississippi. After winning a local talent contest while attending Booker T. Washington High School, he moved to Chicago for a period before returning to New Orleans to pursue a career in secular music.

K-Doe began recording in the mid-1950s, first with the Blue Diamonds and then as a solo artist. His breakthrough came in 1961 with the Allen Toussaint-penned 'Mother-in-Law,' which topped both the Billboard pop and R&B charts and became his signature song. He followed this success with a string of regional hits, including 'Te-Ta-Te-Ta-Ta,' 'A Certain Girl,' and 'Hello My Lover,' all characterized by Toussaint’s production and the infectious rhythms of New Orleans R&B. Despite his early chart success, K-Doe struggled to maintain national prominence, and by the 1970s, personal challenges—including alcoholism—led to a period of obscurity. However, he experienced a late-career resurgence as a charismatic radio personality and proprietor of the Mother-In-Law Lounge, cementing his status as a beloved local icon.

K-Doe’s flamboyant persona, self-aggrandizing humor, and enduring musical legacy made him a revered figure in New Orleans culture. He was inducted into the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame and received the Rhythm & Blues Foundation Pioneer Award. Until his death in 2001, K-Doe remained a celebrated ambassador of New Orleans R&B, influencing generations of musicians and delighting audiences with his larger-than-life presence.
