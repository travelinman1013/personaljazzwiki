## Biography
Marta Złakowska is a Polish vocalist from Płock, a small riverside town, who began her musical journey with classical and jazz vocal training, drawing inspiration from an eclectic mix of R&B, soul, minimal techno, and even metal[1]. Her career took a pivotal turn in 2017 when she met the influential English trip-hop artist Tricky (Adrian Nicholas Matthews Thaws) by chance in Poland, leading to her joining his band and touring Europe as a guest vocalist[1][3]. Over the next six years, Marta became a central figure in Tricky’s creative process, contributing to several of his projects and eventually co-creating music that blends her delicate, emotionally resonant voice with his signature dark, layered production[1][3]. Their collaboration culminated in the 2023 mini-album 'When It’s Going Wrong' and the announcement of Marta’s debut solo LP, 'Out The Way,' both produced by Tricky[1][3]. Marta’s style is marked by its warmth, authenticity, and a broad emotional spectrum, with critics noting her ability to counterbalance Tricky’s darker impulses with her feathery, coolly delicate vocals[1][3]. Though still early in her solo career, Marta has already earned critical acclaim for her role in shaping the sound of Tricky’s recent work, particularly on his 2020 album 'Fall to Pieces'[1][3].
