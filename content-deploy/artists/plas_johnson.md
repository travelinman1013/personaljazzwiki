## Biography
Plas John Johnson Jr., born July 21, 1931, in Donaldsonville, Louisiana, is an acclaimed American saxophonist best known for his iconic tenor sax solo on Henry Mancini’s 'The Pink Panther Theme.' Johnson’s musical journey began in his family’s group, where he sang before his father, a professional musician, introduced him to the soprano saxophone. Largely self-taught, he soon gravitated to the tenor sax, forming the Johnson Brothers Combo with his brother Ray in New Orleans during the late 1940s. Their early recordings laid the foundation for a career that would span jazz, R&B, and popular music.

After touring with R&B singer Charles Brown and serving in the Army, Johnson moved to Los Angeles in 1954, where he briefly studied at the Westlake School of Music before becoming a full-time session musician. His remarkable sight-reading skills and stylistic versatility made him a fixture in the studios, playing on countless recordings for Capitol Records and other labels. Johnson’s saxophone graced records by Peggy Lee, Nat 'King' Cole, Frank Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald, and The Beach Boys, among many others. He was celebrated for his ability to move seamlessly between jazz, rock and roll, and R&B, making him one of the most in-demand session musicians of the 1950s and 1960s.

Johnson’s musical style is characterized by a warm, expressive tone and a mastery of phrasing that blends jazz sophistication with soulful R&B inflections. His legacy is cemented not only by his solo work and his famous 'Pink Panther' performance but also by his contributions to the sound of American popular music, influencing generations of saxophonists and session players.
