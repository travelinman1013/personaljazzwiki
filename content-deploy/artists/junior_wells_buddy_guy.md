## Biography
Junior Wells, born Amos Blakemore in 1934 in Memphis, Tennessee, was a pioneering Chicago blues harmonica player and vocalist whose career spanned over five decades. He moved to Chicago in 1948 and quickly immersed himself in the city's vibrant blues scene, sitting in with local musicians and developing his amplified harmonica style under the influence of Little Walter. Wells made his first recordings in 1952 as a replacement for Little Walter in Muddy Waters's band, and by the 1960s, he had become a fixture on the Chicago blues circuit, known for his dynamic stage presence and soulful vocals. His 1965 album 'Hoodoo Man Blues,' recorded with guitarist Buddy Guy, is considered a landmark in electric Chicago blues and helped define the genre for future generations.

Buddy Guy, born George Guy in 1936 in Lettsworth, Louisiana, is one of the most influential Chicago blues guitarists of all time. He moved to Chicago in the late 1950s and quickly became a sought-after session guitarist at Chess Records, playing with legends like Muddy Waters. Guy's partnership with Junior Wells began in 1965, resulting in several acclaimed recordings and live performances. Known for his raw, expressive guitar playing and flamboyant stage presence, Guy influenced countless rock and blues guitarists, including Eric Clapton, Jimi Hendrix, and Stevie Ray Vaughan. Both artists played pivotal roles in shaping the sound of modern blues, with Guy's career enjoying a resurgence in the 1990s and Wells remaining a respected figure until his death in 1998.
