## Biography
Charlotte Day Wilson is a Toronto-born singer, songwriter, producer, and multi-instrumentalist whose emotionally resonant blend of alternative R&B, soul, and jazz has made her a standout figure in contemporary music. Raised in a musically supportive family, Wilson began classical piano lessons at a young age, later teaching herself music production with GarageBand as a teenager. She briefly studied music, philosophy, and women's studies at the University of King's College in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where she also honed her performance skills as part of the cover band The Wayo, playing over 100 shows in a year. Returning to Toronto, she interned at the influential Arts & Crafts label, which helped her establish vital industry connections and solidify her path as an independent artist.[1][2][3]

Wilson's career is marked by her fiercely independent approach—she often writes, produces, and engineers her own music. Her 2016 EP 'CDW' garnered significant attention, especially with the track 'Work,' which became an unofficial anthem for the 2017 Women's March and was featured in an Apple commercial, allowing her to pursue music full-time. Her subsequent releases, including the acclaimed 'Stone Woman' EP and her debut album 'Alpha' (2021), showcase her introspective songwriting and lush, soulful arrangements. Wilson's music often explores themes of vulnerability, identity, and queer experience, resonating with a wide audience and earning her critical recognition, including a Grammy nomination for her recent work.[1][2][3][5]

Known for her collaborative spirit, Wilson has worked with a range of Toronto's progressive musicians, such as Daniel Caesar, River Tiber, and BADBADNOTGOOD, while also drawing inspiration from classic soul icons like Aretha Franklin and Motown. Her artistry is defined by a commitment to authenticity and emotional honesty, positioning her as a leading voice in alternative R&B and a role model for independent musicians.[1][4][5]
