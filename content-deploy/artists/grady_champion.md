## Biography
Grady Champion is a modern Mississippi blues singer, harmonica player, guitarist, songwriter, and producer, known for blending down‑home Delta tradition with soul, gospel, and hints of hip‑hop. Born October 10, 1969, he grew up on a farm in Canton, Mississippi, in a large, religious family as the youngest of his father’s 28 children, discovering his voice in the church choir at age eight.[1][3] As a teenager he moved with his family to Miami, Florida, briefly attending high school there before returning to Mississippi to graduate; at 18 he went back to Florida and entered the music business behind the scenes as a promoter for the rap label Sun Town Records, soon launching a short career as rapper MC Gold before realizing his natural affinity for the blues.[1]

In his early 20s Champion deepened his understanding of the business side of music while working about five years for FJH Music under Frank J. Hackinson, former president of Columbia Pictures, an experience he later credited with teaching him how to build a sustainable career.[1] After taking up harmonica in the mid‑1990s, he self‑released his debut blues album "Goin’ Back Home" in 1998 and was quickly signed by Shanachie Records, which issued "Payin’ for My Sins" (1999) and "2 Days Short of a Week" (2001), records that announced him as a rising contemporary blues voice.[1][2] His songwriting gained national recognition when "Trust Yourself," co‑written with Kevin Bowe, appeared on Etta James’s Grammy‑winning album "Let’s Roll" (Best Contemporary Blues Album) and on her Blues Music Award–winning Soul/Blues Album of the Year in 2003–2004.[1] Champion continued releasing albums on his own GSM/Grady Shady imprints—including "Back in Mississippi: Live at the 930 Blues Café" (2008), "Dreamin’" (2011), and "Tough Times Don’t Last" (2013)—and in 2010 he won the International Blues Challenge, expanding his touring across the U.S., Canada, and Europe and securing slots at major events such as the Chicago Blues Festival, Legendary Blues Cruise, and Portland Waterfront Blues Festival.[1][4]

By the mid‑2010s Champion had become one of the key figures carrying forward authentic Mississippi and soul‑blues. In 2013 he signed with Jackson‑based Malaco Records and released "Bootleg Whiskey" (2014), followed by "One of a Kind" in 2016, his tenth album overall and a statement of his distinctive mix of gritty storytelling, socially conscious lyrics, and crowd‑pleasing showmanship.[1][4][6] Critics and fans have compared his harmonica style and vocal delivery to classic artists like Sonny Boy Williamson, yet he stands out for folding hip‑hop cadences and modern R&B grooves into a traditional framework.[1][3][5] Performing roughly 180 shows a year at one point, Champion built a reputation as a dynamic entertainer whose cross‑over appeal links predominantly white traditional‑blues audiences and predominantly Black soul‑blues fans, helping to keep Mississippi blues vibrant for a new generation.[1][4][6]
