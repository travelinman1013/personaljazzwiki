## Biography
The Brubeck Brothers Quartet is a jazz ensemble formed by brothers Chris Brubeck (bass, trombone, composer) and Dan Brubeck (drums), sons of legendary jazz pianist Dave Brubeck. Born into a musical family—Chris and Dan began playing together as children, cutting their first record in 1966—and grew up immersed in jazz through their father's influence. They started performing and recording with Dave in the 1970s, joining groups like Two Generations of Brubeck and the New Brubeck Quartet alongside brother Darius. The Quartet solidified with guitarist Mike DeMicco and pianist Chuck Lamb, blending straight-ahead jazz with fusion elements, complex rhythms, and arrangements of Dave Brubeck's compositions.[1][2][4][5]

The group's career spans decades of international touring at major festivals including Newport, Monterey, Detroit, Montreal, and Playboy/Hollywood Bowl, as well as collaborations with orchestras like the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra, Philadelphia Orchestra, Russian National Symphony, and Singapore Chinese Orchestra. Albums like *TimeLine* (2018), celebrating Dave's 1958 State Department tour, and *LifeTimes* topped Jazz Week radio charts. Chris has composed symphonic works and led side projects like Triple Play and The Dolphins, while Dan brought polyrhythmic expertise honed under mentors. Their style honors their father's cool jazz legacy while incorporating modern versatility across jazz subgenres.[1][2][4][5]

The Quartet's legacy perpetuates Dave Brubeck's influence, especially highlighted in 2020 centennial celebrations featuring multimedia shows of his life. They continue active performances, maintaining a dynamic presence in jazz through original compositions, reimaginings of classics, and educational outreach, bridging family tradition with contemporary appeal.[1][3][5]
