## Biography
Hugh Ramapolo Masekela was born on April 4, 1939, in Witbank, South Africa, and emerged as one of the country's most influential jazz musicians and anti-apartheid activists. From a young age, Masekela displayed a deep affinity for music, inspired by American jazz legends such as Louis Armstrong and Dizzy Gillespie, as well as traditional South African sounds. At 14, he received his first trumpet from Father Trevor Huddleston, a prominent advocate for equal rights, which set him on the path to becoming a pioneering figure in South African jazz. He co-founded the Jazz Epistles, the first African jazz group to record an LP, and quickly gained recognition for his skill and innovative style.

Masekela's career spanned continents and genres, blending American jazz with South African mbaqanga, funk, and pop. Forced into exile due to apartheid, he lived and performed in the United States, Europe, and Africa, recording over forty albums and collaborating with artists such as Miriam Makeba, Paul Simon, and Ladysmith Black Mambazo. His music became a powerful voice against apartheid, with songs like 'Soweto Blues' and 'Bring Him Back Home' serving as anthems for the movement. Masekela returned to South Africa in 1991 and continued to tour and record, leaving a legacy as a musical innovator and a defiant political voice.
