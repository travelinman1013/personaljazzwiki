## Biography
The Ronettes were an American girl group formed in 1959 in New York City's Spanish Harlem (also noted as Washington Heights) by sisters Veronica 'Ronnie' Bennett (later Ronnie Spector, 1943-2022), Estelle Bennett, and their cousin Nedra Talley. From a young age, the trio harmonized under the encouragement of their grandmother, performing as the Darling Sisters and winning talent contests at the Apollo Theater. They gained early exposure dancing at the Peppermint Lounge in 1961 during the Twist craze, which led to a recording deal with Colpix Records under names like Ronnie and the Relatives, though initial singles such as 'I Want a Boy' failed to chart.[1][2][3][4][5]

Their career skyrocketed in 1963 upon signing with producer Phil Spector at Philles Records, who crafted their signature beehive hairstyles, glamorous image, and 'Wall of Sound' production style blending sweet, sultry vocals with dense orchestration. Hits like 'Be My Baby' (No. 2 US), 'Baby I Love You,' 'Walking in the Rain,' and 'Do I Love You?' defined the girl-group era, showcasing Ronnie's distinctive seductive delivery. They toured England with the Rolling Stones in 1964, meeting the Beatles, and opened for the Beatles' 1965 US tour, though Spector's controlling nature limited their output.[1][2][3][4]

The group disbanded by 1967 amid shifting tastes and internal issues, including Ronnie's 1968 marriage to Spector, which ended tumultuously in 1974. Ronnie pursued solo work, including a 1986 hit 'Take Me Home Tonight' with Eddie Money, and later revivals, while the original lineup was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2007. Their Spector-era sound and youthful sensuality left a lasting legacy in pop music.[1][2][3]

## Fun Facts
- The Ronettes accidentally launched their career at the Peppermint Lounge in 1961 when the manager mistook them for a no-show act and pushed them onstage to perform Ray Charles' 'What I Say,' leading to a steady dancing gig.[1][3]
- Phil Spector initially wanted to sign only Ronnie solo, but her mother insisted on the full trio, securing the group's Philles deal.[5]
- Their 1963 Christmas album 'A Christmas Gift for You' was recorded just before President Kennedy's assassination, which halted its promotion despite becoming a holiday classic.[3][7]
- Ronnie Spector later narrated her life in the 1990 autobiography 'Be My Baby: How I Survived Mascara, Miniskirts and Madness.'[5]
