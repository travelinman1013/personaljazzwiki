## Biography
David 'Junior' Kimbrough was born on July 28, 1930, in Hudsonville, Mississippi, and spent his life in the North Mississippi Hill Country near Holly Springs[1][3][6]. Raised in a musical family, Kimbrough learned guitar from his father at age eight and was surrounded by local blues musicians, including Fred McDowell, Eli Green, Johnny Woods, and Gus Cannon[4]. As a teenager, he sang in a gospel group and by the late 1950s had formed the Soul Blues Boys, an electric blues band that set him apart from the more traditional solo and duo acts in his region[4].

Kimbrough developed a hypnotic, modal style marked by droning bass rhythms and syncopated melodies, often described as 'cotton patch blues' or 'cotton patch soul blues'[1][2]. His music drew from influences like Lightnin’ Hopkins, Mississippi Fred McDowell, and Eli Green, but was uniquely his own, characterized by polyrhythms and a trance-like groove that critics linked to African musical traditions[1][3]. Despite decades of performing in juke joints and house parties, Kimbrough only gained national attention in the 1990s with his Fat Possum Records debut 'All Night Long' (1992), produced by Robert Palmer and featuring his son Kent 'Kinney' Kimbrough and Garry Burnside[1]. Subsequent albums, including 'Sad Days, Lonely Nights' (1994) and 'Most Things Haven’t Worked Out' (1997), solidified his reputation as a blues innovator.

Kimbrough's legacy is profound: he operated his own juke joint, Junior’s Place, which became a pilgrimage site for blues fans and musicians[2]. His influence extended to alternative rock and modern blues artists, inspiring tributes from The Black Keys, Iggy & The Stooges, and Mark Lanegan[1]. After his death in 1998, his music continued to shape the North Mississippi blues tradition through his children and protégés, and his hypnotic style remains a touchstone for contemporary blues musicians[1][2][5].
