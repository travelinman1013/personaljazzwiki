## Biography
Sonny Terry (born Saunders Terrell, October 24, 1911, Greensboro, Georgia) and Brownie McGhee (born November 30, 1915, Knoxville, Tennessee) formed one of the most celebrated blues duos of the 20th century. Terry, blinded in childhood accidents, was taught harmonica by his father and developed a dynamic style that mimicked train whistles and animal sounds, often blending vocalizations with his playing. After his father's death, Terry began performing with Piedmont blues guitarist Blind Boy Fuller, making his recording debut in the late 1930s. McGhee, a skilled guitarist and singer, met Terry in 1939, and their partnership began in earnest after Fuller's death in 1941.[2][4][5]

Together, Terry and McGhee became fixtures of the American blues and folk scene, recording prolifically for labels such as Savoy, Folkways, Prestige, and Fantasy. Their music bridged rural and urban blues traditions, and they were instrumental in the folk revival of the 1950s and 1960s, collaborating with artists like Woody Guthrie, Pete Seeger, and Leadbelly. Their repertoire included blues, folk songs, and ballads, which helped introduce blues music to broader audiences, including international tours and festival appearances.[1][3][7]

The duo's partnership, which lasted over 35 years, was marked by both artistic synergy and personal tension, leading to their split in the 1970s. Terry continued performing solo and with other musicians until his death in 1986. Their legacy endures through their influential recordings, stage appearances (including Broadway shows like "Finian's Rainbow" and "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"), and their impact on generations of blues and folk musicians.[2][4][5]
