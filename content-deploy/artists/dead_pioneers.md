## Biography
Dead Pioneers is a punk rock band from Denver, Colorado, founded by Gregg Deal, a nationally recognized Indigenous artist of the Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe.[1] The band emerged in 2021 as an outgrowth of Deal's 2020 performance art piece titled "The Punk Pan-Indian Romantic Comedy," a deeply personal one-man show exploring themes of identity, music, and cultural resistance.[1][3] What began as an attempt to integrate punk riffs with spoken word for this performance piece evolved into a full musical project when Deal met Lee Tesche, lead guitarist for the punk band Algiers, at an artist residency at the Atlantic Center for the Arts in Florida in early 2021.[1][2] Together with local Denver musicians guitarist Josh Rivera and drummer Shane Zweygardt, Deal recorded a six-minute version of "Bad Indian," which sparked the realization that they had something special musically.[2]

Dead Pioneers solidified as a five-piece band after adding veteran punk guitarist Abe Brennan to the lineup.[1][2] The band recorded their self-titled debut album in just two days at The Blasting Room, the Fort Collins studio founded by Bill Stevenson of Descendents, in 2023.[1][2] The 22-minute debut album showcased their distinctive fusion of raw spoken word, raucous power chords, and heavy beats, drawing comparisons to punk pioneers like Minutemen and Rollins Band.[2][7] The album's powerful opening track "Tired" serves as a scathing indictment of Native American oppression, while "We Were Punk First"—a title originating from Native artist Walt Pourier—became an anthem for the band's mission.[2] After its initial self-release, the album caught the attention of industry veterans including Jello Biafra, former Dead Kennedys frontman, who traveled to Denver to see the band perform in January 2024.[2] The band later signed to Hassle Records, which re-released their debut LP.[3]

Dead Pioneers represents a powerful intersection of punk aesthetics, Indigenous activism, and artistic expression, standing in solidarity with Indigenous rights, Black rights, Brown rights, Asian rights, LGBTQ+ rights, and workers' rights.[1] Their music harnesses the raw energy of punk and alternative influences to challenge prevailing narratives about Indigenous experience and American political life, creating a visceral platform for addressing systemic marginalization and colonization.[6] The band's success has expanded beyond the Denver scene, with notable achievements including opening for Pearl Jam on tour—a connection facilitated when bassist Jeff Ament, who had previously purchased work from Gregg Deal, recruited them for the opportunity.[4] Dead Pioneers continues to assert that art in all its forms can be a powerful vehicle for activism and change.[6]

## Fun Facts
- Gregg Deal 'accidentally started a band'—he initially intended only to integrate punk riffs with spoken word for his performance art piece, but the collaboration evolved into a full musical project.[2]
- The band recorded their entire 22-minute debut album in just two days at The Blasting Room, the legendary Fort Collins studio founded by Bill Stevenson of Descendents.[2]
- Gregg Deal didn't form his first band until his 40s, despite a two-decade career as a visual artist; he estimates he moved no fewer than 25 times in seven years before getting married, carrying that lack of permanence into his adult life.[4]
- The band's song title 'We Were Punk First' originates from Native artist Walt Pourier, whose organization the Stronghold Society brings skateboarding to tribal communities to help kids avoid self-harm.[2]
- Dead Pioneers were recruited to open for Pearl Jam on tour because bassist Jeff Ament had previously purchased artwork from Gregg Deal and they became acquaintances; Ament later recruited them to headline the Big Sandy Pig Roast charity punk fest in Montana, whose high school mascot is ironically the Pioneers.[4]
