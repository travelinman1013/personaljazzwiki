## Biography
Mel Tormé, born Melvin Howard Tormé on September 13, 1925, in Chicago, Illinois, was a prodigious American musician, singer, composer, arranger, drummer, actor, and author. The son of Russian-Jewish immigrants, Tormé began singing professionally at age four and was performing in vaudeville and on radio by age six. By fifteen, he had published his first song, 'Lament to Love,' which became a hit for Harry James, and soon after, he was playing drums and singing with Chico Marx’s band. In 1943, Tormé formed the Mel-Tones, a pioneering vocal jazz group, and made his film debut in 'Higher and Higher' alongside Frank Sinatra.

Tormé’s solo career blossomed in the late 1940s with hits like 'Blue Moon' and the release of 'California Suite,' Capitol Records’ first long-playing album. He became known as 'The Velvet Fog' for his smooth, rich vocal timbre, though he personally disliked the nickname. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, Tormé transitioned from crooning to jazz, working with top arrangers like Marty Paich and earning acclaim for his improvisational skill and scat singing. He co-wrote the enduring holiday classic 'The Christmas Song' with Bob Wells, which became a standard after Nat King Cole’s 1946 recording. Tormé continued to record, perform, and act into the 1990s, earning two Grammy Awards and cementing his legacy as one of jazz’s most versatile and influential vocalists.

Tormé’s impact extended beyond performance; he authored several books, including his autobiography and a biography of Buddy Rich. His career, which spanned over six decades, was marked by a relentless pursuit of musical excellence and innovation, influencing generations of jazz and pop vocalists. He passed away on June 5, 1999, in Los Angeles, California, leaving behind a rich catalog of recordings and compositions that continue to inspire.
