## Biography
Charles Brimmer, born October 10, 1948, in New Orleans’ Ninth Ward, emerged as a significant figure in the city’s soul and R&B scene from the mid-1960s through the early 1980s. His musical journey began in gospel choirs as a child, but by high school, he was already venturing into secular music, joining the local group The Ravens and replacing Carl Weathers, who would later become famous as an actor. Brimmer’s early solo recordings were produced by Wardell Quezergue and released on the ABS label, followed by a series of singles on Dave Bartholomew’s Broadmoor imprint, including the well-received 'The Feeling Is In My Heart.'[1][3][4][5]

After high school, Brimmer joined David Batiste and the Gladiators, gaining a reputation as a versatile and dynamic live performer who could interpret the latest soul and R&B hits with authenticity and flair. Despite setbacks with record labels and unfulfilled album promises, Brimmer’s persistence led to regional hits and eventually to his best-known work in the 1970s, including the album 'Expressions of Soul' and the hit single 'God Bless Our Love.' His style, rooted in deep Southern soul, combined gospel-influenced vocals with the rhythmic sensibilities of New Orleans R&B, earning him a loyal local following and recognition among Northern Soul enthusiasts internationally. Though his national profile was limited by industry challenges and the rise of disco, Brimmer’s recordings remain prized by collectors and soul aficionados.[1][2][4][8]
