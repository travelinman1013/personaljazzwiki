## Biography
The Pine Leaf Boys are a renowned Cajun and Creole band originating from Lafayette, Louisiana, founded in 2004 by Wilson Savoy, whose deep musical roots trace back to his family—his father Marc Savoy is a legendary Cajun accordionist and craftsman, and his mother Ann Savoy is a respected singer and guitarist[1][2][3]. The band quickly gained recognition for their energetic performances and dedication to reviving traditional Cajun and Creole music, blending influences from historic artists like Amédé Ardoin and modern acts such as the Mamou Playboys and Wayne Toups[1][3]. Their sound is characterized by fiddle-and-accordion-driven arrangements, high-spirited rhythms, and a commitment to both preserving and evolving the Cajun musical legacy[3][4].

The Pine Leaf Boys began as street performers at the University of Louisiana in Lafayette, soon transitioning to local bars and dance halls after a public dispute over their campus performances[2]. Their rapid ascent led to international tours, including cultural ambassador trips sponsored by the U.S. State Department to Europe, the Middle East, and Asia[1][2][3]. Over the years, they have released multiple albums, received four Grammy nominations, and played a pivotal role in the Cajun music renaissance, inspiring new generations while honoring the genre's rich history[1][3][4].

The band's lineup includes Wilson Savoy (accordion, piano, vocals), Chris Segura (fiddle, vocals), Drew Simon (drums, vocals), Jean Bertrand (guitar), and Thomas David (bass)[1]. Former members include Courtney Granger and Cedric Watson, both influential musicians in their own right. The Pine Leaf Boys are celebrated for their ability to unearth forgotten Cajun classics, infuse them with modern energy, and maintain the vibrant spirit of Louisiana's musical traditions[3][4].

- The band was once banned from playing on their university campus for 'disturbing the peace,' which led to a surge in local support and their rapid rise[2].
- The Pine Leaf Boys have performed in over 20 countries and 47 U.S. states as cultural ambassadors for the U.S. State Department[2].
- Members Wilson Savoy, Courtney Granger, and Cedric Watson appeared in the HBO series Treme, highlighting their influence on New Orleans music culture[1].
