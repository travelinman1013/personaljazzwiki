# Bob French

## Biography
Bob French (December 27, 1937 – November 12, 2012) was a New Orleans jazz drummer, bandleader, and WWOZ radio host from a third-generation musical family. Born in New Orleans, Louisiana, he was the son of banjo player Albert 'Papa' French and grandson of a tuba player, with an uncle who played trombone. Initially uninterested in traditional jazz, young Bob preferred R&B and at age 15 played in a band with Art Neville, Charles Neville, and James Booker. His career shifted after joining his father's band at the Fairmont Hotel, where seasoned musicians like Jack Willis, Frog Joseph, Joseph 'Cornbread' Thomas, Jeanette Kimball, and Frank Fields guided him, building his skills in New Orleans jazz.[1][2][3][4]

From 1977, following his father's death, French led the Original Tuxedo Jazz Band, New Orleans' oldest continuously performing jazz ensemble founded in 1910 by Oscar 'Papa' Celestin. Under his direction until 2011 due to health issues, the band preserved traditional jazz, performing standards at venues like Irvin Mayfield’s Jazz Playhouse. French's forceful personality shone as a controversial WWOZ DJ on shows like 'New Orleans Music' and 'French Cooking,' known for repetitive playlists, post-Katrina rants, and candid style that boosted fundraisers despite conflicts leading to his dismissal. He recorded extensively with artists like Fats Domino and released *Marsalis Music Honors Bob French* in 2007, featuring Branford Marsalis, Harry Connick Jr., and Trombone Shorty.[1][2][5]

French's legacy centers on mentoring young musicians to preserve New Orleans jazz culture amid modern jazz trends. He taught players like Glen Andrews, Shamarr Allen, and Kid Chocolate the traditional style, ensuring its continuity. His nephew Gerald French succeeded him as bandleader, honoring his life with performances post-death. History remembers French more for his musical preservation than radio antics.[1][2]
