## Biography
Jason Marsalis (born March 4, 1977) is an American jazz drummer, vibraphone player, composer, producer, and band leader who represents the youngest generation of the illustrious Marsalis family of New Orleans musicians.[1] Growing up in a music-first household led by his father Ellis Marsalis Jr., a legendary pianist and educator, Jason was introduced to music at age three when his parents gave him a toy drum set. By age six, he began formal drum lessons with James Black, one of New Orleans' most respected drummers, and by age seven was already performing occasionally in his father's band.[1][3] His early musical education was shaped by the vibrant New Orleans jazz scene and formal training at the New Orleans Center for Creative Arts (NOCCA) and Loyola University New Orleans, where he studied percussion.

Jason's professional career took flight in the mid-1990s when he joined pianist Marcus Roberts' trio at age 17, touring extensively and performing selections from Roberts' acclaimed "Gershwin for Lovers" album.[1] At age 21, he released his debut album as leader, "The Year of the Drummer," establishing himself as a formidable force in contemporary jazz. Throughout the late 1990s and 2000s, he worked as a sideman in diverse musical contexts—from mainstream jazz and funk fusion (including work with Snarky Puppy) to Brazilian percussion ensembles and Celtic music.[1] A pivotal moment came in 2008 when he performed with the Lionel Hampton Orchestra, after which he increasingly focused on the vibraphone as his principal instrument, though he remains a sought-after drummer.[3] In 2009, he released his first vibraphone album as leader, "Music Update," which received critical acclaim, and followed with "In a World of Mallets" in 2013, which topped JazzWeek's chart.[1] His contributions to jazz have been recognized with his designation as an NEA Jazz Master alongside his father and brothers.

Marsalis is known for his sophisticated compositional approach, often employing complex time signatures, polyrhythmic structures, and intricate textures that reflect both scientific precision and playful creativity.[2] His playing style is characterized by dynamic control, chamber ensemble precision, and bluesy authority combined with improvisational firepower. Beyond performance, Marsalis is a passionate educator who advocates for maintaining music programs in public schools and has taught at NOCCA while continuing to perform at prestigious venues including the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival.[3][7]

## Fun Facts
- At age three, Jason's parents would announce him while he played his toy drum set, saying 'Ladies and gentlemen, introducing the fabulous Jason'—a playful prediction of his future stardom.[3]
- Jason initially studied violin and played in youth orchestras while living in Richmond, Virginia for three years, but switched to percussion upon returning to New Orleans in 1989, ultimately choosing not to follow the same instruments as his famous siblings (Wynton on trumpet, Branford on saxophone, Delfeayo on trombone).[5]
- His 2013 vibraphone album 'In a World of Mallets' peaked at #1 on JazzWeek's chart, and each band member (Austin Johnson on piano, Will Goble on bass, and Dave Potter on drums) contributed one original composition to the record.[1]
- Marsalis plays multiple percussion instruments including marimba, glockenspiel, tubular bells, vibraphone, and xylophone, demonstrating versatility that extends beyond his primary instruments of drums and vibraphone.[1]
