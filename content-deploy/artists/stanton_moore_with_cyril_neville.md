## Biography
Stanton Moore is a Grammy award-winning drummer born July 9, 1972, in New Orleans, Louisiana, who has become one of the premier funk and jazz musicians of his generation. Over his 25-year career, Moore established himself as a founding member of the influential funk band Galactic in the early 1990s, while simultaneously pursuing a prolific solo recording career that began with his 1998 debut album All Kooked Out!. His musical foundation is deeply rooted in New Orleans' rich musical heritage, drawing inspiration from pioneering funk drummers like Jabo Starks, Clyde Stubblefield, and Zigaboo Modeliste, as well as jazz legends such as Philly Joe Jones. Moore's collaboration with soul singer Cyril Neville represents a significant artistic partnership, particularly evident in their work together on the Allen Toussaint tribute album With You In Mind, where Neville's powerful vocals complemented Moore's sophisticated drumming across multiple tracks.

Moore's artistic approach is characterized by his ability to seamlessly blend funk, jazz, and second-line New Orleans traditions. He has pursued formal musical education throughout his career, taking lessons with veteran drummer Kenny Washington and studying with Clayton-Hamilton Jazz Orchestra co-leader Jeff Hamilton. His commitment to mastering both funk and jazz drumming led him to create the multimedia project Groove Alchemy in 2010, which explored funk drumming through instructional materials, and later the album Conversations, a jazz piano trio recording that showcased his profound swing and jazz vocabulary. Beyond performance, Moore has become an influential educator, establishing the Stanton Moore Drum Academy in 2017 and regularly writing for drumming magazines while traveling internationally to teach New Orleans drumming techniques.

Throughout his career, Moore has collaborated with an exceptionally diverse array of artists spanning multiple genres, including Maceo Parker, Joss Stone, Irma Thomas, Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine, Corrosion of Conformity, Trombone Shorty, and the Preservation Hall Jazz Band. His work with Cyril Neville on the Allen Toussaint tribute project exemplifies his deep connection to New Orleans musical culture and his ability to honor the city's legendary artists while creating contemporary music that resonates with both jazz and funk audiences.

## Fun Facts
- Moore conducted what he describes as 'basically a doctoral program' on funk drumming, studying pioneering drummers Jabo Starks, Clyde Stubblefield, and Zigaboo Modeliste for his 2010 multimedia project Groove Alchemy, which included an instructional DVD and book alongside the album.
- The Stanton Moore Trio's album Conversations was developed over more than a year and a half of Tuesday-night performances at Snug Harbor, a renowned New Orleans jazz venue on Frenchman Street, allowing the musicians to forge deep chemistry before recording.
- Moore is a partner in the Crescent Cymbal Company alongside Jeff Hamilton, demonstrating his involvement in the business side of drumming equipment and manufacturing.
- On the Allen Toussaint tribute album With You In Mind, Cyril Neville was initially brought in to perform on two songs but became so engaged with the project that he ultimately recorded five tracks, showcasing the organic creative process of the collaboration.
