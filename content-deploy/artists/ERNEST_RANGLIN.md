## Biography
Ernest Ranglin, born June 19, 1932 in Manchester Parish, Jamaica, was immersed in music from an early age, learning guitar from his uncles and receiving formal sight-reading instruction from violinist Tommy Tomlins[2][4]. By age 15, he was performing with the Val Bennett Orchestra, and soon joined the Eric Deans Orchestra, gaining experience in jazz and mento. His move to Kingston exposed him to Jamaica's burgeoning music scene, where he became a sought-after session guitarist and arranger for key producers and labels, including Studio One and Island Records[2][3].

Ranglin played a pivotal role in the birth and evolution of Jamaican popular music, contributing to mento, ska, rocksteady, and reggae. He worked closely with influential figures such as Coxsone Dodd, Duke Reid, Prince Buster, and Chris Blackwell, and played guitar on foundational tracks like the Ethiopians' 'Train to Skaville,' Toots and the Maytals' '54-46 That's My Number,' and the Melodians' 'Rivers of Babylon'[1][3]. His international recognition grew after a successful stint as resident guitarist at Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club in London in 1964, which led to collaborations with jazz musicians and further acclaim[2].

Ranglin's musical style is distinguished by his innovative blend of jazz, mento, and reggae, characterized by rhythmic skank, muted-string techniques, and percussive solos. He is credited with helping to invent the ska and reggae guitar sound, influencing generations of musicians worldwide. His solo albums, notably 'Ranglin Roots' (1972) and 'Below the Bassline' (1996), showcase his jazz-reggae fusion and enduring creativity. Ranglin's legacy is cemented by his role as a foundational architect of Jamaican music, his mentorship of younger artists, and his international recognition, including induction into the Jamaican Music Hall of Fame and an honorary doctorate from the University of the West Indies[3].

## Fun Facts
- Legend has it the term 'ska' was coined to describe Ranglin's guitar sound, though he claims to have invented the music, not the word[3].
- He was voted top guitarist in the 1964 Melody Maker Reader's Jazz Poll after his residency at Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club in London[2].
- Ranglin was inducted into the Jamaican Music Hall of Fame and received an honorary doctorate from the University of the West Indies[3].
- His farewell tour in 2016 featured an international ensemble with musicians from Nigeria, Senegal, England, and the U.S.[3].
