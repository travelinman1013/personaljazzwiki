## Biography
David Axelrod (April 17, 1933 – February 5, 2017) was an American musician, composer, arranger, and producer whose innovative approach bridged jazz, rock, R&B, and orchestral music. Born and raised in South Central Los Angeles, Axelrod grew up immersed in the sounds of R&B and jazz, influenced by his father's involvement in radical labor politics. After a brief stint as a boxer, he entered the music industry as a studio musician and soon became a sought-after producer and arranger, producing his first album, Harold Land’s 'The Fox,' in 1959.

Axelrod's major break came in 1964 when he joined Capitol Records as an in-house producer and A&R executive. There, he championed black artists and produced a string of successful albums for Lou Rawls, including the Grammy-winning 'Dead End Street,' and worked closely with jazz luminary Cannonball Adderley, producing the hit 'Mercy, Mercy, Mercy.' Axelrod's solo career began in 1968 with the release of 'Song of Innocence,' followed by 'Songs of Experience,' both inspired by William Blake's poetry and noted for their lush orchestration, heavy drums, and avant-garde themes. He continued to push boundaries with projects like the Electric Prunes' 'Mass in F Minor' and his own 'Earth Rot,' which addressed environmental concerns. Though his style fell out of favor in the disco era, Axelrod's work was rediscovered and widely sampled by hip-hop artists in the 1990s and 2000s, cementing his legacy as a genre-defying innovator whose influence endures across generations.
