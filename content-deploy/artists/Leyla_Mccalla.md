## Biography
Leyla McCalla is a Haitian-American musician, singer, and songwriter renowned for her mastery of the cello, tenor banjo, and guitar. Born in Bayside, Queens, New York City to Haitian emigrant parents, McCalla spent her formative years in Maplewood, New Jersey, before moving to Accra, Ghana as a teenager due to her mother's work. This international upbringing, combined with her early classical training and exposure to West African music, deeply influenced her diasporic musical style. After returning to the United States, McCalla studied music at New York University, where she immersed herself in both classical and experimental music scenes, and later moved to New Orleans to further explore her creative voice and Haitian heritage.

McCalla's career took a significant turn when she was discovered busking in New Orleans and invited to join the Grammy-winning Carolina Chocolate Drops, a group dedicated to reviving African American string band traditions. She later became a founding member of Our Native Daughters, alongside Rhiannon Giddens, Amythyst Kiah, and Allison Russell, further cementing her role as a key figure in contemporary roots music. As a solo artist, McCalla has released several acclaimed albums, including 'Breaking the Thermometer' (2022), which explores the legacy of Haiti's Radio Haiti and the importance of a free press, and 'Sun Without the Heat' (2024), which draws on Afrobeat, Ethiopian, Brazilian, and American folk influences. Her work is celebrated for its blend of storytelling, social consciousness, and musical innovation, earning accolades from NPR, The Guardian, and Folk Alliance International.

McCalla continues to shape the musical landscape through her artistic leadership, educational projects, and collaborations. She serves as the artistic director of the Shockoe Institute in Richmond, Virginia, and has completed residencies at the University of Richmond and Montclair State University. Living in New Orleans with her family, McCalla remains dedicated to exploring the intersections of history, identity, and music, leaving a lasting legacy as a bridge between cultures and generations.
