## Biography
Ike Turner & the Kings of Rhythm grew out of Turner’s teenage band in Clarksdale, Mississippi, where he blended blues, boogie‑woogie, and big‑band dance music into a tight, hard‑driving ensemble that became one of the most respected live acts in the Mississippi Delta and later in East St. Louis. As a young pianist and guitarist, Turner absorbed local blues styles and jump‑blues band arrangements, then molded the Kings of Rhythm into a road‑hardened group whose club sets mixed raw electric blues, early rhythm and blues, and danceable instrumentals built around riffs and horn lines. The band’s early 1950s recording of “Rocket 88” (credited to Jackie Brenston and his Delta Cats) is widely regarded as a pioneering rock and roll record, showcasing distorted guitar, a heavy backbeat, and driving piano that pointed directly toward the new sound of rock.

Through the 1950s and early 1960s, Ike Turner led the Kings of Rhythm as both a performing band and a studio vehicle while he also worked as a talent scout and producer for labels such as Sun and Modern, helping shape the recorded sound of numerous Delta and Memphis blues artists. In the mid‑1950s he relocated to the St. Louis area, where a re‑formed Kings of Rhythm became a top regional attraction; this lineup later provided the core of the Ike & Tina Turner Revue once vocalist Tina Turner joined, adding tighter arrangements, backing vocalists, and a showband feel while still rooted in the Kings’ blues and R&B foundation. In later years, after personal and legal troubles, Turner revived the Kings of Rhythm name for touring and recording, fronting a seasoned ensemble that emphasized blues, soul, and funk grooves, and earning late‑career critical praise and awards for his band‑centered projects.

The Kings of Rhythm’s musical style is often described as an energetic bridge between postwar electric blues, rhythm and blues, and early rock and roll, built on groove‑heavy rhythm sections, horn stabs, and Turner's sharp bandleading and arranging sense. Their legacy lies not only in individual records but in their role as a working band that incubated major talent, backed a wide range of artists, and helped define the sound of mid‑century Black popular music on Southern and Midwestern stages. Although Ike Turner’s reputation became deeply clouded by his abusive behavior and later drug problems, the Kings of Rhythm as an ensemble are still recognized by historians as a crucial link in the evolution from Delta blues bands and jump ensembles to the showband‑style R&B and soul groups that dominated the 1960s and beyond.
