## Biography
T'Monde is a Louisiana-based Cajun trio formed in 2011, whose name translates from French as 'little world' or 'little people.' The group consists of Drew Simon (accordion, vocals), Megan Constantin (also known as Megan Brown, guitar, vocals), and Kelli Jones (fiddle, vocals). Each member is a seasoned musician, having performed with renowned Cajun ensembles such as the Pine Leaf Boys, the Savoy Family Band, and Steve Riley and the Mamou Playboys. Their shared passion for Cajun and Creole traditions brought them together, resulting in a sound described by Offbeat Magazine as 'a creative fusion of classic country and out-of-the-way Cajun.'[1][3][4][5]

T'Monde's repertoire spans the breadth of Cajun music, from early 20th-century dancehall tunes to contemporary interpretations, enriched by influences from classic country, ancient French ballads, and Creole folk. Their musicianship is marked by tight harmonies, soulful singing, and expressive instrumental interplay, making them a standout act in the modern Cajun scene. The trio has released several acclaimed albums, including 'Making Believe,' 'Yesterday’s Gone,' and 'Lights in the Harbor,' and has performed at major festivals across North America and Europe, helping to introduce Cajun music to new audiences while honoring its roots.[1][3][4][5]

T'Monde is recognized for both preserving and innovating within the Cajun tradition. Their collective achievements include a combined ten GRAMMY nominations, and their music is celebrated for its authenticity, emotional depth, and danceable energy. Through their recordings and live performances, T'Monde continues to inspire a new generation of musicians and listeners, ensuring the vitality of Louisiana's musical heritage.[4][5]
