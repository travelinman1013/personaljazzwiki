## Biography
Bing Crosby, born Harry Lillis Crosby on May 3, 1903, in Tacoma, Washington, was raised in a large Catholic family with deep musical roots. His father sang in local theater productions, while his mother taught Irish folk songs at home, instilling in Bing a love of music from an early age. After moving to Spokane as a child, Crosby attended Gonzaga High School and later Gonzaga University, initially pursuing law but soon turning to music, performing as a drummer and singer with the Musicaladers, a local band. 

Crosby's career took off in the mid-1920s when he teamed up with pianist Al Rinker, moving to Los Angeles to pursue show business. Their lively performances in vaudeville and on the radio caught the attention of major bandleaders, leading to Crosby joining Paul Whiteman's orchestra and later forming the Rhythm Boys trio. By the early 1930s, Crosby had launched a successful solo career, becoming a radio sensation and transitioning to film, where he starred in numerous musicals and comedies. His smooth baritone voice, relaxed singing style, and pioneering use of the microphone helped define the crooner era and set new standards for popular music recording.

Crosby became one of the most influential and best-selling recording artists of the 20th century, with nearly 300 hit singles and iconic songs like 'White Christmas.' He won an Academy Award for Best Actor in 'Going My Way' (1944) and became the first true multimedia star, excelling in radio, film, and television. His legacy endures through his vast catalog, his impact on vocal technique, and his role in shaping the modern entertainment industry.
