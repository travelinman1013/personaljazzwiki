## Biography
Gitkin is the musical alias of Brian J, a Brooklyn-born guitarist, composer, and producer whose career bridges the worlds of funk, blues, and global instrumental music. Initially gaining recognition as the guitarist, principal songwriter, and co-founder of the funk band Pimps of Joytime, Brian J established himself in the late 2000s with the group's energetic blend of party-funk and relentless touring. After relocating to New Orleans, he expanded his reputation as a sought-after producer and sideman, collaborating with icons such as Cyril Neville, Cedric Burnside, and Bernard Purdie.

Seeking a creative outlet beyond the boundaries of his earlier projects, Brian J launched Gitkin in 2018 with the album '5 Star Motel.' The project is characterized by richly atmospheric, reverb-laden guitar work and grooves that draw from Latin, African, Middle Eastern, and swampy New Orleans R&B influences. Gitkin's music is largely instrumental, described as 'International Cowboy Funk' and compared to acts like Khruangbin for its cinematic, evocative quality. Each subsequent album—'Safe Passage' (2020), 'Nowhere to Go But Everywhere' (2023), and 'Golden Age' (2024)—has further developed this global fusion, incorporating collaborators such as Carol C. and Assaf Spector, and exploring tonalities from Greek, Peruvian, and Tuareg musical traditions.

Gitkin's work has earned critical acclaim and a cult following, both for its genre-defying sound and its ability to evoke a sense of place and story without words. His live trio, featuring Palestinian musician Simon Moushabeck and Cuban American drummer Washington Duke, has brought his music to international audiences, further cementing his legacy as a boundary-pushing instrumentalist and producer.
