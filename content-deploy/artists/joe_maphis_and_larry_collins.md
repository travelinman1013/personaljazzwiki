## Biography
Joe Maphis, born May 12, 1921, in Suffolk, Virginia, was a virtuoso guitarist renowned as the 'King of the Strings.' He began playing guitar at age eleven, influenced by his father and uncle, and honed his skills performing in local square dance groups during the Great Depression. Maphis became a prominent figure in country and early rockabilly music, known for his dazzling speed, technical skill, and signature double-neck Mosrite guitar. He worked as a studio musician, contributed to film and TV soundtracks, and played with major artists, including serving as Ricky Nelson's first lead guitarist before James Burton.[3]

Larry Collins, born October 4, 1944, in Tulsa, Oklahoma, emerged as a child prodigy on guitar, mentored by Joe Maphis. Collins rose to fame as half of The Collins Kids, a brother-sister duo with his sister Lorrie, performing energetic rockabilly and country music. The Collins Kids became regulars on the influential 'Town Hall Party' TV show in the 1950s, thrilling audiences with their fast-paced guitar duets and youthful stage presence. Larry's style was shaped by both Maphis's mentorship and the R&B sounds he absorbed from late-night radio in Los Angeles.[1][2][5]

Together, Maphis and Collins recorded the album 'Fire on the Strings' (1957, Columbia Records), showcasing their twin-guitar virtuosity and blending bluegrass, rockabilly, and traditional country. Their innovative use of custom double-neck guitars and high-energy performances influenced generations of guitarists across genres. Maphis's and Collins's legacies endure through their recordings, their impact on the West Coast country and rockabilly scenes, and the musicians they inspired.
