## Biography
Steven Lee Cropper (October 21, 1941 – December 3, 2025) was an American guitarist, songwriter, and producer whose economical, groove‑driven playing helped define the sound of Southern soul and Memphis R&B. Born on a farm near Dora, Missouri, he moved with his family to Memphis at age nine, where exposure to gospel, country, R&B, and early rock and roll spurred him to pick up the guitar.[3] As a teenager he formed the Royal Spades with friends including bassist Donald “Duck” Dunn and guitarist Charlie Freeman; the group evolved into the Mar-Keys, whose 1961 instrumental hit “Last Night” became an early success for the studio that soon took the name Stax Records.[1][2][3]

Cropper quickly became central to Stax as a house guitarist, engineer, A&R man, songwriter, and producer, and as a founding member of Booker T. & the M.G.’s he helped craft landmarks like the 1962 instrumental “Green Onions.”[1][3][4] His taut rhythm work and concise fills underpin classic recordings by Otis Redding, Wilson Pickett, Sam & Dave, Carla Thomas, Johnnie Taylor, and many others, and he co‑wrote enduring songs including “In the Midnight Hour,” “Knock On Wood,” “634‑5789,” and “(Sittin’ On) The Dock of the Bay,” the latter completed shortly before Redding’s death in 1967.[1][2][3][4][5] After leaving Stax around 1970, he co‑founded TMI Studios in Memphis, worked with artists such as John Prine, Jeff Beck, Rod Stewart, Ringo Starr, and B.B. King, and later moved to Los Angeles and then Nashville, remaining an in‑demand session musician and producer.[2][3][6][7]

In the late 1970s, Cropper reached a new audience as a member of Levon Helm’s RCO All‑Stars and then as the deadpan, telecaster‑wielding guitarist in the Blues Brothers Band with John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd, appearing on the hit album “Briefcase Full of Blues” and in the films *The Blues Brothers* and *Blues Brothers 2000*.[1][2][3][4][6] He continued recording solo projects, touring with a reunited Booker T. & the M.G.’s (including work with Neil Young), and collaborating widely across rock, soul, and blues circles.[1][2][3] Frequently cited by peers such as Keith Richards and Jimi Hendrix and ranked among the greatest guitarists by *Rolling Stone* and *Mojo*, Cropper’s understated, song‑first style and his role in shaping the Stax sound have secured his legacy as one of the most influential rhythm guitarists and soul producers in American music history.[1][2][4][8]

## Fun Facts
- Cropper was sometimes nicknamed “The Colonel,” a moniker that followed him through his career and is noted in major biographies.[1]
- The Beatles, particularly John Lennon and Paul McCartney, admired Cropper’s playing and his production on Otis Redding records, and there were tentative plans for them to record in Memphis with him before their manager Brian Epstein canceled the idea over security concerns.[1]
- His first major hit as a band member, “Last Night” with the Mar-Keys, led directly to the small Memphis label Satellite changing its name to Stax Records, with Cropper soon becoming involved in nearly every Stax release of the 1960s.[1][2][3]
- English magazine *Mojo* once named Cropper the “greatest living guitar player,” and in a later list ranked him second only to Jimi Hendrix, underscoring the esteem in which fellow musicians and critics held his work.[2]
