## Biography
Canzetta Maria “Candi” Staton (pronounced STAY-tən) was born on March 13, 1940, in Hanceville, Cullman County, Alabama, where her father worked as a farmer and coal miner and her mother was a homemaker.[1][2][6] Raised in the church, she was singing solos by age four and joined the Jewell Gospel Trio as a young teenager, touring the 1950s gospel circuit with major acts like the Soul Stirrers, C. L. Franklin, and Mahalia Jackson, and recording sides for Nashboro, Apollo, and Savoy.[1][2][3][5] Sent with her sister to Jewell Christian Academy in Nashville around age 11–12, her vocal talent was nurtured in a strict religious environment that shaped the raw, emotional delivery that would define her later soul and disco work.[1]

In 1968, Staton transitioned from gospel to secular music when soul singer Clarence Carter introduced her to producer Rick Hall at FAME Studios in Muscle Shoals, Alabama, launching a remarkable run of Southern soul singles that earned her the title “First Lady of Southern Soul.”[1][3][4] For FAME and Capitol, she cut hits such as “I’d Rather Be an Old Man’s Sweetheart (Than a Young Man’s Fool),” “I’m Just a Prisoner (of Your Good Lovin’),” “Sweet Feeling,” her Grammy‑nominated cover of Tammy Wynette’s “Stand by Your Man,” and a much‑praised version of “In the Ghetto.”[1][3][4] In the mid‑1970s she reinvented herself as a disco and dance artist with producer Dave Crawford, scoring enduring club and chart hits including “Young Hearts Run Free,” “Victim,” and later disco‑soul interpretations like “Nights on Broadway.”[1][2][3][4] In the early 1980s she returned to gospel, co‑founding Beracah Ministries in Atlanta with then‑husband John Sussewell, recording numerous gospel albums and earning further Grammy nominations.[1][2][3]

From the late 1980s onward, Staton’s work continued to cross boundaries between gospel, soul, disco, and electronic dance music. In 1986 she recorded “You Got the Love,” co‑written as a Christian‑themed song that later became a massive UK dance anthem in 1991 when remixed and released as The Source featuring Candi Staton, ultimately becoming her best‑known record in Europe.[1][2][4] She sustained her career with albums for labels such as Intersound and Honest Jon’s, a major critical reappraisal via the 2004 compilation of her FAME recordings, and later projects like the 2014 album “Life Happens,” which included Rick Hall’s final production work and duets with Jason Isbell and John Paul White.[1][4] Over more than five decades she has received multiple Grammy nominations in both R&B and gospel, been inducted into the Alabama Music Hall of Fame and Christian Music Hall of Fame, and inspired generations of soul, country‑soul, disco, and house vocalists with her emotionally direct, gospel‑rooted voice and autobiographical songs about love, resilience, and survival.[1][3][4]

## Fun Facts
- Staton first sang a church solo at about four years old and was already performing in a gospel group by age eight, long before her soul and disco fame.[5][6]
- As a teenager with the Jewell Gospel Trio, she toured the gospel circuit alongside giants like the Soul Stirrers, C. L. Franklin, and Mahalia Jackson, giving her first‑hand exposure to some of the most important figures in 20th‑century gospel music.[2]
- Her song “You Got the Love,” originally conceived as a Christian‑themed track, became a UK club classic when remixed by The Source, and it was famously used over the final scene of the TV series Sex and the City.[1][2]
- Beyond music awards and Hall of Fame inductions, Staton founded the non‑profit A Veil of Silence to support victims of domestic violence, a cause closely tied to her own life experience.[4]
