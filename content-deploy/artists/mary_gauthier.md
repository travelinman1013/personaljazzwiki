## Biography
Mary Veronica Gauthier was born on March 11, 1962, in New Orleans and raised in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Her early life was marked by profound trauma and adversity—she spent time in orphanages and struggled with alcoholism and drug addiction before her teens. Despite these challenges, music became her lifeline and source of redemption. Before pursuing music professionally, Gauthier built a successful career as a renowned chef in Boston, using songwriting as a therapeutic tool to process her difficult past and newfound sobriety. At age 35, she began her musical journey in earnest, and at age 40, she made the pivotal decision to move to Nashville and pursue music full-time, releasing her groundbreaking debut album *Drag Queens in Limousines* in 1998.

Gauthier's musical style blends confessional Americana, alt-country, and folk traditions, characterized by emotionally resonant lyrics that explore themes of trauma, redemption, love, and loss. Her breakthrough came with the 2005 album *Mercy Now*, which received widespread critical acclaim and appeared on top 10 lists in major publications including the New York Times, LA Times, and Billboard Magazine. Over her 25-year career, she has established herself as a distinctive voice in American songwriting, never shying away from difficult self-exploration. Her 2010 album *The Foundling* delved into her adoption from a New Orleans orphanage and her search for her birth mother, while her 2018 collaborative project *Rifles & Rosary Beads*, created with wounded Iraq war veterans, earned her first Grammy nomination for Best Folk Album and demonstrated her commitment to using music as a healing and empathetic tool.

Gauthier's legacy extends beyond her own recordings—her songs have been recorded by dozens of acclaimed artists including Jimmy Buffett, Dolly Parton, Blake Shelton, Tim McGraw, Bettye LaVette, and Boy George. She has become a leading voice in supporting veterans through creative collaboration and has received numerous accolades, including recognition as International Artist of the Year by The Americana Association UK in 2019. Her memoir *Saved by A Song* (2021) further cemented her status as an important cultural figure, and her work is now taught at several universities. Through her authentic storytelling and powerful messages of resilience and hope, Gauthier has created a body of work that resonates across generations and continues to inspire both artists and audiences.
