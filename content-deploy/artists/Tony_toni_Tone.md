## Biography
Tony! Toni! Toné! is a pioneering R&B group formed in Oakland, California in 1986 by half-brothers D'Wayne Wiggins and Raphael Wiggins (later known as Raphael Saadiq), along with their cousin Timothy Christian Riley[2][8]. Their early years were shaped by the vibrant Oakland music scene, where they performed with various local acts and gained experience backing artists such as Sheila E. before launching their own project[3]. Their debut album, 'Who?' (1988), produced by Denzil Foster and Thomas McElroy, established them as major contenders in R&B, with hits like "Little Walter" and "Baby Doll"[2][3][8].

The group’s sound is noted for its seamless blend of new jack swing, gospel, classic soul, and funk, incorporating vintage techniques with contemporary studio innovations[2]. Their second album, 'The Revival' (1990), which they produced themselves, reached platinum status and featured crossover hits such as "Feels Good" and "It Never Rains (In Southern California)"[2][3][8]. 'Sons of Soul' (1993) marked the creative apex of their career, earning Grammy nominations and spawning enduring tracks like "Anniversary" and "If I Had No Loot"[2]. Their final studio album, 'House of Music' (1996), reflected their individual growth and continued their streak of chart success[2][4].

Tony! Toni! Toné!'s legacy is defined by their innovative fusion of tradition and modernity in R&B, influencing the genre’s evolution into neo-soul and beyond[2]. After disbanding in the late 1990s, members pursued successful solo careers, most notably Raphael Saadiq, and contributed to the development of future stars such as Destiny's Child[2]. Their music remains influential, and their 2023 reunion tour demonstrated their enduring appeal to fans across generations[2].
