## Biography
Katherine Henderson (June 23, 1909 – September 1, 2002) was an American classic female blues singer born in St. Louis, Missouri. She began performing as a child in minstrel and vaudeville shows, influenced by her musically prominent family—her aunt was singer Eva Taylor and her uncle was the noted jazz pianist and composer Clarence Williams. By the late 1920s, Henderson had moved to New York, where she became active on the city’s vibrant music scene, occasionally substituting for her aunt Eva Taylor on local radio.

Henderson’s recording career peaked in 1927–1928, when she recorded approximately ten sides for Brunswick and QRS Records, often accompanied by Clarence Williams’s Blue Five or his Orchestra. She also starred in Williams’s stage musical 'Bottomland' and appeared in other theatrical revues such as 'Keep Shuffling.' Her vocal style was characterized by a dramatic, sometimes lachrymose delivery that set her apart from her contemporaries. Although her recording output was limited, she continued to perform live until 1944, after which she returned to St. Louis, married, and raised a family.

Despite her relatively brief recording career, Henderson’s work is noted for its connection to the classic blues and vaudeville traditions of the era. Her collaborations and family ties placed her at the heart of the Harlem Renaissance’s musical developments, and her recordings remain a testament to the transitional period between vaudeville, blues, and early jazz.
