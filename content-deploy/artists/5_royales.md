## Biography
The '5' Royales were a pioneering American rhythm and blues vocal group originating from Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Formed in the early 1940s as the gospel-based Royal Sons Quintet, they transitioned to secular music in the early 1950s, adopting the name 'The 5 Royales.' Their blend of gospel, jump blues, and doo-wop made them a foundational influence in the development of soul and rock and roll. The group was led by the powerful vocals of Johnny Tanner and the innovative songwriting and guitar work of Lowman 'Pete' Pauling, whose compositions often became hits for both the group and other artists.[1][3][4]

The 5 Royales achieved major R&B chart success in the early 1950s with songs like 'Baby Don’t Do It' and 'Help Me Somebody,' both written by Pauling. Their music retained a strong gospel influence, which set them apart from many contemporaries and paved the way for the emotional directness of later soul music. The group recorded for several major labels, including Apollo and King Records, and their repertoire included both heartfelt ballads and witty, risqué tunes. Their song 'Dedicated to the One I Love' became a pop standard, later covered by the Shirelles and the Mamas & the Papas, while 'Think' and 'Tell the Truth' were also widely influential and covered by artists such as James Brown and Ray Charles.[1][2][3]

Despite not always achieving commercial success, the 5 Royales' impact on American music was profound. Their innovative guitar work, vocal harmonies, and songwriting influenced a generation of musicians, including James Brown, Steve Cropper, and Eric Clapton. The group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2015, cementing their legacy as architects of soul and rock and roll.[1][5]
