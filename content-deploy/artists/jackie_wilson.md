## Biography
Jackie Wilson, born Jack Leroy Wilson Jr. on June 9, 1934, in Detroit, Michigan, emerged from a challenging childhood marked by poverty, gang involvement, and time in juvenile correctional facilities. His mother, Eliza, was a major influence, encouraging his early interest in gospel and blues singing on Detroit's streets[2][7][8]. Wilson's natural vocal talent led him to form the Ever Ready Gospel Singers in his teens, and after a brief stint as a Golden Gloves boxing champion, he turned to music full-time, performing in local clubs and joining groups like The Falcons and The Thrillers[1][2].

Wilson's big break came in 1953 when he replaced Clyde McPhatter as lead singer of Billy Ward and His Dominoes, where he honed his dynamic stage presence and vocal style. In 1957, he launched a solo career with Brunswick Records, collaborating with songwriters Berry Gordy Jr. and Roquel "Billy" Davis on hits like "Reet Petite" and "Lonely Teardrops." His energetic performances and versatile tenor voice earned him the nickname "Mr. Excitement," and he became a key figure in the transition from rhythm and blues to soul, influencing the sound of Motown and popularizing up-tempo dance numbers as well as heartfelt ballads[1][2][3][4].

Despite personal struggles with substance abuse and management disputes, Wilson's legacy endures through his pioneering fusion of doo-wop, rock, blues, and soul. His hits, including "(Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher and Higher," showcased his ability to captivate audiences with both vocal prowess and athletic dance moves. Wilson's influence extended far beyond his own recordings, shaping the careers of future soul and pop icons and earning him a lasting place in music history as one of the genre's most electrifying performers[2][3][4].
