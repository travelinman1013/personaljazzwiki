## Biography
Luther Allison (August 17, 1939 – August 12, 1997) was an American blues singer-songwriter and guitarist, celebrated for his electrifying live performances and soulful, high-energy guitar work[1][3][4]. Born in Widener, Arkansas as the 14th of 15 children, Allison's family moved to Chicago in 1951, where he immersed himself in the city's vibrant blues scene and was classmates with Muddy Waters' son[1][3][5]. He taught himself guitar, initially playing a diddley bow at age ten, and began performing in local clubs, eventually playing with the bands of Howlin' Wolf and Freddie King, and backing artists like James Cotton[1][3][5].

Allison's career gained momentum in the late 1960s, notably after his breakout performance at the 1969 Ann Arbor Blues Festival, which led to a recording contract with Delmark Records and later Motown's Gordy subsidiary—an unusual achievement for a blues artist at the time[2][4][5]. His style blended traditional blues with elements of funk, soul, and rock, earning him comparisons to Jimi Hendrix for his powerful guitar solos and dynamic stage presence[1][2]. After his U.S. career stalled, Allison moved to France in the early 1980s, where he became a European blues superstar, touring extensively and releasing several albums[2][4]. He returned to the U.S. in the 1990s, achieving renewed acclaim with a series of albums for Alligator Records and winning multiple Handy Awards before his death from cancer in 1997[2][4][5].

Allison's legacy endures through his recordings and the musicians he inspired, notably his son Bernard Allison, who continues to perform in his father's spirit[2]. His music remains influential for its passionate delivery, technical virtuosity, and its bridge between classic Chicago blues and modern blues-rock.
