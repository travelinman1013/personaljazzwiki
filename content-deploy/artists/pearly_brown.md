## Biography
Reverend Pearly Brown (1915–1986) was a blind gospel singer, guitarist, and preacher born in Abbeville, Georgia. Blind from birth, he lost his mother at a young age and was raised by his maternal grandparents in Americus, where he was introduced to gospel music and spirituals. Brown attended the Georgia Academy for the Blind in Macon, where he learned Braille and began playing guitar, inspired by the street musicians he heard around him. After graduating, he was ordained as a minister and began performing on the streets of Americus in 1939, later expanding his reach to cities across Georgia and Florida.

Brown’s musical style was deeply rooted in traditional spirituals, gospel blues, and what he called "slave songs," always performed from a religious perspective. He was particularly known for his bottleneck slide guitar technique, influenced by blues legends like Blind Lemon Jefferson and Blind Willie Johnson. Throughout the 1950s to 1970s, Brown became a fixture on the streets of Macon, Georgia, and gained wider recognition in the 1960s and 1970s, performing at prestigious venues such as Carnegie Hall, the Newport Folk Festival, and the Monterey Jazz Festival. He was also the first Black artist to appear on the Grand Ole Opry. His discography includes the albums "Georgia Street Singer" (1961) and "It's a Mean Old World to Try to Live In" (1975), the latter of which inspired a documentary film about his life.

Despite his modest means and humble street performances, Brown left a lasting legacy on American roots music. His influence extended to both gospel and blues musicians, and his message of love and brotherhood resonated with audiences and fellow artists alike. Brown continued to perform until ill health forced him to retire in 1979. He died in Plains, Georgia, in 1986, remembered as one of the last great blues street singers and a vital figure in the preservation of traditional African American music.
