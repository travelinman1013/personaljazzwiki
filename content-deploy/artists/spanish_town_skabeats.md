## Biography
The Spanish Town Skabeats, also known as The Spanishtonians, were a Jamaican ska band that emerged during the formative years of Jamaica's popular music scene in the early 1960s. The group consisted of three members: Winston Jones, Cynthia Webber, and Merlene Webber (collectively known as The Webber Sisters). Operating during a pivotal period when Jamaican music was synthesizing jazz influences with local folk traditions and R&B sounds, the Spanish Town Skabeats contributed to the development of ska as a distinct musical genre that would define Jamaica's cultural output for decades to come.

The band is best remembered for their 1965 ska composition "Stop That Train," a song that would become one of the most influential and sampled tracks in Jamaican music history. The original version presented the narrative of a woman pleading with a train conductor to stop the locomotive so she could join her departing boyfriend. Though the Spanish Town Skabeats' original recording achieved recognition within Jamaica's vibrant music scene, it was a 1967 cover version by the duo Keith & Tex that catapulted the song to international prominence. This rocksteady rendition, which reversed the gender perspective of the lyrics, became Keith & Tex's biggest hit and established "Stop That Train" as a foundational track that would be repeatedly sampled and reinterpreted by artists across multiple genres and decades.
