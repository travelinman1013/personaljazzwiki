## Biography
Shiloh Ites refers to the independent roots and culture record label and musical project founded by Iyah One in Amsterdam in 1998. Iyah One, originally known as Iyah One within the King Shiloh Soundsystem family, gained his foundational experience in the Amsterdam reggae scene during the 1990s, contributing to early productions and sessions linked to King Shiloh's operations in studios across West Europe, including Cologne, Germany.[2][3] Emerging from the vibrant soundsystem culture fostered by King Shiloh, which Iyah One was part of 'all those years ago,' he established Shiloh Ites Music to focus on roots reggae and dub, releasing works that emphasize cultural and spiritual themes.[2][3]

The label's musical style is deeply rooted in classic Jamaican influences such as Studio One's fat drum and bass sound, Augustus Pablo's Rockers era, and producers like Yabby U, reflecting the hard-edged, rebellious reggae that shaped Iyah One's entry into the genre via punk-reggae crossovers in the UK during the late 1970s.[2] Shiloh Ites has produced and released 7-inch singles and digital releases featuring raw roots tunes, continuing the tradition of independent dub and culture music amid Amsterdam's evolving soundsystem scene.[3][4][6] Key outputs include collaborations that maintain the tuff, message-driven sound of early European reggae production.[2]

Shiloh Ites' legacy lies in sustaining authentic roots reggae production in Europe, bridging Amsterdam's historic Dub Club Y2K era with contemporary releases, and supporting vocalists in the global dub underground. As an ongoing independent venture, it represents the enduring impact of figures like Iyah One, who transitioned from soundsystem utility roles to label head, producing 'great Roots tunes' into the present day.[2][3]
