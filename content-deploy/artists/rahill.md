## Biography
Rahill Jamalifard, a first-generation Iranian-American multidisciplinary artist, musician, DJ, and singer-songwriter, was born in Lansing, Michigan, on the outskirts of Detroit, to parents who immigrated to the US around the time of the Iranian hostage crisis in the late 1970s. Growing up in an Iranian-American household, she was immersed in traditional Iranian music shared by her father, alongside influences from MTV, BET, R&B, pop, and library CDs, fostering her early passion for music despite initial piano lessons that failed to inspire her. She dreamed of rapping like Salt-n-Pepa or Aaliyah but initially pursued poetry and drawing, later working at Academy Records in Brooklyn, which expanded her eclectic tastes.[1][3][6][9]

Rahill's career developed as the vocalist and founding member of the Brooklyn-based garage-rock/psychedelic surf band Habibi, where she honed her skill in blending diverse influences into heavy pop songs infused with Iranian modes and melodies. She also fronts the New York-based group Roya. Transitioning to solo work, she released the EP Sun Songs, followed by her debut album Flowers At Your Feet in 2023 on Big Dada, produced by Alex Epton. The album, written over three years including the pandemic, features personal reflections on family—including voicemails in English and Farsi, tributes to her sister, father, and late aunt—delivered in a style marked by bright, reverberating samples, thumping rhythms, and relaxed, infectious melodies reflecting her Iranian heritage, nurtured through trips to Iran.[1][2][3][8]

Now based in upstate New York's Hudson Valley, Rahill's music emphasizes authentic self-expression, maturity, and intimacy, with collaborations extending to fashion, such as performing at Maryam Nassir Zadeh's SS23 New York Fashion Week show. Her work continues to evolve, celebrating Iran's rich pop history while embracing global influences, positioning her as a versatile artist committed to community over fame.[1][4]
