## Biography
Bobby 'Boris' Pickett & The Crypt-Kickers was the project of Robert George Pickett, an American singer-songwriter and comedian born in Somerville, Massachusetts, on February 11, 1938. Growing up, Pickett was immersed in classic horror films, thanks to his father's job as a movie theater manager, which inspired his lifelong love of monster movies and his talent for impersonating Hollywood stars like Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi. After serving in the U.S. Army, Pickett moved to Hollywood to pursue acting and sang with local bands, where his Karloff impression became a crowd favorite.

In 1962, Pickett co-wrote the novelty song 'Monster Mash' with Leonard Capizzi, spoofing both the era's dance crazes and classic horror tropes. The song, produced by Gary S. Paxton and featuring musicians such as pianist Leon Russell and drummer Mel Taylor, was released under the name 'Bobby (Boris) Pickett & The Crypt-Kickers.' Despite initial rejections by major labels, 'Monster Mash' became a number one hit on the Billboard Hot 100 and has since become a perennial Halloween anthem, re-charting multiple times over the decades. Pickett continued to record parodies and appeared in various media, but never matched the commercial success of his signature hit. He published an autobiography in 2005 and remained a pop culture figure until his death from leukemia in 2007.

Pickett's musical style is characterized by novelty, humor, and theatricality, blending doo-wop, rock and roll, and spoken-word impersonations. His legacy endures through 'Monster Mash,' which remains a staple of Halloween celebrations and has influenced generations of musicians and entertainers who embrace humor and camp in music.

## Fun Facts
- 'Monster Mash' was banned by the BBC in the UK for being 'too morbid,' but later became a hit there in 1973.
- The iconic sound effects in 'Monster Mash' were created with everyday objects, such as blowing through a straw in water for bubbling sounds and pulling a nail from wood for creaking doors.
- Pickett wrote 'Monster Mash' in about 30 minutes, and the song was recorded in a similarly short session.
- Leon Russell, later a rock legend, played piano on the B-side of the original single but arrived too late for the main track.
