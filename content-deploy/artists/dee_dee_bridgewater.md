## Biography
Dee Dee Bridgewater, born Denise Eileen Garrett on May 27, 1950, in Memphis, Tennessee, is a celebrated American jazz singer and actress whose career spans over five decades. Raised in Flint, Michigan, she was immersed in jazz from an early age through her father, Matthew Garrett, a jazz trumpeter and educator. Bridgewater began performing in clubs as a teenager and later attended Michigan State University and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where she toured the Soviet Union with the university's jazz band in 1969.

Her professional breakthrough came in the early 1970s as the lead vocalist for the Thad Jones/Mel Lewis Jazz Orchestra in New York City. Bridgewater quickly became a sought-after collaborator, performing and recording with jazz legends such as Dizzy Gillespie, Sonny Rollins, Dexter Gordon, Max Roach, and Clark Terry. Her debut solo album, 'Afro Blue,' was released in 1974, and she soon expanded her career to Broadway, earning a Tony Award for her role as Glinda in 'The Wiz.' After a period exploring pop and R&B in the 1980s, Bridgewater relocated to Paris, where she returned to her jazz roots, self-producing acclaimed albums and earning multiple Grammy Awards, including for her tributes to Ella Fitzgerald and Billie Holiday.

Bridgewater is renowned for her dynamic vocal style, blending elements of jazz, blues, and international influences, and for her fearless reinterpretation of jazz standards. Her legacy includes not only her recordings and stage performances but also her role as a radio host and humanitarian, serving as a United Nations Goodwill Ambassador. She is widely regarded as one of the preeminent jazz vocalists of her generation, bridging musical traditions and inspiring countless artists worldwide.
