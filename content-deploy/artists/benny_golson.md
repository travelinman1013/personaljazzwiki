## Biography
Benny Golson (January 25, 1929 – September 21, 2024) was an American jazz tenor saxophonist, composer, and arranger, widely recognized as a leading figure in the hard bop movement. Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Golson began his musical journey with piano lessons at age nine and was deeply influenced by classical composers before switching to saxophone at fourteen, inspired by Arnett Cobb's performance with Lionel Hampton's band. His formative years were spent among future jazz luminaries such as John Coltrane, Red Garland, Jimmy Heath, and Philly Joe Jones, and he later studied at Howard University, where he honed his skills as a composer and arranger[1][4].

Golson's professional career took off in the early 1950s, performing and writing for the big bands of Lionel Hampton, Dizzy Gillespie, Johnny Hodges, and Earl Bostic. He was a key member of Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers, contributing classic compositions like "Moanin'," "Along Came Betty," and "Blues March." In 1959, Golson co-founded the influential sextet The Jazztet with trumpeter Art Farmer, which became a platform for his original works and featured notable musicians such as Curtis Fuller and McCoy Tyner. From the late 1960s, Golson shifted focus to studio and television work, composing for shows like "M*A*S*H," "Mission: Impossible," and "The Partridge Family," before returning to jazz performance and recording in the mid-1970s[1][4][5].

Golson's musical style evolved from a mainstream-modern tenor saxophone sound, influenced by Don Byas, to incorporating techniques inspired by his friend John Coltrane. He is celebrated for his eloquent melodic writing and his role in shaping the hard bop genre. Many of his compositions, including "I Remember Clifford," "Whisper Not," "Stablemates," "Killer Joe," and "Blues March," are now considered jazz standards. Golson's legacy is marked by his prolific output, his impact on jazz composition and performance, and his mentorship of younger musicians. He received numerous honors, including the Grammy Trustees Award in 2021[1][4].
