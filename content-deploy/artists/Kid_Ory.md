## Biography
Edward 'Kid' Ory (December 25, 1886 – January 23, 1973) was a pioneering American jazz trombonist, composer, and bandleader, born in LaPlace, Louisiana. Raised in a French-speaking Creole family, Ory began his musical journey as a child, crafting homemade instruments and initially playing banjo—a skill that influenced his later trombone technique. By his teens, he was leading the Woodland Band, one of the most respected ensembles in southeast Louisiana, and moved his group to New Orleans at age 21, quickly becoming a central figure in the burgeoning jazz scene.

Ory's career flourished as he developed the 'tailgate' trombone style, characterized by rhythmic, staccato lines and expressive glissandos, which became a defining feature of New Orleans jazz. In 1919, he relocated to Los Angeles and formed Kid Ory’s Creole Orchestra, which, in 1922, made the first jazz recording by a Black New Orleans band ('Ory’s Creole Trombone'). By the mid-1920s, Ory was in Chicago, collaborating with legendary figures such as King Oliver, Louis Armstrong (notably in Armstrong’s Hot Five and Hot Seven), and Jelly Roll Morton’s Red Hot Peppers. After a hiatus during the Great Depression, Ory returned to prominence in the 1940s, leading bands during the New Orleans jazz revival and performing on influential radio broadcasts like 'The Orson Welles Almanac.'

Ory's robust, earthy trombone sound and innovative use of glissando left a lasting mark on jazz. He codified the trombone’s role in early jazz ensembles and mentored or collaborated with many future jazz greats. His composition 'Muskrat Ramble' (1926) became a jazz standard. Ory retired in 1966, leaving a legacy as a foundational architect of New Orleans jazz, and died in Honolulu, Hawaii, in 1973.
