## Biography
Joe Haymes was born in Marshfield, Missouri, in 1908. His early life was marked by a unique blend of circus performances as a trapeze artist and drummer, alongside teaching himself piano and arranging music for local dance bands[1][2]. He began his professional music career as an arranger for Ted Weems' orchestra before forming his own band in 1930. Haymes' orchestra gained recognition for its performances at prominent venues like Roseland in New York City and for introducing songs such as 'I Cover the Waterfront'[2]. His career spanned several decades, with significant contributions during the big band and swing eras of the 1930s and 1940s[3]. Haymes continued to lead bands and work in studios throughout his career, eventually joining the CBS studio band in New York[1]. His musical style was characterized by big band arrangements and a blend of jazz and swing influences. Despite his contributions to the era, Haymes eventually faded from the music scene during the 1940s[2]. His legacy remains in the arrangements and recordings he left behind, which continue to be celebrated for their contribution to the swing era.
