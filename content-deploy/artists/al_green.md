## Biography
Al Green, born Albert Leornes Greene on April 13, 1946, in Forrest City, Arkansas, is one of the most influential soul singers of the 20th century. Raised in a large, musically gifted family, Green began his singing career in the gospel group the Green Brothers, touring the South before relocating to Grand Rapids, Michigan. His early exposure to gospel was tempered by a fascination with secular artists like Jackie Wilson, which led to his expulsion from the family group at age sixteen.

Green formed his first R&B group, the Creations (later Al Green and the Soul Mates), and achieved a minor hit with "Back Up Train" in 1967. His career took a pivotal turn in 1969 when he met producer Willie Mitchell in Texas. Mitchell invited Green to Memphis and signed him to Hi Records, where their collaboration defined the lush, emotionally charged Memphis soul sound of the early 1970s. Green's smooth falsetto and heartfelt delivery produced a string of classic hits, including "Let's Stay Together," "Tired of Being Alone," and "Love and Happiness." By the mid-1970s, Green shifted focus to gospel music after a personal spiritual awakening, becoming an ordained pastor and recording gospel albums, while occasionally returning to secular music in later years.

Green's legacy is profound: he is celebrated as "The Last of the Great Soul Singers" and has influenced generations of artists across genres. Inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995, Green has won 11 Grammy Awards and remains a towering figure in American music, known for his unique blend of gospel fervor and sensual soul.
