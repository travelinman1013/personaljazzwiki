## Biography
Jimmie Davis (born James Houston Davis, c. 1899 in Beech Springs, Louisiana) was a multifaceted figure in American culture, celebrated as a country and gospel singer, songwriter, and two-term governor of Louisiana. Raised as one of eleven children to sharecropper parents, Davis worked his way through Louisiana College and Louisiana State University, earning a master's degree in education. He began his musical journey singing in college groups and busking on street corners to fund his education, later teaching at a Baptist college while performing on local radio.

Davis signed his first record deal in 1929, initially recording blues and risqué songs before achieving major success with country hits like 'Nobody's Darling But Mine' and, most famously, 'You Are My Sunshine.' The latter became an American classic, covered by countless artists and adopted as Louisiana's official state song. His smooth vocal style and blend of country, western swing, and gospel helped popularize these genres beyond their southern roots. Davis's career was marked by a unique crossover between music and politics; he used his musical persona to connect with voters, earning the nickname 'the singing governor.'

After his initial country music fame, Davis transitioned to gospel in the 1950s, recording extensively and maintaining a public presence for over 70 years. His legacy endures through his induction into the Country Music Hall of Fame, the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame, and the Gospel Music Hall of Fame, making him a singular figure in both music and political history.
