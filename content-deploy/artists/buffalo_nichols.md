## Biography
Buffalo Nichols, born Carl Nichols in Houston, Texas, and raised in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, is a modern blues guitarist and singer-songwriter whose music bridges tradition and innovation. Growing up, he was immersed in gospel music through singing in the Baptist church and was influenced by his mother's collection of blues records, including Son House, Keb' Mo', and Skip James. At age 11 or 12, he began playing guitar, initially to avoid team sports, and quickly became self-taught, learning punk and metal riffs before gravitating toward blues and roots music[1][2][3][4].

Nichols' early musical journey included playing in local bands and releasing a death metal demo at age 14, but as his skills outpaced his peers, he sought broader opportunities, eventually working as a hired guitarist across genres. Despite his technical growth, he found this work creatively limiting and ultimately channeled his diverse influences into his solo project as Buffalo Nichols. His music, while often labeled as blues, draws from a wide spectrum of genres, reflecting his belief that artists should not be confined to a single style. Nichols is known for his emotive songwriting, resonator guitar work, and a sound that honors blues traditions while pushing their boundaries for contemporary audiences[1][5].

Now based in Austin, Texas, Nichols continues to write, record, and perform, earning acclaim for his bold, heartfelt songs and his commitment to expanding the definition of modern blues[6].
