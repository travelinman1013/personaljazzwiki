## Biography
Big Bad Voodoo Daddy is a contemporary swing band formed in 1989 in Ventura, California, by leader Scotty Morris (vocals and guitar) and Kurt Sodergren (drums), who remain the core original members. The band initially played 1940s and 1950s swing music in clubs and lounges in Southern California, gaining traction with a regular Wednesday night residency at the Derby nightclub in Hollywood during the grunge era, where they revived interest in swing, jazz, and Dixieland blended with modern energy.[1][2][3] Their breakthrough came in 1996 when songs like 'You & Me & The Bottle Makes Three Tonight (Baby)' and 'Go Daddy-O' featured in the indie film Swingers, leading to a signing with Capitol Records and releases such as Americana Deluxe and This Beautiful Life.[1]

The band achieved widespread recognition with high-profile performances, including the Super Bowl XXXIII halftime show in 1999, appearances on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno (seven times), Dancing With The Stars, and collaborations with U.S. symphony orchestras. They have maintained a rigorous touring schedule of over 150 shows annually, releasing albums like Save My Soul, Everything You Want For Christmas, and a 2010 tribute How Big Can You Get?: The Music of Cab Calloway, while selling over 2 million albums and licensing music to hundreds of films and TV shows.[1][2][3][5] Their style spans swing, big band, electro swing, and rockabilly, emphasizing lively, danceable interpretations of classic American sounds.[1]

Over 35 years active as of 2025, Big Bad Voodoo Daddy's legacy lies in spearheading the 1990s swing revival, sustaining popularity through nonstop tours from the Hollywood Bowl to Lincoln Center, and performing for three U.S. Presidents, solidifying their role as enduring ambassadors of vintage swing in contemporary culture.[2][3][5]
