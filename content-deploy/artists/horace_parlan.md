## Biography
Horace Parlan (January 19, 1931 – February 23, 2017) was an influential American jazz pianist and composer, celebrated for his work in the hard bop and post-bop idioms. Born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Parlan faced significant adversity early in life after contracting polio at age five, which left his right hand partially paralyzed. Rather than letting this deter his musical ambitions, Parlan developed a unique piano technique, using strong, percussive left-hand chords and rhythmic right-hand phrases that became his signature sound. Inspired by a live performance by Vladimir Horowitz, he resumed piano studies in his youth and later left law school to pursue music full-time, quickly becoming a fixture in Pittsburgh's vibrant jazz scene.

Parlan's career took off in the late 1950s when he joined Charles Mingus' Jazz Workshop, contributing to landmark albums such as 'Mingus Ah Um' and 'Blues & Roots.' He soon became a prolific recording artist for Blue Note Records, both as a leader and a sought-after sideman, collaborating with jazz greats like Booker Ervin, Dexter Gordon, Lou Donaldson, and Rahsaan Roland Kirk. In 1973, Parlan relocated to Copenhagen, Denmark, where he continued to record and perform, notably in duet projects with Archie Shepp that explored gospel and spiritual themes. Parlan's soulful, blues-inflected style and his perseverance in the face of physical challenges left a lasting legacy in jazz, earning him international recognition and honors such as the Ben Webster Prize in 2000.
