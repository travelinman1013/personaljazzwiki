## Biography
Ray Stevens, born Harold Ray Ragsdale on January 24, 1939 in Clarkdale, Georgia, is a celebrated American singer, songwriter, producer, and comedian whose career spans more than six decades[2][4][5]. Stevens began piano lessons at age six, quickly developing a passion for music that led him to absorb influences from country, rhythm and blues, and classical styles during his youth in Albany, Georgia[1][5]. At seventeen, Stevens met Atlanta music publisher Bill Lowery, which launched his professional career; he recorded his first single, "Silver Bracelet," while still in high school and soon became a sought-after session musician and arranger in Nashville[1][4].

Stevens' versatility is evident in his extensive discography, which includes 45 studio albums and 93 singles[2]. He is best known for his comedic hits such as "Ahab the Arab," "Gitarzan," "The Streak," and "Shriner’s Convention," as well as serious and inspirational songs like "Everything Is Beautiful" and "Misty"[2][4]. His 1970 hit "Everything Is Beautiful" earned him a Grammy for Male Vocalist of the Year, while his bluegrass arrangement of "Misty" won him a Grammy for Best Arrangement in 1975[2][3]. Stevens has also produced, arranged, and performed on recordings for legendary Nashville artists, and his influence extends into television, with ventures like the Ray Stevens CabaRay Nashville show and his own entertainment theater[2].

Stevens' legacy is marked by his ability to blend comedy with musical excellence, earning him induction into the Country Music Hall of Fame, Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame, and Georgia Music Hall of Fame[2]. His innovative approach to novelty songs and his contributions as a producer and arranger have made him a pivotal figure in both country and comedy music, inspiring generations of artists and entertainers[2][5].
