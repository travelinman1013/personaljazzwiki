## Biography
Kiddus I, born Frank Louis Dowding Jr. in December 1944 in Saint Mary Parish, Jamaica, to a homemaker mother Maria Cathcart Dowding and bookkeeper father Frank Dowding, grew up in a middle-class family before embracing Rastafarianism in the early 1970s, adopting the Amharic stage name meaning 'blessed one.' In 1971, he established a Rastafarian commune and craft center between uptown and downtown Kingston, bridging social divides, and joined Ras Michael's Sons of Negus as a singer and funde drummer until 1978. His early recordings included self-produced tracks in 1972 with Aston Barrett at Joe Gibbs' studio, though unreleased due to funding issues, and singles like 'Security In The Streets' recorded with Lee Perry at Black Ark.[1][4][6]

Kiddus I gained prominence through his role in the 1978 film *Rockers*, where director Theodoros Bafaloukos filmed him recording 'Graduation In Zion,' a track he had cut in 1976. A key figure in Jamaica's Peace Movement, his song 'Security in the Streets' honored the 1978 Peace Treaty between rival gang leaders Claudie Massop and Bucky Marshall. After sporadic singles on his Shepherd label and a lost album, he reemerged in 2005 with the acoustic *Inna De Yard* on Makasound, followed by reissues like *Graduation In Zion: 1978-1980* (2007) on Dub Store and his electric debut *Green Fa Life* (2009) on Naya Records, featuring roots legends Earl 'Chinna' Smith and Leroy 'Horsemouth' Wallace. His style draws from blues, soul, jazz, R&B, and roots reggae.[1][2]

In 2007, 1981 album tapes surfaced, leading to the 2009 release of *Rocking Rebel Volumes 1&2*. Kiddus I launched the Green Fa Life project around 2009 to promote Moringa tree planting and products, and in 2014 staged the first Rastaman Vibration concert in Cheapside, St. Elizabeth, aiming for an annual festival. Later albums include *Topsy Turvy World* (2013), *Take A Trip* (2015), and *Shepard Singles: 1979-1985* (2023), cementing his enduring legacy in reggae.[1]
