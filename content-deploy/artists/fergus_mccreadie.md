## Biography
Fergus McCreadie is a Scottish jazz pianist and composer, acclaimed for his innovative fusion of jazz with traditional Scottish folk music. Born on July 12, 1997, in Jamestown, Easter Ross, Scotland, McCreadie’s early musical experiences included playing the bagpipes before a transformative encounter with jazz piano at age 12 shifted his focus. Despite humble beginnings practicing on a broken-down piano and later a Yamaha electric keyboard, he developed rapidly, attending Dollar Academy and graduating from the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland in 2018. There, he was mentored by prominent figures such as Paul Harrison and Tommy Smith, and participated in Smith’s Youth Jazz Orchestra.

McCreadie’s career accelerated with the formation of his piano trio alongside bassist David Bowden and drummer Stephen Henderson, both accomplished musicians in their own right. The trio’s debut album, 'Turas' (2018), rooted in Scottish folk tradition, garnered significant attention, winning Album of the Year at the Parliamentary and Scottish Jazz Awards and earning a Scottish Album of the Year Award shortlist. His subsequent albums, including 'Cairn' and 'Forest Floor,' received critical acclaim, with 'Forest Floor' topping the UK Jazz & Blues charts, winning the Scottish Album of the Year Award (the first jazz artist to do so), and being shortlisted for the 2022 Mercury Prize. McCreadie’s music is celebrated for its evocative storytelling, inspired by Scotland’s landscapes, and his performances are noted for their authenticity and emotional resonance.

By his mid-twenties, McCreadie had established himself as a leading voice in contemporary jazz, recognized for his technical mastery, compositional depth, and ability to connect with audiences. His work continues to push the boundaries of genre, blending jazz improvisation with the melodic and rhythmic sensibilities of Scottish folk, and earning him a place at major festivals and venues across the UK and Europe.
