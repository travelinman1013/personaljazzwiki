## Biography
Clifford Brown, born October 30, 1930, in Wilmington, Delaware, emerged as one of the most influential jazz trumpeters of the mid-20th century. Raised in a musical family, Brown began playing trumpet as a teenager and quickly distinguished himself with his lyrical improvisation, rich tone, and technical mastery. He attended Delaware State College and Maryland State College, where he played in jazz bands, and by the late 1940s was performing in Philadelphia alongside jazz luminaries such as Fats Navarro, Dizzy Gillespie, and Charlie Parker.

Brown's professional career accelerated after recovering from a serious car accident in 1950. He made his recording debut in 1952 with Chris Powell’s Blue Flames and soon joined Tadd Dameron’s band, followed by a European tour with Lionel Hampton’s big band in 1953. Brown’s style was deeply rooted in bebop but evolved into hard bop, characterized by melodic inventiveness and rhythmic sophistication. In 1954, he co-founded the Clifford Brown-Max Roach Quintet, a group widely regarded as one of the greatest hard bop ensembles. Brown’s compositions, including 'Joy Spring,' 'Daahoud,' and 'Sandu,' became jazz standards, and his recordings with artists such as Art Blakey, Sarah Vaughan, and Sonny Rollins are considered classics.

Tragically, Clifford Brown’s life and career were cut short when he died in a car accident on June 26, 1956, at just 25 years old. Despite his brief career, Brown’s influence on jazz trumpet was profound, setting new standards for lyrical improvisation, technical excellence, and emotional depth. His legacy endures through his recordings and the generations of musicians he inspired.
