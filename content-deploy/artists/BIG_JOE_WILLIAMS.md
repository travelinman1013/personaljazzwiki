## Biography
Joseph Lee "Big Joe" Williams was born on October 16, 1903, near Crawford in Oktibbeha County, Mississippi, on the edge of the Noxubee Swamp. Coming from a musical family that included his blues-performing grandfather Bert Logan and uncles Bert and Russ Logan, Williams epitomized the life of the traveling bluesman. He crafted his first instrument as a one-string guitar before becoming famous for his innovative nine-string guitar, created by adding three extra strings to a standard six-string guitar. Leaving home in his teens, Williams made his living playing at railway camps, turpentine operations, levee camps, and logging sites, while also traveling with minstrel troupes and medicine shows throughout the 1920s.

Williams's recording career began in 1930 with the Birmingham Jug Band for Okeh Records, but his breakthrough came in 1935 when he signed with Bluebird Records and recorded his signature song "Baby Please Don't Go," which he sometimes credited to his wife, blues singer Bessie Mae Smith. This song became one of the most covered blues standards in history, later recorded by Muddy Waters, Van Morrison with Them, and Bob Dylan. Throughout the 1930s and 1940s, Williams recorded extensively for Bluebird and Columbia labels, producing hits like "Crawlin' King Snake" (1941) and "Peach Orchard Mama." He became a fixture of the St. Louis blues scene in the 1930s before relocating to Chicago, though he never stopped his constant traveling.

When African American music trends shifted toward electric blues and rhythm and blues after World War II, Williams adapted by launching a second career as a "folk blues" artist in the late 1950s. He performed widely at coffeehouses, nightclubs, and festivals across America and Europe, recording numerous albums for labels including Delmark, Arhoolie, Testament, Bluesville, and Folkways. His legendary travels and cantankerous personality were documented in guitarist Mike Bloomfield's memoir "Me and Big Joe," and he became known for living in the basement of Chicago's Jazz Record Mart. Williams also worked as a talent scout, helping to locate and record many artists including J.D. Short and John Wesley "Mr. Shortstuff" Macon. He died on December 17, 1982, in Macon, Mississippi, and was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame on October 4, 1992.

## Fun Facts
- Williams created a distinctive nine-string guitar by adding three extra strings (doubling the D, B, and high E) to a standard guitar, producing what one historian described as 'the most buzzing, sizzling, African-sounding music' he had ever heard.
- According to Williams himself, he had to stop traveling with young Muddy Waters because women kept complimenting his 'young son,' and Waters was taking away his female attention: 'I had to put Muddy down because he was takin' away my women.'
- Williams lived in the basement of Chicago's Jazz Record Mart during his later years and became legendary for his cantankerous personality and indefatigable traveling spirit.
- He performed at Mike Bloomfield's 'blues night' at the Fickle Pickle using an electric nine-string guitar through a ramshackle amplifier with a pie plate nailed to it and a beer can dangling against it—when he played, everything rattled except Big Joe himself.
