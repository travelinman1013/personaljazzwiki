## Biography
The Hackberry Ramblers, a Cajun music band, were formed in 1933 in Hackberry, Louisiana, by fiddler Luderin Darbone and guitarist/accordionist Edwin Duhon, along with second guitarist Lennis Sonnier. Named after their small hometown on the Louisiana-Texas border, the group quickly gained local fame playing at dance halls and on radio stations like KFBL in Beaumont, Texas, blending Cajun traditions with Western swing, country, and early jazz influences from black New Orleans-style orchestras they heard locally.[1][2][4][5] In 1935, they began recording for RCA's Bluebird label, producing over 80 sides in the next five years, including French and English songs, with their 1936 French-language waltz 'Jolie Blonde' becoming a defining version of the Cajun national anthem thanks to Darbone's jazzy fiddle and Sonnier's vocals.[2][3][4]

The band's lineup evolved over decades, expanding in the 1940s to include electric instruments like guitar, bass, drums, lap steel, trumpet, and saxophone, while pioneering electric amplification in Cajun music. Duhon briefly left after two years for oil field work but rejoined later; Darbone remained the steadfast leader through numerous personnel changes. Revived in the 1960s by Arhoolie Records founder Chris Strachwitz, who reissued their material and brought them to wider audiences, they adapted further by adding accordion and incorporating rockabilly, R&B, and swamp pop. In 1998, after 65 years, they earned a Grammy nomination for *Deep Water* and performed on MTV.[2][3][4]

The Ramblers continued performing into the 21st century, receiving a National Heritage Fellowship in 2002 and playing internationally. Their final show was in Baton Rouge in November 2005, capping a 72-year run as one of America's longest-running bands, known for their hyphenated Cajun-country sound and enduring popularity along the Louisiana Gulf Coast.[2][3][5]
