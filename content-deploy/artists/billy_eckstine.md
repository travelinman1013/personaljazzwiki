## Biography
William Clarence Eckstine (July 8, 1914 – March 8, 1993) was an American jazz and pop singer and bandleader who became one of the most influential vocalists of the swing and bebop eras. Born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Eckstine initially pursued a football career but shifted to music after a collarbone injury. He began singing professionally at age seven and eventually made his way to Chicago, where he joined Earl Hines' Grand Terrace Orchestra in 1939 as a vocalist and occasional trumpeter, remaining until 1943. During this period, he achieved early success with juke-box hits including "Stormy Monday Blues" and "Jelly, Jelly," establishing himself as a rising talent in the jazz world.

In 1944, Eckstine formed his own big band, which became a revolutionary force in jazz history. Over its three-year existence (1944-1947), the band served as a launching pad for some of jazz's greatest innovators, including Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, Miles Davis, Art Blakey, Dexter Gordon, Fats Navarro, and Sarah Vaughan. The orchestra earned over $100,000 in just ten weeks and became famous for its call-and-response improvisations and bebop-laced arrangements. Eckstine's distinctive bass-baritone voice, characterized by rich vibrato and an almost operatic quality, set him apart as a vocalist who could bridge both jazz and popular music.

After disbanding his orchestra in 1947, Eckstine embarked on a highly successful solo career as a popular singer, recording lush, string-filled ballads for MGM Records. He became MGM's top-selling vocalist in 1950 and was nicknamed "The Sepia Sinatra" for his rivalry with Frank Sinatra's popularity—his 1950 appearance at the Paramount Theatre in New York City drew larger audiences than Sinatra's performance there. His romantic ballad recordings, including "Prisoner of Love," "My Foolish Heart," "I Apologize," and "Caravan," became million-selling hits and earned him top vocal honors in both Metronome and Down Beat magazines. Though his style seemed old-fashioned by the 1960s, Eckstine continued performing internationally until his death in 1993. He was posthumously awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2019 and is remembered as a groundbreaking artist who challenged racial barriers in the music industry and influenced generations of soul and R&B singers.

## Fun Facts
- Eckstine was the first African American singer to introduce a ballad live on a commercial radio station, recording 'Skylark' in 1942 after Earl Hines personally convinced record producers and even offered to pay damages if the record failed—it became a smash hit.
- His 1950 appearance at the Paramount Theatre in New York City drew a larger audience than Frank Sinatra's performance there, earning him the nickname 'The Sepia Sinatra' for his rivalry with the country's most popular vocalist.
- Eckstine broke new legal ground for African Americans by including clauses in his band's contracts that stipulated he and his musicians be permitted to sleep wherever they performed, rather than sleeping on buses or in segregated establishments.
- His recording of 'I Apologize' (MGM, 1951) was given the Grammy Hall of Fame Award in 1999, and he posthumously received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2019.
