## Biography
The Detroit Cobras, an American garage rock band from Detroit, Michigan, formed in 1995 by guitarist Steve Shaw, who drew inspiration from classic R&B after spending time with Alex Chilton through his connections with The Gories. The initial lineup featured vocalist Rachel Nagy, a former exotic dancer, alongside Shaw, guitarist Maribel Restrepo (also known as Mary Ramirez), bassist Jeff Meier from Rocket 455, and drummer Vic Hill, releasing their first 7-inch single in 1996. Known for their distinctive covers of obscure vintage R&B, soul, Motown, and primitive rock & roll tracks reinterpreted with a raw garage rock swagger, the band quickly emerged as a key player in Detroit's garage scene, prioritizing lost classics over mainstream hits.[1][2][3]

Frequent lineup changes marked their career, with drummers rotating from Vic Hill to Chris Fachini and Damian Lang by their 1998 debut album Mink Rat or Rabbit on Sympathy for the Record Industry. Shaw departed before the Jack White-produced Sympathetic Sounds of Detroit compilation, replaced by Dante Aliano on guitar and Rob Smith on bass, while Nagy's soulful vocals and Restrepo's muscular guitar lines remained constants. This instability fueled their evolution, leading to 2001's Life, Love and Leaving (Rough Trade in the UK, Sympathy in the US), the 2003 EP Seven Easy Pieces, 2004's Baby (with one original song, 'Hot Dog (Watch Me Eat)'), and 2007's Tied & True on Bloodshot Records, often featuring Greg Cartwright of Reigning Sound.[1][2][3]

The band's retro-garage formula garnered a strong US garage following and major UK buzz, solidifying their legacy as Detroit's premier cover interpreters blending '50s/'60s roots with punk-blues energy. Active since 1996, they continue touring with rotating members around Nagy and Ramirez, maintaining their party-band reputation in the garage rock underground.[1][2][4]
