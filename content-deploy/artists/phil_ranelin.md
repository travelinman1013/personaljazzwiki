## Biography
Phil Ranelin, born in 1939 in Indianapolis, Indiana, is a renowned jazz trombonist, composer, arranger, producer, bandleader, and educator. Growing up in Indianapolis, he was influenced by local jazz legends such as J.J. Johnson and Wes Montgomery, which shaped his early musical development[1][2][6]. Ranelin moved to Detroit in the 1960s, where he became a session musician for Motown, playing behind iconic acts like Stevie Wonder and The Temptations[5][6]. His versatility and deep understanding of jazz, funk, and soul allowed him to thrive in both commercial and avant-garde settings.

In 1971, Ranelin co-founded Tribe, a radical Detroit jazz collective and record label that empowered musicians to control their own careers, production, and distribution[1][2][3][4]. Tribe became a cornerstone of Detroit's jazz scene, blending free jazz, jazz funk, and soul jazz, and advocating for social and cultural change. Ranelin's work with Tribe, as well as his collaborations with artists like Freddie Hubbard and Horace Tapscott, helped redefine jazz in the 1960s and 1970s[1][3][4]. Since relocating to Los Angeles in 1977, Ranelin has continued to perform, compose, and mentor, earning recognition as a cultural ambassador and a 'Rare and Valuable Cultural Treasure' by various civic authorities[1].

Ranelin's musical style is rooted in the J.J. Johnson trombone tradition, characterized by warm tone, inventive improvisation, and a commitment to both technical mastery and emotional expression[1][7]. His legacy includes a rich discography, influential community work, and a lasting impact on generations of jazz musicians who value artistic independence and social consciousness.
