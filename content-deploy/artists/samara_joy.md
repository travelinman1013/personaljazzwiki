## Biography
Samara Joy McLendon was born on November 11, 1999, in the Castle Hill neighborhood of the Bronx, New York. As a child, she was captivated by classic R&B and gospel music, with her father—a vocalist and bass player who toured with gospel musician Andraé Crouch—introducing her to gospel greats such as The Clark Sisters and Motown legends. She honed her early singing skills in her church's gospel choir, eventually becoming a worship leader and singing three services a week for nearly two years. Her formal introduction to jazz came during her high school years at Fordham High School for the Arts, where she performed regularly with the school's jazz band and won Best Vocalist at Jazz at Lincoln Center's prestigious Essentially Ellington competition. However, jazz did not become her primary focus until she enrolled at SUNY Purchase College's acclaimed jazz program as a voice major, where she was named an Ella Fitzgerald Scholar and began studying with accomplished musicians including Jon Faddis and Kenny Washington. The turning point in her jazz journey came when friends introduced her to recordings of Sarah Vaughan and Ella Fitzgerald, with Vaughan's rendition of "Lover Man" and Tadd Dameron's recordings featuring trumpeter Fats Navarro proving particularly transformative. Drawing inspiration from jazz icons including Billie Holiday, Sarah Vaughan, Betty Carter, Abbey Lincoln, and Carmen McRae, Joy pursued her jazz studies with intense passion and won the 2019 Sarah Vaughan International Jazz Vocal Competition while still in college, graduating magna cum laude in 2021. Joy's professional career has been meteoric, marked by critical acclaim and industry recognition that has positioned her as perhaps the first Gen Z jazz singing star. Her self-titled debut album released in 2021 on the Whirlwind label earned her recognition as Best New Artist by JazzTimes. Her breakthrough came with her second album, Linger Awhile (2022), released on Verve Records, which reached number one on the Billboard Jazz Albums chart and earned widespread praise for her silky, velvety voice and precociously refined interpretive style. At the 2023 Grammy Awards, she won two awards including Best New Artist and Best Jazz Vocal Album, cementing her status as a major force in contemporary jazz. Her subsequent releases, including A Joyful Holiday and Portrait (co-produced with Grammy-winning trumpeter Brian Lynch), have continued to showcase her growth as a musician and bandleader, with Portrait earning an NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Jazz Album in 2025. Her performance history includes appearances at the most legendary venues and festivals in jazz, including the Newport, Monterey, and Montreal Jazz Festivals, as well as iconic stages like the Apollo, Carnegie Hall, the Village Vanguard, and Jazz at Lincoln Center. By age 25, Joy has already accumulated five Grammy Awards and established herself as a masterful interpreter of jazz standards and a rightful heir to the legacy of her jazz heroines.

## Fun Facts
- Joy did not begin singing jazz until age 18, making her rapid rise to prominence even more remarkable—she won the Sarah Vaughan International Jazz Vocal Competition just one year after enrolling in SUNY Purchase's jazz program.
- Before her jazz career, Joy had no formal music lessons until her first lesson at Purchase College with Alexis Cole, meaning her early musical training came entirely through church gospel singing and high school musical theater.
- Joy has amassed millions of likes on TikTok and has earned fans including acclaimed artists Anita Baker and actress Regina King, cementing her status as perhaps the first Gen Z jazz singing star with significant social media presence.
- Joy graduated from SUNY Purchase as valedictorian and recorded her self-titled debut album while still in college, demonstrating her exceptional talent and work ethic from the beginning of her professional career.
