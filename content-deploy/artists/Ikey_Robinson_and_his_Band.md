## Biography
Isaac L. "Banjo Ikey" Robinson (July 28, 1904 – October 25, 1990) was a pioneering American banjoist and vocalist, born in Dublin, Virginia. He began his musical journey performing locally before relocating to Chicago in 1926, a move that placed him at the heart of the jazz and blues scene during its formative years. Robinson quickly established himself as a versatile musician, adept at both jazz and blues, and became known for his energetic playing and distinctive vocal style.

During the late 1920s and 1930s, Robinson recorded extensively and collaborated with some of the era's most influential musicians, including Jelly Roll Morton, Clarence Williams, and Jabbo Smith. He led several groups, most notably Ikey Robinson and his Band, and was a member of ensembles such as The Hokum Trio, The Pods of Pepper, Windy City Five, and Sloke & Ike. His 1929 recording "Rock Me Mama" is often cited as an early use of the term "rock," linking his work to the roots of rock and roll. Robinson's career spanned decades, and he continued performing and recording well into his later years, including a notable reunion tour with Jabbo Smith in the 1970s.

Robinson's legacy is marked by his contributions to the development of jazz and blues banjo, his innovative approach to rhythm and phrasing, and his influence on subsequent generations of musicians. He appeared in the 1985 documentary film "Louie Bluie," which helped introduce his work to new audiences and highlighted his enduring impact on American music.
