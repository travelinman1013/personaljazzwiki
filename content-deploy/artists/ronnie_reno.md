## Biography
Ronnie Reno is an American bluegrass and country musician, singer, songwriter, bandleader, producer and television host, best known as the eldest son of bluegrass banjo pioneer Don Reno of the Hall of Fame duo Reno & Smiley.[1][5] Born into a deeply musical family rooted in early bluegrass, he started performing as a child; by 1955, at about seven years old, "Little Ronnie Reno" was standing on a milk carton to reach the microphone for his first national appearance on the Old Dominion Barn Dance, launching a professional career that would span more than six decades.[1][2][5] As a youngster he picked up the mandolin and joined his father’s band, appearing on Reno & Smiley’s influential recordings through the 1950s and 1960s while juggling school with television tapings and top-billed live dates, and he also worked as a versatile utility player with acts such as the Louvin Brothers.[1][2]

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Reno stepped out from his father’s shadow, joining the Osborne Brothers and contributing to their signature trio harmonies during their peak commercial years, including the period when they received the CMA Vocal Group of the Year award in 1971.[1][3] His strong traditional grounding and smooth vocal blend earned him the nickname **“Bluegrass Music’s Youngest Old-Timer,”** which helped attract the attention of country star Merle Haggard; Reno spent much of the 1970s and early 1980s in Haggard’s organization, harmonizing and playing guitar with Haggard and Bonnie Owens, appearing on around ten Haggard albums and on hits such as "If We Make It Through December," "If We’re Not Back in Love by Monday," and "Ramblin’ Fever," while also serving as Haggard’s opening act and contributing songs like "I’ve Got a Darlin’ for a Wife."[1][2][3] He further expanded his songwriting catalog with cuts for artists including Sammi Smith and Vassar Clements, and his composition "Boogie Grass Band" became a hit for Conway Twitty, underscoring his cross‑genre appeal between bluegrass and mainstream country.[1]

From the 1980s onward, Reno balanced performing with production and bandleading: after Don Reno’s death he joined his brothers in the Reno Brothers band, which earned an IBMA nomination in 1997, and he produced projects such as Merle Haggard’s "The Bluegrass Sessions," the chart‑topping "Kentucky Gold," and *Swing West*.[1][3] As a solo and band artist, he led Ronnie Reno & the Reno Tradition and released *Lessons Learned* in 2015 on Rural Rhythm Records, receiving positive critical attention including a "top pick" nod from the Washington Post.[1][3] Beyond the stage and studio, he became a prominent media ambassador for traditional music by creating and hosting the nationally broadcast television series "Reno’s Old Time Music Festival" (later "Reno’s Old Time Music"), the first and only national TV show devoted to bluegrass and acoustic music, seen in some 28 million households and earning a CableACE nomination and for Reno the moniker "The Dick Clark of Bluegrass."[1][2][3][6] In 2016 he was inducted into SPBGMA’s Preservation Hall of Greats, placing him alongside foundational figures such as Bill Monroe and Don Reno, and he has continued to work on preserving and remastering archival bluegrass performances, reinforcing his legacy as both a tradition‑bearer and a bridge between classic bluegrass and country audiences.[1]

## Fun Facts

- He earned the nickname “Bluegrass Music’s Youngest Old-Timer” because, despite his youth, he was already performing alongside first‑generation bluegrass legends and had logged years of professional experience by his teens.[1][6]
- Reno’s role as creator and host of “Reno’s Old Time Music Festival” made him such a fixture on bluegrass television that he was widely dubbed “The Dick Clark of Bluegrass Music.”[1][2][6]
- His songwriting cut “Boogie Grass Band” became a hit not in bluegrass but in mainstream country when recorded by Conway Twitty, illustrating how his bluegrass sensibility could cross over to a wider audience.[1]
