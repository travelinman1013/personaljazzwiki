## Biography
Squirrel Nut Zippers is a genre-blending band formed in 1993 in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, by Jimbo Mathus and his then-wife Katharine Whalen, joined by Tom Maxwell, Chris Phillips, Don Raleigh, and Ken Mosher. The group emerged as a creative response to the prevailing trends of modern rock, instead drawing from early jazz, swing, delta blues, and folk, with a quirky, theatrical flair. Their unique sound and energetic live shows quickly earned them a devoted following in the South and beyond.

The band’s breakthrough came with their 1996 album 'Hot,' which went platinum on the strength of the single 'Hell.' Their music, marked by a fusion of 1930s swing, gypsy jazz, klezmer, and blues, contributed significantly to the swing revival of the late 1990s. Squirrel Nut Zippers became known for their offbeat performances, media appearances (including Late Night with Conan O’Brien, Sesame Street, and Carnegie Hall with Tony Bennett), and a playful, irreverent approach to American roots music. Despite lineup changes and a period of waning commercial success in the early 2000s, the band has continued to tour and record, releasing new albums such as 'Beasts of Burgundy' (2018) and 'Lost Songs of Doc Souchon' (2020), and maintaining a legacy as true originals in the American music landscape.
