## Biography
Earl Rudolph "Bud" Powell was born on September 27, 1924, in New York City into a musically inclined family. He showed early musical promise, influenced by his father's stride piano style and the music of Fats Waller and Earl Hines. As a preteen, Powell transitioned from classical training to jazz, mastering James P. Johnson's "Carolina Shout" as his first jazz composition. At age fifteen, he began performing in New York, where he encountered key figures in the bebop movement, including his mentor Thelonious Monk, and became a regular participant in bebop sessions at Minton's Playhouse. Powell's early performances and recordings with Cootie Williams in 1943 and 1944 established him as an up-and-coming pianist.

During the late 1940s to early 1950s, Powell produced a series of groundbreaking recordings that established him as the leading jazz pianist of the era. Beginning in 1947, he formed his own groups, primarily trios with bass and drums, and recorded extensively with major figures including Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, and Miles Davis. His compositions from this period, including "Parisian Thoroughfare" and "Un Poco Loco" (recorded in 1951 for Blue Note), became jazz standards and were later recognized by literary critic Harold Bloom as among the greatest works of 20th-century American art. Powell's innovative right-hand lines and distinctive trio arrangements fundamentally transformed jazz piano, moving away from the two-handed stride style of earlier pianists.

Despite his groundbreaking musical contributions, Powell struggled significantly with mental health issues and alcoholism throughout his career, which impacted his consistency and output. After periods of mental instability beginning in 1953, he moved to Paris in 1959, where he found a more welcoming environment and continued to record and perform with fellow expatriate musicians. Following a triumphant return engagement at Birdland in 1964, where critic Dan Morgenstern noted he remained "a creative jazzman and pianist of the first rank," Powell passed away on July 31, 1966, in New York City. His legacy fundamentally reshaped the role of the pianist in jazz ensembles, with his deconstruction of traditional piano voicing paving the way for future generations of musicians including Bill Evans and Red Garland.
