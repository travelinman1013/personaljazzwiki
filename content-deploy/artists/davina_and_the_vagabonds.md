## Biography
Davina & The Vagabonds is a jazz-blues band founded in 2004 by frontwoman Davina Sowers in the Twin Cities, Minnesota. Sowers, who grew up in Altoona, Pennsylvania, was exposed to a wide array of music through her family—her mother was a folk singer and her much-older stepfather introduced her to pre-war jazz and blues via his Edison phonograph. Despite a turbulent adolescence marked by homelessness and addiction, Sowers found her footing in Minneapolis, where she formed the band and began performing both covers and original compositions rooted in American roots music.[1][4]

The band’s music is a vibrant blend of blues, jazz, roots, Americana, and swing, characterized by Sowers’ powerful vocals and boogie-woogie piano, supported by a horn-driven ensemble. Their sound draws comparisons to early-20th-century jazz and blues but is refreshed by Sowers’ modern sensibility and stage presence. Albums like 'Black Cloud' (2011) and 'Sunshine' (2014) earned critical acclaim, with the latter reaching number 13 on the Billboard Blues Chart. The group is celebrated for their energetic live shows and has performed at major festivals across the US and Europe, including the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival and the North Sea Jazz Festival.[1][2]

Davina & The Vagabonds have carved a unique niche in the contemporary blues and jazz scene, blending influences from Fats Domino to Led Zeppelin, and are known for their sharp-dressed professionalism and dynamic performances. Their legacy is one of resilience, musical innovation, and a commitment to keeping the spirit of American roots music alive for new generations.[1][2][3]
