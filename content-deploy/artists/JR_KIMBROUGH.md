## Biography
David "Junior" Kimbrough was born on July 28, 1930, in Hudsonville, Mississippi, and lived in the North Mississippi Hill Country near Holly Springs. His father was a barber who played guitar, and Junior picked up the instrument as a child. He was influenced early on by guitarists Lightnin' Hopkins, Mississippi Fred McDowell, and Eli Green. In the late 1950s, Kimbrough began developing his distinctive style, characterized by mid-tempo rhythms and a steady drone played with his thumb on the bass strings, which would later be recognized as a prime example of hill country blues.

Kimbrough's music was marked by tricky syncopations between his droning bass strings and midrange melodies, with a modal soloing style featuring languorous runs in the middle and upper registers. Music critic Robert Palmer described the result as "hypnotic," and the polyrhythmic nature of his work linked it explicitly to African musical traditions. After years of performing in juke joints and house parties throughout the Mississippi hills, Kimbrough gained national attention in 1992 with his debut album "All Night Long," produced by Robert Palmer for Fat Possum Records. He operated several juke joints, including the Chewalla Rib Shack (opened in 1990) and Junior's Place in Chulahoma near Holly Springs, where visitors from around the world came to experience his unique brand of "cotton patch blues."

Kimbrough's career flourished in the 1990s with additional albums including "Sad Days, Lonely Nights" (1994) and "Most Things Haven't Worked Out" (1997). He died of a heart attack following a stroke on January 17, 1998, in Holly Springs at age 67. His influence extended far beyond traditional blues, inspiring alternative rock and trance music devotees. The rockabilly musician Charlie Feathers called him "the beginning and end of all music," a tribute that appears on Kimbrough's tombstone outside the Kimbrough Chapel Missionary Baptist Church near Holly Springs.
