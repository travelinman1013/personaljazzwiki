## Biography
Ruby Johnson (April 19, 1936 – July 4, 1999) was an American soul singer celebrated for her powerful contralto voice and her recordings on the Volt label in the late 1960s. Born in Elizabeth City, North Carolina, and raised in the Jewish faith, she sang in the Temple Beth-El choir alongside her eight siblings. After high school, Johnson moved to Virginia Beach, working as a waitress while performing rhythm and blues with local bands, notably spending two years with Samuel Latham and the Rhythm Makers. Her career took a significant turn when she relocated to Washington, D.C., in the late 1950s, joining Ambrose and the Showstoppers, the house band at the Spa nightclub.

Johnson's recording career began in 1960 with the single "Calling All Boys" on the V-Tone label, followed by a series of regional hits on NEBS Records. Her big break came when disc jockey Al Bell, a supporter from her Washington days, secured her a contract with Stax Records in Memphis in 1965. At Stax, she recorded several classic soul tracks with the renowned writing and production team of Isaac Hayes and David Porter, and was backed by members of Booker T. & the MG's. Her song "I'll Run Your Hurt Away" reached No. 31 on the Billboard R&B chart in 1966, and her recordings became staples of later soul compilations. Despite her talent, commercial success eluded her, and she retired from music in 1974, later dedicating herself to public service and community work in Maryland.

Johnson's musical style was marked by deep emotional expression and a classic soul sound, blending elements of R&B with the Memphis soul tradition. Though she did not achieve widespread fame during her lifetime, her work has been rediscovered by soul aficionados, and her recordings are now regarded as essential listening for fans of classic soul and northern soul.
