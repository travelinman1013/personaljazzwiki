## Biography
David Bowie, born David Robert Jones on January 8, 1947, in Brixton, London, emerged as one of the most influential and innovative figures in 20th-century music. Raised in south London, Bowie developed an early passion for music, inspired by American rock and jazz, and began playing saxophone at age 13. His half-brother Terry Burns introduced him to modern jazz and beat literature, which profoundly shaped his artistic outlook. Bowie started his professional music career in the early 1960s, performing with various bands such as The King Bees and The Lower Third, before adopting the stage name David Bowie in 1966 to avoid confusion with Davy Jones of The Monkees. His first solo album in 1967 failed to make a commercial impact, but the 1969 release of 'Space Oddity' marked his breakthrough, reaching the UK top five and establishing his reputation as a bold new voice in British pop.[2][3][4]

The 1970s saw Bowie’s meteoric rise, beginning with the critically acclaimed albums 'The Man Who Sold the World' (1970) and 'Hunky Dory' (1971). His 1972 creation of the flamboyant alter ego Ziggy Stardust, showcased on 'The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars,' propelled him to global stardom and defined the glam rock era. Bowie was renowned for his constant reinvention, shifting from glam rock to 'plastic soul' with 'Young Americans' (1975), which featured his first US number-one single 'Fame' (co-written with John Lennon). The late 1970s 'Berlin Trilogy'—'Low,' 'Heroes,' and 'Lodger'—saw Bowie collaborating with Brian Eno and exploring electronic and experimental sounds, further cementing his reputation as a musical innovator.[2][4]

Bowie’s legacy is defined by his fearless experimentation, theatrical stagecraft, and ability to anticipate and shape musical trends. His influence spans genres from glam rock and soul to electronic and art rock, and his visual presentation and alter egos, such as Ziggy Stardust and the Thin White Duke, have left a lasting mark on popular culture. With estimated record sales of over 140 million worldwide, Bowie is celebrated as a pioneer whose work continues to inspire generations of musicians and artists.[2][4]
