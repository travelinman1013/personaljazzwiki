## Biography
Julian Lage is an award-winning guitarist hailed as one of the most prodigious musicians of his generation.[1][2] Born in California and now based in New York, Lage demonstrated extraordinary talent from an early age, beginning guitar at five years old and performing publicly by age six.[1] His precocious abilities led to performances with renowned artists including Carlos Santana at age eight, Pat Metheny, Kenny Werner, and David Grisman, making him the subject of the Academy Award-nominated 1996 documentary film Jules at Eight.[1] His early career was shaped by mentors including Randy Vincent (six hours weekly instruction from ages 8-12), David Grisman, and notably Gary Burton, whose attention was captured by Lage's performance on the 2000 Grammy Awards telecast.[3]

Throughout his career, Lage has established himself as both a versatile sideman and accomplished bandleader, working across jazz, classical, pop, and American musical traditions.[1] His solo discography includes Sounding Point (2009, nominated for Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Jazz Album), Gladwell (2011), Free Flying (2013), Room (2014) as a duo with Nels Cline, Arclight (2016), Modern Lore (2018), Love Hurts, and his Blue Note Records debut Squint.[1][2][4] Beyond leading his own projects, Lage has collaborated extensively with figures including Nels Cline, Fred Hersch, Chris Eldridge, Eric Harland, John Zorn, and Gary Burton across multiple albums and performances.[1][2]

Lage's musical approach is characterized by impeccable technique combined with a gift for free association between styles, tempos, keys, and textures.[1] He draws inspiration from diverse sources—Gypsy jazz, bluegrass, European and Indian classical music, and the American song catalog—performing works ranging from Roy Orbison to Ornette Coleman.[2][3] Despite facing a career-threatening hand injury in 2013 while writing solo acoustic material, Lage has continued to develop his distinctive sound, which blends jazz fusion, standards interpretation, and embryonic rock and roll with adventurous improvisation and virtuosic precision.[2][3]
