## Biography
Morton's Red Hot Peppers was a groundbreaking jazz ensemble led by pianist, composer, and arranger Jelly Roll Morton from 1926 to 1930. Formed in Chicago, the group brought together some of the finest New Orleans-style freelance musicians of the era, including cornetist George Mitchell, trombonist Kid Ory, clarinetists Omer Simeon and Johnny Dodds, banjoists Johnny St. Cyr and Bud Scott, bassist John Lindsay, and drummers Andrew Hilaire and Baby Dodds. The band was primarily a recording group, producing influential sides for Victor Records that set a new standard for small group jazz with their blend of written arrangements and improvisation.[1][3]

The Red Hot Peppers' recordings, such as 'Black Bottom Stomp,' 'Smoke-House Blues,' and 'Doctor Jazz,' are still celebrated for their clarity, variety, and balance between ensemble and solo playing. Morton's meticulous approach to rehearsal and his innovative arrangements—featuring dynamic shifts, stop-time figures, and rhythmic complexity—distinguished the group from contemporaries and showcased the full expressive range of early jazz. After moving to New York in 1928, Morton continued recording under the Red Hot Peppers name with a changing roster until the group name was retired in 1930.[1][3]

The legacy of Morton's Red Hot Peppers is immense: their recordings are considered some of the finest examples of the 'hot style' in jazz, and their influence persists in the genre's development. Morton's leadership and compositional genius helped elevate jazz from its roots in New Orleans dance halls to a sophisticated art form, and the Red Hot Peppers remain a touchstone for jazz historians and musicians alike.[1][2][3]
