## Biography
Magdalena Bay is an American alternative pop duo formed by Mica Tenenbaum and Matthew Lewin, both originally from Miami, Florida. Their musical partnership began in high school, where they played together in a classic rock covers band and later formed the progressive rock group Tabula Rasa in 2011. After Tabula Rasa disbanded due to college relocations, Tenenbaum and Lewin continued collaborating long-distance while attending college in Boston and Philadelphia, respectively. In 2016, they officially launched Magdalena Bay, shifting their focus from prog-rock to synth-driven, artful pop music.

The duo's sound is characterized by catchy melodies, lush synth textures, and playful yet sophisticated production, drawing inspiration from artists like Grimes, Chairlift, and Charli XCX. Magdalena Bay released their first EPs, 'Day/Pop' and 'Night/Pop', in 2019, followed by a series of mixtapes and their acclaimed debut album 'Mercurial World' in 2021. Their music often blends retro and futuristic elements, with nods to their prog-rock roots and a knack for crafting infectious pop hooks. The band has performed at major festivals including Coachella, Lollapalooza, and Primavera Sound, steadily building a reputation for their inventive approach to pop and immersive live shows.

Magdalena Bay is recognized for their DIY ethos, producing their own music and visuals, and engaging fans through interactive online experiences. Their legacy lies in their ability to merge experimental pop sensibilities with accessible songwriting, making them influential figures in the current wave of art pop and synthpop.
