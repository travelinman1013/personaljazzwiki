## Biography
Dave & James Blake is not a formal duo or band, but rather a high-profile musical collaboration between two acclaimed British artists: Dave (David Orobosa Omoregie), a South London rapper and songwriter, and James Blake, an English singer, songwriter, and producer. Their collaboration is most notably featured on Dave’s 2025 album 'The Boy Who Played The Harp,' which includes a track titled 'History' that has garnered significant attention for its introspective lyricism and innovative production.[3][4][5]

James Blake, born in London in 1988, is renowned for his emotive vocals, genre-blending production, and experimental approach to music. He first gained recognition in the early 2010s with a series of influential EPs and his self-titled debut album, and has since become a sought-after collaborator for artists across hip-hop, R&B, and electronic music.[1][2] Dave, meanwhile, has established himself as one of the UK’s most insightful and lyrically gifted rappers, known for his storytelling and social commentary. Their collaboration merges Dave’s incisive lyricism with Blake’s atmospheric and soulful soundscapes, resulting in music that is both deeply personal and sonically adventurous.

The partnership between Dave and James Blake is emblematic of the current era of British music, where genre boundaries are increasingly fluid. While their joint work is relatively recent, it has already been praised for its emotional depth and creative synergy, highlighting both artists’ willingness to push artistic boundaries and address profound themes.
