## Biography
John Paul Pizzarelli was born on April 6, 1960, in Paterson, New Jersey, into a family deeply rooted in musical tradition. His father, John "Bucky" Pizzarelli, was an acclaimed jazz guitarist who played on legendary recordings by Ray Charles and Frank Sinatra, while his musical uncles Pete and Bobby Domenick provided early guidance. Growing up in this rich musical environment, John was naturally drawn to the guitar, though his early musical journey was eclectic—he initially pursued rock and roll, playing in bands like Emanon and Johnny Pick and His Scabs while attending William Paterson University. A transformative moment came in the summer of 1981 when, driving home from Manhattan on Route 17, John heard a João Gilberto song on the radio that fundamentally changed his artistic direction and inspired him to pursue jazz seriously.

John Pizzarelli's professional career took flight in the early 1980s after he dropped out of college to become a full-time musician. He recorded his debut album as a vocalist, "I'm Hip (Please Don't Tell My Father)," in 1983, featuring his father's trio, and followed with "Swinging Sevens" (1984) and "Hit That Jive, Jack!" His early collaborations with his father and bassist brother Martin Pizzarelli established him as a rising talent in the jazz world. Throughout the 1990s and beyond, Pizzarelli evolved into a Grammy Award-winning artist and premier interpreter of the Great American Songbook, known for his innovative arrangements of jazz standards and his ability to reimagine works by contemporary artists including Paul McCartney, Joni Mitchell, Neil Young, and the Beatles. The Boston Globe praised him for "reinvigorating the Great American Songbook and re-popularizing jazz."

Beyond his recording career, Pizzarelli has become one of America's most recognizable jazz artists through his work as a bandleader, vocalist, television performer, and radio host. He co-hosts "Radio Deluxe with John Pizzarelli," a nationally syndicated radio program with his wife, Broadway star Jessica Molaskey. His career demonstrates a unique ability to honor jazz tradition while expanding its boundaries, making him a consummate entertainer who bridges the gap between classic standards and contemporary music.

## Fun Facts
- John's father Bucky jokingly claimed he was "the only guy playing jazz to support his rock and roll habit," referring to his dual musical interests—a philosophy John initially shared before his transformative moment in 1981.
- During a 1980 performance with his father and Zoot Sims, two men suddenly started fighting backstage just as Bucky and Zoot were teaching John last-minute chords for "Ghost of a Chance," giving him an early taste of the unpredictable nature of showbiz.
- John's sister Mary, then 15 years old, was invited by their father Bucky to play guitar on two of his albums, including the acclaimed "Green Guitar Blues," showing how the entire Pizzarelli family was immersed in music.
- Peter Frampton's 1976 mega-selling album "Frampton Comes Alive" made a significant impression on John and helped steer him toward a career in jazz, despite his earlier rock and roll pursuits.
