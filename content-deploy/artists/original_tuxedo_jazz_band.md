## Biography
The Original Tuxedo Jazz Band is one of the most storied and enduring ensembles in the history of New Orleans jazz. Founded in 1910 by cornetist Oscar 'Papa' Celestin, the band took its name from the Tuxedo Dance Hall in Storyville, New Orleans' famed red-light district. Celestin led the group through the formative decades of jazz, establishing it as a cornerstone of the city's musical culture. The band's early years were marked by performances at dances, parades, and funerals, embodying the classic New Orleans jazz tradition with a lineup that included some of the era's most influential musicians.

After Celestin's death in 1954, leadership passed to banjoist and guitarist Albert 'Papa' French, who continued to uphold the band's reputation for excellence and authenticity. Under French and subsequent leaders, including his grandson Gerald French, the band has maintained its commitment to the traditional New Orleans sound, blending spirited ensemble playing with individual improvisation. The Original Tuxedo Jazz Band became the first jazz band to perform at the White House in 1953, a testament to its national significance and enduring appeal. Today, it stands as the world’s longest continually functioning jazz band, a living link to the origins of jazz and a vital force in preserving its legacy.[3][2][6]
