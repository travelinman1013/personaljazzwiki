## Quick Info

- **Origin**: Denton

## Biography
Brave Combo is a polka rock band founded in 1979 in Denton, Texas, by guitarist/keyboardist/accordionist Carl Finch alongside fellow North Texas State University (now UNT) students Lyle Atkinson, Tim Walsh, and Dave “Tito” Cameron (later Lisa Cameron after gender transition). Emerging as a rebellion against the disco-dominated and increasingly corporate rock scene, the band developed their signature 'nuclear polka' style, blending polka with rock energy, Latin American rhythms like salsa, cumbia, and cha-cha-cha, and covers of mainstream songs reimagined in polka or other ethnic formats, such as Jimi Hendrix's 'Purple Haze' and the Rolling Stones' '(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction' as a cha-cha.[1][2]

Quickly gaining traction as a wedding band in North Texas, Brave Combo turned professional after their first summer of gigs, touring regionally and making pivotal leaps like their 1980 New York debut offered by early supporter Joe Nick Patoski. Key lineup changes included Walsh's departure in 1983 and Atkinson's intermittent tenure (1979-1985, returning 2015), with Jeffrey Barnes joining in 1983 on multiple winds. Finch has remained the sole constant member, driving the band's DIY ethic and eclectic output over four decades.[1][2]

The band's legacy includes two Grammy Awards for Best Polka Album ('Polkasonic' in 1999 and 'Let's Kiss' in 2004), media appearances like cameos in David Byrne's 1986 film 'True Stories' (where they also served as his wedding band) and an animated spot on 'The Simpsons' at Matt Groening's request, plus compositions for TV themes. Cited as the 'Grand Pooh-Bah of Denton bands' by Paste magazine, Brave Combo has influenced the local scene's ambitious, genre-blending ethos.[1][2]

## Fun Facts
- Brave Combo served as David Byrne's real-life wedding band and appeared in his 1986 film 'True Stories,' with Finch leading an all-accordion marching band in the parade scene.[1][2]
- They made an animated cameo on 'The Simpsons' in 2004 at Matt Groening's request, performing original song 'Fill The Stein' and their version of the theme over credits.[2]
- The band started as a wedding band, quickly making enough money in their first summer of 1979 for most members to quit day jobs.[1]
- Their song 'Busy Office Rhumba' was the theme for the 1993 Fox series 'Bakersfield P.D.,' and Carl Finch composed music for PBS's 2008 'Click and Clack's As the Wrench Turns.'[2]
