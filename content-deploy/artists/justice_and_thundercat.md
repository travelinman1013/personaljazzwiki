## Biography
Justice & Thundercat is a collaboration between the French electronic band Justice and American bassist Stephen Lee Bruner (Thundercat). Rather than a permanent musical partnership, this represents a notable one-off collaboration that emerged in 2024. Thundercat, born October 19, 1984, in Los Angeles, California, is a virtuosic bassist and singer who has become one of the most sought-after session musicians in contemporary music. He began playing bass at age 4 and was inspired by legendary bassists like Stanley Clarke, Marcus Miller, and Jaco Pastorius. His career spans multiple genres including funk, soul, progressive R&B, jazz-fusion, and metal, having initially gained prominence as a member of crossover thrash band Suicidal Tendencies before transitioning to a more eclectic solo career. In 2024, Thundercat collaborated with Justice on the track "The End," which appeared as the final track on Justice's album *Hyperdrama*, released on April 26, 2024. This collaboration represented a significant moment in both artists' careers, as the song was subsequently featured at the Summer Olympics 2024 closing ceremony in Paris, bringing Thundercat's virtuosic bass work to a global audience of millions.

## Fun Facts
- Thundercat found his stage name as a reference to the cartoon character he loved since childhood, reflecting his wide-eyed and vibrant approach to music that he describes as 'often superhuman.'
- In August 2024, Thundercat appeared on the children's show Yo Gabba Gabba performing "Orange Cat" in full costume, and reunited with the cast in December 2024 for a medley performance as part of the Tiny Desk Concert series.
- His father, Ronald Bruner Sr., was a drummer who played with the Temptations, making music a family legacy; Thundercat began playing bass at just 4 years old, making him a 'late-bloomer' compared to his father's early start.
- By age 15, Thundercat had already achieved a minor hit in Germany as a member of the boy band No Curfew, demonstrating his prodigious talent from an early age.
