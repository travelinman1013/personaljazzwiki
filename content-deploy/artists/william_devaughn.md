## Biography
William DeVaughn, born on November 28, 1947, in Washington, D.C., learned to play piano by observing musicians at the East Capitol Recreation Center and was influenced by Curtis Mayfield and the Impressions, leading him to form a short-lived trio called the Dacrons with Steve Wade and Leon MacManus.[2][3] Working as a salaried government employee as a drafting technician while being a part-time singer and devout Jehovah's Witness, DeVaughn wrote 'A Cadillac Don’t Come Easy,' later revised into his breakthrough hit 'Be Thankful for What You Got' in 1972, investing $900 to record it with producers Frank Fioravanti and John Davis at Sigma Sound Studios using MFSB session musicians including Norman Harris, Earl Young, Ron Baker, and Vince Montana.[1][2][3]

The 1974 release of 'Be Thankful for What You Got' topped the R&B charts and reached #4 on the Billboard Hot 100, selling nearly two million copies and propelling DeVaughn to tour nationally while he took a leave from his job, though he remained humble, using public transportation.[2][3] Follow-up singles like 'Blood Is Thicker Than Water' and 'Give the Little Man a Great Big Hand' achieved moderate success, but his religious convictions limited further recordings to just three albums, leading him to return to drafting and work at a record store.[1][2] His smooth soul style, characterized by soft vocals, sentimental lyrics on love, sorrow, redemption, and positivity, blended Philly soul elements with gospel influences.[1][5]

DeVaughn's legacy endures through samples by artists like N.W.A., Ice Cube, Yo Gotti, Ludacris, and De La Soul, and covers by Massive Attack and others, with later releases including the 2008 album 'Time Will Stand Still' and 2017's 'The Overlooked Songs' on his Mighty Two Diamond Records, while he mentors new artists on the music business.[1][2][3]

## Fun Facts
- DeVaughn designed sewers as a government drafting technician before his hit and returned to the job after success due to his Jehovah's Witness faith, which limited his recordings to only three albums.[2]
- He self-financed his breakthrough recording for $900 and rode public transportation even during national tours to stay humble.[3]
- His debut single was played on gospel radio stations due to its positive, encouraging lyrics despite being secular soul.[2]
- Post-fame, he worked at Harmony Hut record store in Iverson Mall to learn the music business from another angle.[3]
