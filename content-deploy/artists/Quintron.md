## Biography
Quintron, born Robert Rolston around 1967 in Germany, is an innovative American musician, inventor, and one-man-band who has become a fixture of New Orleans' vibrant underground scene[1][6]. Raised in St. Louis and Mobile, Alabama, Quintron attended Loyola University and later DePaul University, where he was active in the theatre department and began experimenting with music and performance art[1]. His early career included stints in Chicago's experimental trio MATH and running the Milk of Burgundy club, before relocating to New Orleans in 1991, where he established his own venue, the Spellcaster Lodge[1][6].

Quintron is renowned for his genre-defying sound, blending elements of R&B, dance, experimental noise, and swamp-tech. His performances are marked by the use of custom-built instruments, most notably the Drum Buddy—a patented, light-activated analog drum machine—and the Weather Warlock, a synthesizer controlled by environmental conditions[1][3][5]. He often performs alongside his wife and creative partner, Miss Pussycat (Panacea Theriac), whose puppet shows and maraca playing add a psychedelic, theatrical dimension to their live shows[1][2][4]. Their collaborative work has toured globally, combining Quintron's raw organ-driven party music with Miss Pussycat's surreal puppetry.

Quintron's legacy lies in his relentless creativity and DIY ethos, which have inspired a revival of analog synth experimentation and live performance innovation. His music and inventions have influenced a wide range of artists, and his club, Spellcaster Lodge, became a hub for New Orleans' avant-garde community. Despite setbacks such as Hurricane Katrina, Quintron has continued to invent, perform, and push the boundaries of electronic and experimental music[1][3][4].
