## Biography
Mario Ulloa e Daniel Guedes are a duo known for their unique blend of Brazilian jazz, classical, and popular music, featuring Ulloa on guitar and Guedes on violin and viola. Daniel Guedes, born in Rio de Janeiro in 1977, began studying violin at age seven with his father, an amateur violinist, and quickly entered the Brazilian Conservatory of Music. By age ten, he was already performing as a soloist with major Brazilian orchestras. He later studied at the Guildhall School of Music in London and earned both bachelor’s and master’s degrees at the Manhattan School of Music in New York, where he studied under renowned musicians Pinchas Zukerman and Patinka Kopec[1][2]. Guedes has performed internationally, including at Carnegie Hall, and is recognized as one of Brazil’s leading musicians of his generation, serving as a professor at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro and artistic director of several music festivals[1][2]. Mario Ulloa, a Costa Rican guitarist, is less documented in English-language sources, but is recognized for his collaborations with Guedes and other prominent musicians. Together, Ulloa and Guedes have developed a repertoire that spans bossa nova, samba, choro, bolero, and classical works, reflecting both artists’ deep roots in Latin American music traditions and their classical training[1]. Their partnership is notable for bridging the worlds of classical chamber music and Brazilian popular genres, creating a distinctive sound that appeals to both jazz and classical audiences.
