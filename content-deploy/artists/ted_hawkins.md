## Biography
Ted Hawkins (October 28, 1936 – January 1, 1995) was an American singer-songwriter whose life and music were shaped by hardship and resilience. Born in Biloxi, Mississippi, to a mother who was a prostitute and a father he never knew, Hawkins endured poverty and abuse from an early age. By age 12, he was sent to reform school, where a visit from New Orleans pianist Professor Longhair inspired his first public performance. Despite these early musical sparks, Hawkins spent much of his youth drifting across the country, often in trouble with the law, including a three-year stint at Mississippi's notorious Parchman Farm for stealing a leather jacket as a teenager.[5][1][3]

Hawkins developed his distinctive blend of soul, blues, folk, gospel, and country while busking on the streets and piers of Venice Beach, California. His powerful, raspy voice—shaped by years of singing outdoors—earned him a devoted local following and, eventually, recognition in Europe and Australia, where he found greater appreciation in clubs and small concert halls. His first album, 'Watch Your Step' (1982), was produced by Bruce Bromberg after years of sporadic recording and personal setbacks. Hawkins' major breakthrough came late in life with the release of 'The Next Hundred Years' (1994) on Geffen Records, which brought him international acclaim. Tragically, he died of a stroke just months later, at the cusp of wider stardom.[5][3][4]

Hawkins' musical style was marked by his emotive vocals and open guitar tunings, drawing from the deep well of American roots music. His legacy endures as a testament to the power of perseverance and the enduring appeal of heartfelt, honest songwriting.[2][8]

## Fun Facts
- Hawkins spent years performing as a street musician on Venice Beach, often sitting on an overturned milk crate and captivating passersby with his soulful voice.[2][4]
- He claimed his signature raspy vocal tone was the result of years singing in the sand and salt air of the boardwalk.[2][5]
- Despite his eventual acclaim in Europe and Australia, Hawkins remained largely unknown in the U.S. until his final album was released months before his death.[3][5]
- Hawkins' life story—marked by prison, addiction, and redemption—was often reflected in the raw honesty of his lyrics and performances.[3][5]
