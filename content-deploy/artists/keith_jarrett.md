## Biography
Keith Jarrett, born May 8, 1945, in Allentown, Pennsylvania, is widely regarded as one of the most inventive and influential jazz pianists of the late 20th and early 21st centuries. A child prodigy, Jarrett began playing piano at age three and gave his first formal recital at seven, blending classical repertoire with his own compositions. His early exposure to both classical and jazz traditions shaped a career marked by technical virtuosity and a unique improvisational voice.[1][2][3][4]

After brief studies at Berklee College of Music, Jarrett moved to New York in the mid-1960s, where he quickly became a sought-after sideman. He played with Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers and rose to prominence in the Charles Lloyd Quartet, which gained international acclaim for its innovative blend of jazz and world music influences. Jarrett's tenure with Miles Davis in the early 1970s, during Davis's electric period, further expanded his musical horizons, despite Jarrett's personal aversion to electronic keyboards.[1][2][3]

Jarrett is perhaps best known for his solo piano improvisation concerts, most notably 'The Köln Concert' (1975), which remains one of the best-selling solo piano albums ever recorded. He has also led acclaimed ensembles, including his American Quartet and the long-running Standards Trio with Gary Peacock and Jack DeJohnette. Jarrett's work spans jazz, classical, and experimental genres, and his emotionally charged, physically expressive performance style has left a lasting legacy. Despite health setbacks, including chronic fatigue syndrome and strokes, Jarrett's influence endures through his recordings and the generations of musicians he has inspired.[2][3][6]
