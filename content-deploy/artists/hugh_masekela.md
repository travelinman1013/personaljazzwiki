## Biography
Hugh Ramapolo Masekela (1939–2018) was born in Witbank, South Africa, and became one of the most influential figures in South African music. As a child, he sang and played piano, but his musical trajectory changed at age 14 when anti-apartheid activist Trevor Huddleston gifted him his first trumpet, inspiring him to pursue jazz[2][3][5]. Masekela quickly mastered the instrument, forming the Huddleston Jazz Band, South Africa’s first youth orchestra, and later joining the African Jazz Revue and the orchestra for the landmark musical 'King Kong,' where he met his future wife, Miriam Makeba[1][2][4].

Masekela’s career developed amidst the political turmoil of apartheid, and his music became a vehicle for protest and cultural expression. After the Sharpeville massacre and tightening apartheid restrictions, he emigrated to the United States in 1960, studying at the Manhattan School of Music. There, he absorbed American jazz influences and collaborated with global artists, blending South African township sounds, kwela, and Afrobeat with jazz and soul[3][5]. His international breakthrough came with the 1968 hit "Grazing in the Grass," and he continued to champion African music through collaborations with artists like Fela Kuti and Paul Simon, notably joining Simon’s "Graceland" tour[3][5].

Masekela’s legacy is defined by his role as the "father of South African jazz" and his outspoken opposition to apartheid. His compositions, such as "Soweto Blues" and "Bring Him Back Home," became anthems of resistance, and his influence extended across continents, inspiring generations of musicians. He returned to South Africa after the end of apartheid, continuing to record, perform, and mentor young artists until his death in 2018[3][5].
