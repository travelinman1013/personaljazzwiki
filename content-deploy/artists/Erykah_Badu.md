## Biography
Erykah Badu, born Erica Abi Wright on February 26, 1971, in Dallas, Texas, is a pioneering American singer-songwriter, producer, and actress renowned for her role in the development of neo soul. Raised by her mother, an actress, Badu was immersed in the arts from a young age, performing at the Dallas Theater Center and freestyling on local radio by her early teens. She attended Booker T. Washington High School for the Performing and Visual Arts, then studied theater and minored in quantum physics at Grambling State University before leaving to pursue music full-time. 

Badu's career began in earnest after she formed the group Erykah Free with her cousin, performing locally and recording demos. Her breakthrough came in 1996 when producer Kedar Massenburg signed her, leading to a duet with D'Angelo and the release of her debut album, 'Baduizm,' in 1997. The album, blending traditional soul vocals with hip-hop rhythms and jazz influences, was a critical and commercial success, earning her two Grammy Awards and establishing her as a leading voice in neo soul. Badu's subsequent work has continued to explore themes of spirituality, identity, and social consciousness, marked by her distinctive vocal style and eclectic musical influences.

Over the years, Badu has become an influential figure in contemporary R&B and soul, often compared to jazz legend Billie Holiday for her vocal timbre and emotional depth. Her legacy extends beyond music into activism, holistic wellness, and mentorship, cementing her status as a cultural icon whose impact resonates with artists and audiences worldwide.
