## Biography
David “Fathead” Newman (February 24, 1933 – January 20, 2009) was an American saxophonist and flutist whose warm tone and concise, soulful phrasing helped define the sound of mid‑century rhythm and blues and soul jazz, especially through his long association with Ray Charles.[3][4] Born in Corsicana and raised in Dallas, Texas, he studied piano and alto saxophone at Lincoln High School and later attended Jarvis Christian College, while also coming under the influence of local bandleader and saxophonist Buster Smith, a key mentor in the Dallas scene.[1][4] Newman initially gravitated toward bebop, working in regional bands and backing blues artists such as T‑Bone Walker, before a 1951 encounter with Ray Charles—then a pianist and singer with the Lowell Fulson band—set the course of his career.[2][3][4]

Newman joined Charles’s own band in 1954, first on baritone saxophone and soon switching to tenor, becoming the principal saxophone soloist after Don Wilkerson’s departure.[3][4] His brief but unforgettable tenor lines on early Ray Charles hits such as “The Right Time,” “Unchain My Heart,” “What’d I Say,” and “Lonely Avenue” were later described as “crucial to the Ray Charles sound,” and Atlantic producer Jerry Wexler called him Charles’s “alter ego on tenor.”[2][3][5] Charles produced and played piano on Newman’s debut as a leader, *Fathead: Ray Charles Presents David Newman* (1959), whose version of “Hard Times” became Newman’s signature tune and a favorite radio theme.[1][3][4][5] After leaving Charles’s band in the mid‑1960s (with a brief return around 1970–71), Newman built a substantial career as a leader and in-demand session player, recording roughly 40 albums under his own name and working with artists including Herbie Mann, Aretha Franklin, B.B. King, Nat King Cole, Donny Hathaway, Dr. John, Eric Clapton, and others.[1][4] In the 1970s he co-led Herbie Mann’s band for about a decade, then focused increasingly on solo projects that blended hard bop, bebop, and soul jazz with blues and balladry.[4][5]

Stylistically, Newman was known for a robust yet lyrical tenor sound, an economical approach to soloing, and an ability to move seamlessly between jazz, blues, R&B, and pop—a versatility he attributed in part to Charles’s “lesson in music appreciation,” which broadened his horizons beyond bebop to “respect and admire and love all other forms of music.”[5] His later recordings often revisited the musical spirit of his earlier years, including the acclaimed tribute *I Remember Brother Ray* (2005), which topped U.S. jazz radio play charts and renewed attention to his role in Charles’s legacy.[4] Frequently described as a “musician’s musician,” Newman remained active in performance and recording into the 2000s, and he was even portrayed (and featured musically) in the Ray Charles biopic *Ray* (2004), underscoring his enduring association with the singer.[4] He died in Kingston, New York, in 2009 at age 75, leaving behind a legacy as one of the most distinctive saxophone voices in modern American music and an essential architect of Ray Charles’s classic sound.[1][3][4]

## Fun Facts
- Newman received the nickname “Fathead” in high school; accounts often trace it to a teacher scolding him for memorizing a music part instead of reading the chart, calling him a “fathead.”[3][4]
- His friendship with Ray Charles was cemented after the two were arrested together in Houston in 1952; spending the night in jail deepened their bond and preceded Newman’s joining Charles’s band two years later.[4][5]
- Although famous for tenor sax, Newman initially joined Ray Charles’s band on baritone sax because that was the only chair available, only later switching to tenor and becoming the featured soloist.[2][3][4]
- Newman’s tribute album *I Remember Brother Ray* (2005), honoring Ray Charles, became the number‑one most played jazz album nationwide on U.S. jazz radio, decades after their original collaborations.[4]
