## Biography
Alvin 'Red' Tyler (born December 5, 1925, in New Orleans, Louisiana; died April 3, 1998) was a pivotal saxophonist, arranger, bandleader, and producer whose work helped define the sound of New Orleans rhythm and blues and early rock 'n' roll. Raised in the 9th Ward, Tyler's early musical exposure came from attending local dances and absorbing the vibrant sounds of his city, but he did not begin playing music until after serving in the Navy during World War II. Using the G.I. Bill, he studied at the Grunewald School of Music, starting his professional career as an adult—a rare path among his peers.[1][6][4]

Tyler's career took off in 1949 when he joined Dave Bartholomew's orchestra, soon becoming a core member of the legendary J&M Studio Band at Cosimo Matassa’s studio. His baritone and tenor saxophone work can be heard on countless hits by Fats Domino, Little Richard, Lloyd Price, and many others, making him a key architect of the New Orleans R&B sound. Tyler was not only a session player but often served as de facto arranger and producer, crafting the signature 'head' arrangements that defined the era's music. In the 1960s, he co-founded the AFO (All For One) Records, the first African-American musician-owned label, and later became part owner of Parlo Records, which released Aaron Neville’s classic 'Tell It Like It Is.'[1][2][5][6]

Though Tyler was deeply involved in R&B for much of his career, jazz remained his true passion. In his later years, he focused on jazz performance and recording, releasing acclaimed albums such as 'Graciously' and 'Heritage.' He collaborated with a new generation of New Orleans musicians and was honored by the City of New Orleans with 'Alvin Red Tyler Day' in 1997, recognizing his immense contributions to the city’s musical legacy.[1][3][7]
