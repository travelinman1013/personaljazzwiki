## Biography
James Ingram was born in Akron, Ohio, in 1952 and began his musical journey performing with his band Revelation Funk, which opened for the Ohio Players in the early 1970s. After relocating to Los Angeles in 1973, Ingram initially struggled, working as a session musician and backup singer for artists such as Ray Charles, for whom he played organ on the 1977 hit 'I Can See Clearly Now.' His breakthrough came when Quincy Jones heard his demo of 'Just Once' and invited him to record vocals for three tracks on Jones's 1981 album 'The Dude,' including 'Just Once' and 'One Hundred Ways.' These performances earned Ingram his first Grammy and catapulted him into the spotlight as a solo artist[2][1][5].

Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Ingram became known for his smooth, gospel-trained baritone and his versatility across genres such as R&B, pop, and adult contemporary. He released his debut solo album 'It's Your Night' in 1983, which included hits like 'Yah Mo B There' with Michael McDonald and 'Baby, Come to Me' with Patti Austin. Ingram was also a prolific collaborator, co-writing Michael Jackson's 'P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)' and contributing to the charity single 'We Are the World.' His duet 'Somewhere Out There' with Linda Ronstadt for the animated film 'An American Tail' became a Grammy-winning hit. Ingram's later career included Oscar-nominated songs for film soundtracks and a gospel album, 'Stand (In the Light),' released in 2008[2][1][5].

James Ingram's legacy is marked by his emotive vocal style, influential songwriting, and extensive collaborations with some of the biggest names in music. He continued to perform internationally into the 2010s and was recognized for both his solo work and his contributions to major musical projects. Ingram passed away in 2019 after a battle with brain cancer, leaving behind a lasting impact on the music industry[2][5].
