## Biography
Leslie Johnson, known professionally as Lazy Lester, was born on June 20, 1933, in Torras, Louisiana, near Baton Rouge. He emerged as one of the key architects of the "swamp blues" sound in the 1950s, a distinctive South Louisiana style that blended blues with regional influences. His entry into professional music came through a chance encounter with Lightnin' Slim on a bus in the mid-1950s, which led to his recording debut in 1956. Lester quickly became an indispensable session musician for producer Jay Miller at Excello Records, contributing harmonica, guitar, and percussion to recordings by numerous artists including Lightnin' Slim, Slim Harpo, Lonesome Sundown, Katie Webster, Clifton Chenier, and Tabby Thomas. Miller gave him the nickname "Lazy Lester" due to his carefree personality.

As a solo artist, Lester created swamp blues classics that, while not major chart hits initially, became enduring favorites and were covered by a remarkable range of artists. His high-pitched harmonica style and laid-back vocal delivery became blues archetypes. Songs like "I'm a Lover Not a Fighter," "I Hear You Knockin'," and "Sugar Coated Love" were later recorded by the Kinks, the Fabulous Thunderbirds, Dwight Yoakam, Dave Edmunds, and many others. However, disputes over songwriting credits with producer Jay Miller—who was credited on songs Lester claimed to have written—left him embittered and receiving few royalties, leading him to abandon music in the late 1960s.

Lester relocated to Pontiac, Michigan, where he worked in an auto plant and lived in obscurity for nearly two decades, residing with Slim Harpo's sister. A 1971 performance at the University of Chicago Folk Festival with Lightnin' Slim briefly brought him back, but his full comeback didn't occur until 1987 when he toured England and recorded new material. From the late 1980s onward, he recorded for labels including Alligator, Blue Horizon, Antone's, and Telarc, performing internationally well into 2018. He was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 2012, received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Boston Blues Society in 2002, and appeared in Martin Scorsese's 2003 blues tribute concert at Radio City Music Hall, documented in "Lightning in a Bottle." Lester continued performing until shortly before his death from cancer on August 22, 2018, at age 85, having lived his final years in Paradise, California.

## Fun Facts
- The Ponderosa Stomp, one of the world's premier roots music gatherings in New Orleans, took its name from Lazy Lester's last Excello single.
- During his two decades away from music (mid-1960s to mid-1980s), Lester worked in an auto plant in Michigan and spent his free time pursuing his favorite hobby—fishing—having given up on the music industry due to royalty disputes.
- In 2018, at age 85 and in the final year of his life, Lazy Lester appeared and performed in a nationally-aired Geico Insurance television commercial.
- In Martin Scorsese's 2003 blues tribute concert film 'Lightning in a Bottle,' the group photograph inside the album depicted Lester grinning dead-center among legendary peers including B.B. King, Buddy Guy, Solomon Burke, John Fogerty, and Aerosmith, symbolizing his central role in blues history despite years of obscurity.
