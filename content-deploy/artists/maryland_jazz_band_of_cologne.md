## Biography
The Maryland Jazz Band of Cologne is a long‑running German traditional jazz ensemble founded in 1959 in the Cologne region by brothers Peter Colditz (clarinet) and Rüdiger Colditz (cornet) as a student band devoted to New Orleans–style jazz.[1][2] Initially active until 1967, the group built its reputation in Germany as one of the earliest ensembles to specialize in classic New Orleans repertoire at a time when modern jazz styles were becoming more dominant.[1] In 1975 the band was re‑formed in Kerpen, near Cologne, with the original members; at this point trombonist Gerhard “Doggy” Hund took over as leader and would guide the band’s musical direction and activities for four decades.[1]

Under Hund’s leadership, the Maryland Jazz Band of Cologne developed into one of Germany’s most prominent New Orleans jazz bands, known for a traditional seven‑piece lineup and an authentic, swinging style rooted in the pre‑war New Orleans ensemble tradition.[1][4] From the mid‑1990s the group cultivated a close relationship with the city of New Orleans, traveling there regularly around Easter between 1996 and 2014, performing at events including the French Quarter Festival and the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, and being named honorary citizens of New Orleans in 1994.[1] In line with Hund’s wishes after his death in 2015, the band officially changed its name in early 2016 to **New Orleans Jazz Band of Cologne**, continuing its activities with a slightly altered lineup while preserving its traditional New Orleans sound.[1][2][4]

The band’s musical style centers on ensemble‑based New Orleans jazz, featuring collective improvisation, a repertoire of classic tunes, and collaborations with veteran New Orleans musicians.[1][4] Over the decades it has appeared widely at European festivals such as JazzAscona (Switzerland) and Jazz Davos Klosters (Switzerland), organized the “Internationale Jazznacht” in Kerpen, and released numerous recordings, including live sessions with noted New Orleans guests like Louis Nelson, Percy Humphrey, Sing Miller, and others.[1] Celebrated as one of the oldest German bands in the New Orleans style, it marked its 65th anniversary in 2024, underlining its legacy as a key ambassador for traditional New Orleans jazz in Germany and beyond.[1][4]
