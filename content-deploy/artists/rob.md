## Biography
Robyn, born Robin Miriam Carlsson on June 12, 1979, in Stockholm, Sweden, is a renowned Swedish pop singer, songwriter, record producer, and DJ. She began her musical journey at a young age, recording her first theme song for Swedish television at age 12 and performing original material on national TV. Discovered by pop singer Meja in the early 1990s, Robyn signed her first record deal at 14 and released her debut album 'Robyn Is Here' in 1995, which produced international hits like 'Do You Know (What It Takes)' and 'Show Me Love.'

Robyn's career evolved through the late 1990s and 2000s, marked by a shift toward electronic and dance-pop influences. Her critically acclaimed self-titled album 'Robyn' (2005) and the 'Body Talk' series (2010) solidified her reputation for blending upbeat, dance-oriented music with introspective and often melancholic lyrics. The single 'Dancing On My Own' became her signature song and a defining track of the decade, earning her global recognition and a loyal fanbase. Robyn has continued to innovate, collaborating with artists like Röyksopp and La Bagatelle Magique, and releasing the celebrated album 'Honey' in 2018.

Robyn's legacy lies in her ability to combine emotional vulnerability with infectious pop production, influencing a new generation of pop and electronic artists. Her music is celebrated for its honesty, dancefloor appeal, and progressive approach to pop songwriting, making her one of Sweden's most influential contemporary musicians.
