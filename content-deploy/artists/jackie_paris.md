## Biography
Jackie Paris, born Carlo Jackie Paris on September 20, 1924, in Nutley, New Jersey, emerged from a musical Italian-American family and began his career as a child performer in vaudeville, sharing stages with legends like Bill "Bojangles" Robinson and the Mills Brothers. After serving in the Army during World War II, Paris returned to New York and quickly became a fixture on the city's vibrant 52nd Street jazz scene, performing as both a singer and guitarist. Inspired by his friend Nat King Cole, he formed the Jackie Paris Trio, which gained acclaim at the Onyx Club.

Paris's career flourished in the late 1940s and 1950s, when he became closely associated with the bebop movement. He toured with Charlie Parker's Quintet, recorded with Charles Mingus, and was the first to record a vocal version of Thelonious Monk's "'Round Midnight." Paris also worked with Lionel Hampton and Dizzy Gillespie's big bands, earning praise for his sensitive interpretations and jazz inflection. Despite critical acclaim and winning several critics' polls, he never achieved widespread commercial fame, but remained a respected figure among musicians and jazz aficionados.

Throughout his life, Paris continued to perform, record, and teach, collaborating with his then-wife Anne-Marie Moss in the 1960s and 1970s and working as an educator in his later years. His last album, "The Intimate Jackie Paris," was released in 2001, and he performed publicly as late as March 2004. Jackie Paris died in Manhattan on June 17, 2004, leaving behind a legacy as a vocalist deeply admired for his artistry and commitment to jazz.
