## Biography
Mike Doussan is a New Orleans-born singer-songwriter and guitarist whose music embodies the vibrant spirit and emotional depth of his hometown. Picking up the guitar at age eight, Doussan was captivated early by the sounds of classic vinyl and the spectacle of rock and roll, notably inspired by the energy of MTV and iconic performances like Pete Townshend's guitar-smashing antics. By his early twenties, he had become a fixture in the New Orleans club scene, initially as a sideman with acts such as Mike Hood and the Frenchmen St. Delegation and Eric Lindell, before stepping into the spotlight as a bandleader. 

Doussan's career has been marked by a steady evolution from funk and blues roots toward a more nuanced, songwriter-driven approach, blending Americana, roots rock, and the unmistakable flavor of New Orleans. His debut album was recorded just before Hurricane Katrina, and his subsequent work has consistently reflected themes of love, struggle, and hope. Personal tragedy, including the loss of his brother, led Doussan to co-found the BTD Foundation, channeling his music into mental health advocacy. His 2019 album 'Yesterday’s Troubles' and his recent work with the trio Doussan Garrett Benoit showcase his growth as both a performer and a storyteller, earning him accolades such as a Grammy nomination for his contributions to Big Chief Monk Boudreaux’s live recording. 

Known for his soulful guitar work and honest lyricism, Doussan continues to be a sought-after collaborator and a pillar of the New Orleans music community. His music, steeped in the traditions of the Crescent City yet unafraid to explore new territory, has left a lasting imprint on the local scene and beyond.
