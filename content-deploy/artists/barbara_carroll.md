## Biography
Barbara Carroll, born Barbara Carole Coppersmith on January 25, 1925, in Worcester, Massachusetts, was a pioneering American jazz pianist and vocalist. She began playing piano as a young child, inspired by the sounds she heard at home and on the radio, and started formal classical training around age eight. Carroll attended the New England Conservatory of Music but left after a year, feeling her passion for jazz was not being fulfilled. During World War II, she led an all-female trio for USO shows, adopting the stage name 'Carroll.'

In the late 1940s, Carroll moved to New York City, quickly establishing herself in the vibrant jazz scene. She became known for her sophisticated bebop-influenced piano style and elegant melodic lines, performing at top clubs and concert halls, including Carnegie Hall and the Newport Jazz Festival. Carroll worked with jazz greats such as Benny Goodman, Billie Holiday, Stan Getz, and Paul Desmond, and was often noted as the first prominent female disciple of the Bud Powell school of bop piano. Her career spanned over seven decades, during which she also became a celebrated cabaret performer, renowned for her refined touch and expressive singing.

Barbara Carroll's legacy is marked by her trailblazing role as a woman in jazz, her contributions to the development of modern jazz piano, and her influence on generations of musicians. She received numerous accolades, including being named a Steinway Artist in 1957 and winning the MAC Award for Best Major Jazz Performance in 1998. Carroll continued to perform into her nineties, leaving an indelible mark on jazz and cabaret music.
