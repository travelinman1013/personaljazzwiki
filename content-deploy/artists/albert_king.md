## Biography
Albert King, born Albert Nelson on April 25, 1923, in Indianola, Mississippi, was a towering figure in the world of electric blues, renowned for his powerful string-bending guitar style and soulful, smoky vocals[1][2][3]. Raised in a large, musically inclined family—one of 13 children—King grew up in the Mississippi Delta before moving to Arkansas as a child, where he worked as a farmhand and later as a bulldozer operator[1][2][4]. His early musical experiences included singing in a family gospel group and constructing his first instrument from a cigar box, but he soon transitioned to blues, inspired by Delta legends like Elmore James and Robert Nighthawk, whom he heard performing in West Memphis, Arkansas[1][3][4]. King was largely self-taught, developing a unique approach by playing a right-handed guitar upside down as a left-handed player, which contributed to his distinctive sound—sparse, single-note lines with intense sustain and a deep, emotive voice[1][2][4].

King’s career took off in the 1950s and 1960s as he moved through the Midwest, recording for labels like Parrot, Bobbin, and King, and eventually joining Stax Records in Memphis, where he released his seminal 1967 album *Born Under a Bad Sign*[1][2][3]. This album, along with hits like “Crosscut Saw” and “I’ll Play the Blues for You,” cemented his reputation as a key figure in blues, rhythm-and-blues, and rock music, influencing generations of guitarists[1][2][3]. King’s blend of Delta blues with Memphis soul made him one of the “Three Kings of the Blues” (alongside B.B. King and Freddie King), and his legacy endures through his innovative techniques and the profound impact he had on both blues and rock guitar playing[1][3][5]. He continued to tour and record until his death from a heart attack in 1992, leaving behind a body of work that remains foundational to modern blues and rock[1][2][3].

## Fun Facts
- Albert King was left-handed but played a right-handed guitar upside down, creating his signature sound by pulling the strings down instead of up[1][2][4].
- He was known for his towering physical presence, standing 6’4” and weighing over 250 pounds, earning him the nickname 'The Velvet Bulldozer'[1][6].
- King’s main guitar, a Gibson Flying V named 'Lucy,' became iconic in blues history for its distinctive tone and sustain[2][4].
- He rarely used a guitar pick, preferring to play with the meat of his thumb for a warmer, more expressive sound[4].
