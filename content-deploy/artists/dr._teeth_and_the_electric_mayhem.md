## Biography
Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem are a fictional Muppet rock band created by Jim Henson and his team, first appearing in the 1975 pilot special *The Muppet Show: Sex and Violence*. They became the house band for the long-running variety series *The Muppet Show* (1976–1981), where they performed opening and closing themes, backed guest stars, and delivered their own musical numbers. The band’s core lineup consists of Dr. Teeth (lead vocals and keyboards), Floyd Pepper (bass), Janice (guitar and vocals), Zoot (saxophone), and Animal (drums), with trumpeter Lips joining later as a permanent member. Over the decades, they have appeared in nearly every major Muppet film and television special, from *The Muppet Movie* (1979) to *The Muppets* (2011) and the Disney+ series *The Muppets Mayhem* (2023), where they are portrayed as striving to record their first official studio album.

Musically, Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem blend rock, funk, soul, jazz, and pop, often covering classic hits while also performing original songs like 'Can You Picture That?' and 'Rock On.' Their style is a playful, exaggerated homage to 1970s rock and jazz ensembles, with each member embodying a distinct musical archetype. The band’s legacy lies in their role as the Muppets’ primary musical ensemble, bringing energy and humor to countless performances while maintaining a surprisingly authentic sound. Their enduring popularity has led to real-world music releases, viral videos, and even a live concert appearance at the Outside Lands Music and Arts Festival in 2016, cementing their status as one of the most recognizable fictional bands in entertainment history.

## Fun Facts
- The band’s first appearance was in the 1975 pilot special 'The Muppet Show: Sex and Violence,' which was rejected by American networks but led to the creation of 'The Muppet Show' in syndication.
- Animal is the only Muppet to appear in every theatrical Muppet film, making him the most consistently featured member of the Electric Mayhem.
- Lips, the trumpeter, was inspired by jazz legend Louis Armstrong, and performer Steve Whitmire was initially concerned that doing a Louis Armstrong–style voice might be offensive.
- In 2016, Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem performed a live concert at the Outside Lands Music and Arts Festival in San Francisco, blending puppetry with real musicianship.
