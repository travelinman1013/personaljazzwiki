## Biography
Karen Dalton, born Jean Karen Cariker in Bonham, Texas, and raised in Oklahoma, emerged as a singular voice in the 1960s American folk revival. After two early marriages, she arrived in New York City's Greenwich Village with her guitar and banjo, quickly becoming a fixture in the burgeoning folk scene. Her distinctive voice, often compared to Billie Holiday, and her interpretive prowess on guitar and banjo set her apart from her peers. Dalton was known for her interpretations of songs by contemporaries like Tim Hardin and Fred Neil, and she was among the first to perform Hardin's 'Reason to Believe.'

Richard Tucker, a singer, songwriter, and guitarist, was active in the same circles, having traveled with the Merry Pranksters and collaborated with Tim Hardin. Tucker and Dalton's partnership was both musical and personal; they married and performed as a duo and with others, including Hardin. The couple moved between New York and Colorado, seeking both creative inspiration and respite from the pressures of city life. Their relationship, marked by artistic synergy and personal tumult, lasted about five years and deeply influenced Dalton's musical output. Together, they co-wrote songs like 'Sleeping in the Garden,' which showcased Dalton's rarely acknowledged songwriting ability.

Dalton's legacy is that of a cult figure whose influence has grown posthumously. Her reluctance to record and perform her own songs, combined with struggles with addiction and poverty, limited her mainstream exposure during her lifetime. However, her emotional depth, unique phrasing, and raw authenticity have inspired generations of musicians, and her recordings are now revered as touchstones of the folk genre.
