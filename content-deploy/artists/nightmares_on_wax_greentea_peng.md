## Biography
Greentea Peng, born Aria Wells on December 1, 1994, in South East London, is an English singer-songwriter celebrated for her unique blend of neo-soul, psychedelic R&B, and influences from hip hop, dub reggae, and jazz. Her early life was marked by significant upheaval; after her parents separated when she was 12, she moved with her mother to Hastings but often returned to London to visit her father. Despite an early passion for music, bullying and a loss of self-confidence led her to stop performing by age 15. After leaving school early, she returned to London at 17, working in bars and nightclubs while struggling with substance abuse and depression.

A transformative period came when she traveled to Tulum, Mexico, where she worked at a yoga retreat and began to embrace spirituality and self-healing. This experience rekindled her love for music, and upon returning to London, she met producer Earbuds, with whom she created her debut EP 'Sensi' in 2018. Greentea Peng quickly gained recognition for her introspective lyrics and genre-blending sound, with standout tracks like 'Downers' and 'Ghost Town' addressing personal struggles and social issues. Her subsequent releases, including the mixtape 'Greenzone 108' and albums 'Man Made' (2021) and 'Tell Dem It's Sunny' (2025), have solidified her reputation as a bold and innovative voice in contemporary British music. Her artistry is defined by a balance of vulnerability and strength, spiritual exploration, and a commitment to authenticity.
