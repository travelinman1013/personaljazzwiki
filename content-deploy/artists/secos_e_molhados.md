## Biography
Secos e Molhados is a Brazilian vocal and instrumental group formed in São Paulo in the early 1970s that became one of the most important and iconoclastic acts in MPB and Brazilian rock, despite an extremely short initial lifespan.[6][2] Conceived by Portuguese-born poet, journalist, and composer João Ricardo, who had emigrated from Arcozelo to Brazil with his family in 1964, the group’s name was inspired by a grocery-store sign (“Secos & Molhados,” meaning “dry and wet goods”) he saw in Ubatuba in 1971 and decided would suit a rock band.[1][2] An early 1971 formation included João Ricardo on 12‑string guitar and harmonica, Fred on percussion, and Antônio Carlos de Lima on vocals, performing in São Paulo clubs, but this version dissolved when the singer left.[2] Ricardo then joined forces with architecture student Gerson Conrad, whom he had met as a neighbor in São Paulo in 1968, and the pair later recruited singer and actor Ney Matogrosso—then a young hippie artisan in Rio de Janeiro—to front a new trio lineup that began rehearsing in early 1972.[1][2][3]

With Matogrosso’s striking high tenor voice and androgynous, heavily made‑up stage persona, plus Ricardo and Conrad’s acoustic guitars and vocal harmonies, Secos e Molhados fused MPB, rock, folk, and Portuguese‑language poetry into a politically charged, theatrical show that emerged in the midst of Brazil’s military dictatorship.[1][2][3] Their self‑titled debut album, recorded in just 15 days in São Paulo and released in 1973, sold around one million copies in its first year, an unprecedented feat that turned the band into a national phenomenon and a symbol of cultural rebellion.[2][3] The group’s lyrics—often written with poet Paulinho Mendonça or adapted from modernist and symbolist poets such as Manuel Bandeira, Vinicius de Moraes, and Oswald de Andrade—used metaphor and allegory to evade censorship while addressing themes of freedom, desire, and existential angst, all framed by inventive arrangements that brought together rock instrumentation, Brazilian rhythms, and European influences.[1] At the height of their fame, they set audience records, including a 1974 concert at Rio’s Maracanãzinho for about 20,000 people, with another 20,000 reportedly unable to get in.[3]

Internally, however, the classic trio of Ney Matogrosso, João Ricardo, and Gerson Conrad lasted barely two years, from 1973 to 1974, amid managerial disputes and personal and artistic tensions.[1][2] By mid‑1974, after intense touring—including more than 365 shows in roughly 11 months and performances in Mexico—the original lineup had disintegrated, leaving only two studio LPs and roughly 26 recorded songs from the classic phase, yet those works profoundly marked Brazilian pop culture.[1][3] Ricardo would later lead other formations of Secos & Molhados with different musicians through the 1970s and in later revivals, but it was the early trio’s mix of political subversion, queer and gender‑bending aesthetics, and poetic MPB‑rock that secured the group’s legacy.[1][6] Decades later, tribute projects such as the 2003 album "Assim Assado," featuring artists like Nando Reis, Ira!, Capital Inicial, Arnaldo Antunes, and Ritchie, and biographical books and documentaries released around the band’s 50th anniversary, attest to Secos e Molhados’ status as an enduring reference point in Brazilian music and a "lightning bolt of freedom" during one of the country’s darkest political periods.[1][3]

## Fun Facts
- The band’s name came from a sign on a simple grocery store in Ubatuba, São Paulo; when João Ricardo first suggested "Secos & Molhados" as a rock‑band name, his friends laughed, which convinced him it was perfect.[1][2]
- At their commercial peak, Secos e Molhados reportedly performed more than 365 shows in just 11 months, effectively averaging more than one concert per day across Brazil.[1]
- A 1974 concert at Rio’s Maracanãzinho drew about 20,000 people inside the venue while roughly another 20,000 fans were left outside without tickets, an unprecedented turnout for a single Brazilian act at the time.[3]
- In 2003, for the 30th anniversary of their debut album, a tribute record titled "Assim Assado" gathered artists such as Nando Reis, Ira!, Capital Inicial, Arnaldo Antunes, and Ritchie, highlighting how their songs remained contemporary and "atemporal" decades after their release.[1]
