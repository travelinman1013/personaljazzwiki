## Biography
Jewell "Babe" Stovall (October 14, 1907 – September 21, 1974) was an influential Delta blues singer and guitarist, born in Tylertown, Mississippi, as the youngest of eleven children. He began playing guitar at the age of eight and was deeply shaped by the rural musical traditions of his family and community. By his early twenties, Stovall had developed a distinctive style, influenced by blues legend Tommy Johnson, whom he met around 1930. Stovall spent much of the 1930s and 1940s moving between Mississippi and Louisiana, performing at local gatherings and working as a farmhand.

In 1964, Stovall relocated to New Orleans, where he became a fixture in the French Quarter, known for his powerful voice and crowd-pleasing showmanship, such as playing his National Steel guitar behind his head. He recorded his debut album for Verve in 1964, followed by further sessions in 1966 and 1968, which were later released as 'The Babe Stovall Story' and 'The Old Ace: Mississippi Blues & Religious Songs.' Stovall was a regular performer at the Dream Palace Bar and The Quarum club, and he played at the first five New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festivals. He was also known for mentoring young musicians, passing on traditional country blues techniques and songs. Stovall died of natural causes in New Orleans in 1974, leaving behind a legacy as a bridge between the original Delta blues era and the 1960s folk revival.
