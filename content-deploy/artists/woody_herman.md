## Biography
Woody Herman, born Woodrow Charles Herman on May 16, 1913, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, emerged as one of the most influential and innovative bandleaders in jazz history. His early exposure to show business came from his father’s passion for entertainment, which led Herman to perform as a singer and tap dancer in vaudeville before he began playing clarinet and saxophone by age 12[2][5]. After brief studies at Marquette University, he joined the Tom Gerun band and later performed with orchestras led by Harry Sosnick, Gus Arnheim, and notably Isham Jones, whose band he eventually took over in 1936[2][3][4].

Herman's first major success came with his ensemble, the "Band That Plays the Blues," which gained national attention with the 1939 hit "Woodchopper’s Ball," selling over a million copies and becoming his signature tune[3][5]. Throughout the 1940s, Herman led a succession of bands known as "The Herds," each marked by their progressive approach to big band jazz, incorporating elements of swing, bebop, cool jazz, and Latin rhythms[1][5]. His First Herd was renowned for its tight harmonies and virtuosic solos, while the Second Herd (the "Four Brothers Band") featured future jazz legends like Stan Getz and Zoot Sims[5]. Herman’s willingness to experiment with new sounds and instruments, including the bassoon and French horn, kept his music fresh and relevant through the changing landscape of jazz[5].

Over a career spanning nearly five decades, Woody Herman received multiple Grammy Awards and was celebrated for nurturing young talent, many of whom became major figures in jazz[3]. His legacy is defined by his adaptability, his commitment to musical innovation, and his role as a mentor to generations of jazz musicians. Herman continued performing and teaching into the 1980s, leaving an indelible mark on the evolution of big band and modern jazz[1][2][5].
