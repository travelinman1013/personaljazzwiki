## Biography
George Andrew Cables, born November 14, 1944, in New York City, is a highly respected American jazz pianist and composer. Classically trained from a young age by his mother, Cables attended the renowned High School of Performing Arts and later studied at Mannes College of Music. His early exposure to both classical and jazz traditions laid the foundation for his versatile approach to music. At 18, he formed the Jazz Samaritans, a group that included future jazz luminaries such as Billy Cobham and Clint Houston, quickly attracting attention in New York's vibrant club scene.[1][2][3][4]

Cables' career accelerated through collaborations with major figures like Max Roach, Art Blakey, and Sonny Rollins, with a pivotal 1969 tour with Rollins leading him to the West Coast. By the early 1970s, he had become a significant figure in the Los Angeles and San Francisco jazz communities, working with artists such as Joe Henderson, Freddie Hubbard, Woody Shaw, and Bobby Hutcherson. His two-year tenure with Dexter Gordon's quartet in the late 1970s reignited his passion for acoustic piano and deepened his engagement with the bebop tradition. Cables is celebrated for his lyrical improvisation, innovative arrangements, and ability to blend hard bop, cool jazz, and modern jazz idioms.[2][3][4]

Throughout his career, Cables has recorded prolifically as both a leader and sideman, contributing to landmark albums and composing original works noted for their melodic richness and harmonic sophistication. He continues to perform internationally, lead ensembles, and teach, leaving a lasting legacy as a major voice in modern jazz and an influential figure for generations of musicians.[2][3][4][9]
