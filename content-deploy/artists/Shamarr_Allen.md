## Biography
Shamarr Allen, born and raised in the Lower 9th Ward of New Orleans, Louisiana, was immersed in the city’s vibrant musical culture from a young age. His father, a saxophonist, was his first music teacher, and by age seven, Allen was already learning the fundamentals of music. He played in both concert and marching bands throughout his school years, often serving as section leader, and attended the prestigious Louis 'Satchmo' Armstrong Summer Jazz Camp, where he studied under renowned jazz educators such as Edward 'Kidd' Jordan, Clyde Kerr Jr., Herlin Riley, and Alvin Batiste. By age 13, he was performing with the Pittsburgh University Orchestra, and at 16, he appeared at Carnegie Hall with the Mahogany Brass Band.[2]

He later formed his own group, Shamarr Allen & The Underdawgs, where he serves as lead vocalist and trumpeter. Allen’s genre-defying approach blends jazz, hip-hop, rock, funk, blues, country, and New Orleans bounce, a style showcased on albums such as 'Bandhead.' He is also a composer, writer, and producer, and has collaborated with major artists including Willie Nelson, Patti LaBelle, Harry Connick Jr., Lenny Kravitz, and Galactic.[1][4]

His innovative fusion of traditional and contemporary styles, along with his dedication to community and mentorship, cements his legacy as a leading figure in modern New Orleans music.[2][3][4]
