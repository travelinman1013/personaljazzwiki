## Biography
The Cranberries were an Irish rock band formed in Limerick in 1989, originally under the name The Cranberry Saw Us. The founding lineup included brothers Noel (guitar) and Mike Hogan (bass), drummer Fergal Lawler, and singer Niall Quinn. After Quinn's departure in 1990, Dolores O'Riordan joined as lead vocalist and lyricist, bringing a distinctive voice and songwriting talent that transformed the group's sound[1][4]. Their early demos and local gigs quickly attracted industry attention, leading to a contract with Island Records in 1991[1][2].

The band's debut album, 'Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can't We?' (1993), propelled them to international fame with hits like 'Linger' and 'Dreams.' Their follow-up, 'No Need to Argue' (1994), featured the iconic protest song 'Zombie,' cementing their reputation for blending ethereal vocals with alternative rock, indie, folk, and pop influences[1][2][4]. Throughout the 1990s, The Cranberries released several successful albums, including 'To the Faithful Departed' (1996) and 'Bury the Hatchet' (1999), but faced challenges with label changes and shifting musical trends in the early 2000s[1].

The Cranberries' legacy is marked by Dolores O'Riordan's emotive voice and the band's fusion of Irish folk melodies with contemporary rock. Their music addressed personal and political themes, resonating with audiences worldwide. The group is credited with influencing a generation of artists and remains one of Ireland's most successful musical exports[1][3][4].
