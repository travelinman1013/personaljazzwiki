## Biography
Durand Jones & The Indications is an American retro soul group formed in 2012 by singer Durand Jones, singer/drummer Aaron Frazer, and guitarist Blake Rhein. The band originated at Indiana University's Jacobs School of Music, where Frazer and Rhein met Jones, a Louisiana native studying classical saxophone. Their shared passion for vintage soul records and songwriting led to the creation of the group, which quickly became a prominent force in the soul revival movement. The Indications released their self-titled debut in 2016, followed by 'American Love Call' in 2019, 'Private Space' in 2021, and 'Flowers' in 2025, each album expanding their blend of classic R&B, soul, and disco with socially conscious lyrics and lush arrangements.[1][5]

Aaron Frazer, born in 1991 in Baltimore, Maryland, serves as the band's drummer and co-lead vocalist, renowned for his falsetto. Frazer started making hip-hop beats in high school before pivoting to sound engineering at Indiana University, where he met his future bandmates. His songwriting and vocal talents helped shape the group's signature sound, notably on tracks like 'Is It Any Wonder?' and 'Morning In America.' Frazer has also pursued a solo career, releasing 'Introducing...' in 2021, produced by Dan Auerbach, and 'Into The Blue' in 2024, both albums showcasing his ability to fuse soul, gospel, country, and hip-hop influences into contemporary retro soul.[2][3][4]

The Indications are celebrated for their energetic live performances, dual lead vocals, and crate-digging sensibility, drawing inspiration from classic soul while experimenting with modern production techniques. Their legacy lies in revitalizing the genre for new audiences, influencing a wave of young musicians and earning critical acclaim for their authentic yet innovative approach to soul music.[1][5]
