## Biography
Fareed Haque is an American guitarist and composer renowned for his virtuosic command of both classical and jazz traditions and his deep engagement with global musical styles. Born in 1963 in the Chicago area to a Pakistani father and Chilean mother, he spent significant periods of his childhood in Spain, France, Iran, Pakistan, and Chile, experiences that immersed him early in a wide range of musical cultures and helped shape his eclectic voice on the guitar.[1][3][4][6][7] Initially a pianist, he switched to guitar around age 11 at his mother's suggestion, quickly embracing the instrument’s flexibility across classical, jazz, rock, and world music; as a teenager he regularly drove from the suburbs into Chicago to attend late‑night jazz shows, grounding himself in the city’s blues and jazz traditions.[1][2] 

Haque received the Jazz Guitar Scholarship at the University of North Texas in 1981 and studied with noted jazz educator Jack Peterson before transferring to Northwestern University to focus on classical guitar with David Buch, John Holmquist, and Anne Waller.[1][2] While still a student he was active on the Chicago scene, and soon after his transfer he joined Howard Levy’s Latin‑fusion group Chevere, which led to a long association with Cuban NEA Jazz Master Paquito D’Rivera and extensive touring and recording on albums such as “Manhattan Burn,” “Celebration,” “Havana Cafe,” “Tico Tico,” “Live at the MCG,” and the award‑winning “Reunion.”[1] Through D’Rivera, Haque came to the attention of Sting, who signed him to the Pangaea label, releasing the critically acclaimed albums “Voices Rising” and “Manresa” and briefly touring with Sting at venues including the Montreux Jazz Festival and NBC’s “Michelob Presents Sunday Night.”[1] He subsequently recorded three leader albums for Blue Note Records (“Sacred Addiction,” “Opaque,” and “Déjà Vu”), performed classical recitals and concerts with ensembles such as the Vermeer Quartet and various symphonies, and became an associate professor of music at Northern Illinois University, balancing performance with a substantial teaching career.[1][2] 

In the 2000s Haque expanded further into fusion and jam‑band territory, co‑founding the jam super‑group Garaj Mahal in 2001 with Kai Eckhardt, Eric Levy, and Alan Hertz and touring the United States intensively for nearly a decade, producing multiple live and studio albums including “Mondo Garaj,” “Blueberry Cave,” “w00t,” “More Mr. Nice Guy,” and “Discovery,” which showcased his work with the Moog Guitar.[1] He also joined Joe Zawinul’s Zawinul Syndicate and George Brooks’ group Summit (with Zakir Hussain and Steve Smith), premiered large‑scale works such as the “Lahara Double Concerto for Sitar/Guitar and Tabla” with the Chicago Sinfonietta in 2004 and a “Gamelan Concerto” for Fulcrum Point Ensemble in 2006, and later collaborated with drum legend Billy Cobham’s Crosswinds Ensemble.[1] Haque was voted “Most Valuable Player” at the 2002 High Sierra Music Festival and “Best World Guitarist” in Guitar Player Magazine’s 2009 readers’ poll, while his album “Flat Planet” reached #1 on the World Jazz Radio charts twice, underscoring a legacy built on technical mastery, stylistic openness, and a sustained effort to integrate South Asian, Latin American, and other global influences into contemporary jazz, fusion, and classical guitar contexts.[1][2][3][4][7]

## Fun Facts
- Haque originally studied piano for two years before his mother suggested he switch to guitar because it was more portable, a change that set the course for his career.[2]
- As a teenager, he regularly drove from the Chicago suburbs into the city for jazz shows that ran from midnight until 4 a.m., often returning home around 5 a.m. with his parents’ blessing.[2]
- Haque was voted “Most Valuable Player” at the 2002 High Sierra Music Festival, a recognition emerging from the jam‑band scene rather than the traditional jazz world.[1]
- His album “Flat Planet” not only topped the World Jazz Radio charts, it reached #1 twice, highlighting the global appeal of his world‑jazz fusion sound.[1]
