## Biography
Thelonious Sphere Monk (1917–1982) was an American jazz pianist and composer renowned for his pivotal role in the development of bebop and modern jazz. Born in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, Monk moved to New York City at age four, where he began playing piano as a child and was influenced early on by the stride piano tradition. By his teens, Monk was already recognized for his prodigious talent, winning amateur competitions at the Apollo Theater and touring as an organist with an evangelist before settling into the vibrant Harlem jazz scene[1][2][4].

Monk became a central figure at Minton's Playhouse in the early 1940s, collaborating with innovators like Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie to shape the bebop movement. His first recordings were with Coleman Hawkins in 1944, and he later led sessions for Blue Note Records, producing works that showcased his distinctive style: percussive piano technique, angular melodies, dissonant harmonies, and playful improvisation. Despite limited commercial success during his lifetime, Monk's compositions such as "'Round Midnight," "Blue Monk," and "Straight, No Chaser" became jazz standards, and his influence grew steadily, culminating in a feature on the cover of Time magazine in 1963[2][3][4].

Monk's legacy lies in his unique approach to jazz composition and improvisation, which challenged conventions and inspired generations of musicians. He is the second-most-recorded jazz composer after Duke Ellington, and his impact on jazz remains profound, with his works continuing to be performed and studied worldwide[4][1].
