## Biography
Dawn Angeliqué Richard, born August 5, 1983, in New Orleans, Louisiana, is a pioneering American singer, songwriter, and visual artist known for her genre-defying approach to music. She first gained national attention as a founding member of the multi-platinum R&B girl group Danity Kane, formed on MTV's 'Making the Band 3.' After the group's initial success, Richard joined Diddy-Dirty Money, a collaborative project with Sean 'Diddy' Combs, further expanding her musical reach and industry experience.

Transitioning to a solo career, Richard has become renowned for her fearless creativity and innovation, blending R&B, electronic, pop, bounce, jazz, disco, house, and soul to create a unique sonic identity. Albums like 'Goldenheart,' 'New Breed,' and 'Second Line' have earned critical acclaim for their experimental soundscapes and deeply personal storytelling. Her work often draws on her New Orleans roots, infusing her music with the city's rich traditions and rhythms, while her independent spirit has made her a role model for artists seeking to break free from industry conventions. Richard's legacy is marked by her commitment to artistic authenticity, her mentorship of emerging musicians, and her role in redefining the boundaries of Black women in pop and electronic music.
