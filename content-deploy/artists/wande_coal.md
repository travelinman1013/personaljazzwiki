## Biography
Oluwatobi Wande Ojosipe, professionally known as Wande Coal, was born on October 18, 1985, in Lagos Island, Lagos State, Nigeria, to Chief Ibukun Olufunto and Omolara Oluwayemisi Ojosipe. He was the first of two children in his family. Wande Coal's musical journey began in his church's teenage choir, where he developed his vocal skills before gaining initial recognition in the Nigerian entertainment industry as a dancer. He attended Staff Nursery and Primary School in Ijanikin, Lagos, followed by Federal Government College in Lagos, and later studied Human Kinetics at the University of Lagos.

Wande Coal's professional music career took off in 2006 when he signed with Don Jazzy's Mo' Hits Records, a pivotal moment that launched him into the mainstream. He featured prominently on D'banj's album "Rundown/Funk You Up" and became a key member of Mo' Hits Allstars, contributing significantly to their album "CV (Curriculum Vitae)." His single "Ololufe" from this project became iconic, widely regarded as one of the greatest love songs ever created by a Nigerian artist. His debut solo album "Mushin 2 Mo' Hits" achieved massive success across Nigeria, the UK, and the USA, establishing him as a major force in African R&B and Afrobeats.

In 2012, Wande Coal transitioned to Don Jazzy's newly established Mavin Records alongside Dr SID and D'Prince, before launching his own independent label, Black Diamond Entertainment, in November 2013. Throughout his career, he has collaborated with numerous prominent Nigerian artists including Phyno, Davido, and Wizkid, while releasing successful albums such as "Wanted" (2013) and "Legend or No Legend" (2020). His musical style seamlessly blends AfroPop, Afrobeats, and R&B, earning him recognition as a defining voice in contemporary African music with a Spotify popularity rating of 58 across genres including afrobeats, afropop, and afro R&B.
