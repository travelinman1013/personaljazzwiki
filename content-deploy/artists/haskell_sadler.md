## Biography
Haskell Robert 'Cool Papa' Sadler was born on April 16, 1935, in Denver, Colorado. He became a prominent figure in the blues scene, particularly in California. In 1954, Cool Papa moved to Los Angeles, where he met harmonica player Sidney Maiden and recorded several tracks for producer J.R. Fulbright. These recordings included 'Do right mind' and 'Gone for good,' which were later sold to the Flash label. His musical career spanned multiple decades, with a notable album 'Cool Papa & The All Star Band' released in 1982, featuring raw and tasty blues with his distinctive guitar playing. Cool Papa passed away on May 6, 1994, in Berkeley, California.

Throughout his career, Cool Papa was known for his fluid and aerial guitar style, which was highlighted in his work with The Mellotones. He recorded for various labels, including Melodia and T.J. Records, showcasing his versatility as a blues singer, songwriter, and guitarist. His legacy includes being a fixture on the East Bay music scene, where he was admired for his performances with his trademark white Gibson guitar.

Cool Papa's life was marked by periods of relocation and musical exploration. After leaving Los Angeles, he formed a new group, Fatt Twice Together, and eventually returned to California in 1970. His contributions to the blues genre are remembered through his recordings and live performances, which continue to inspire blues enthusiasts today.
