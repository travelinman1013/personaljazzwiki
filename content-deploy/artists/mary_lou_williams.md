## Biography
Mary Lou Williams was a pioneering American jazz pianist, composer, and arranger born on May 8, 1910, in Atlanta, Georgia. She grew up in Pittsburgh, where she began playing piano at a young age, displaying prodigious talent. By the time she was ten, she was known as 'the Little Piano Girl' and was performing for small audiences. Her professional career started early, with her first big band performance at age 12. Williams married saxophonist John Overton Williams at 17 and eventually joined Andy Kirk and His Clouds of Joy, becoming a key figure in the jazz scene with her innovative compositions and arrangements. She was a versatile musician, excelling in stride, swing, and bebop styles. In the 1950s, Williams experienced a spiritual awakening, leading her to compose sacred music and establish the Bel Canto Foundation to support musicians in recovery. She taught at Duke University from 1977 until her death in 1981, leaving a legacy as a groundbreaking artist who challenged traditional perceptions of jazz, gender, and race. Williams' contributions to jazz include over 300 original compositions and numerous arrangements for prominent artists like Duke Ellington and Benny Goodman. Her influence extended beyond music, as she played a significant role in fostering Black culture and faculty at Duke University. Williams' apartment became a hub for younger musicians, including Charlie Parker and Thelonious Monk, who were influenced by her work and mentorship.
