## Biography
Jorja Alice Smith, born on June 11, 1997, in Walsall, West Midlands, England, is a critically acclaimed English singer and songwriter. Raised in a musically inclined family—her Jamaican father was a former neo-soul musician and her English mother a jewelry designer—Smith began piano lessons at age eight and wrote her first song at eleven. She attended Aldridge School on a music scholarship, where she learned classical singing and the oboe. Discovered at fifteen after uploading YouTube covers, she soon traveled to London for songwriting sessions, balancing her burgeoning career with school and later supporting herself as a barista after moving to London at eighteen.[2][1]

Smith's career accelerated in 2016 with the release of her debut single "Blue Lights" on SoundCloud, which quickly garnered significant attention. Her debut EP, 'Project 11,' followed later that year, and she was named to the BBC Sound of 2017 list. Smith's soulful blend of R&B, hip-hop, and jazz influences—shaped by her love for artists like Amy Winehouse—culminated in her 2018 debut album 'Lost & Found,' which peaked at number three on the UK Albums Chart and earned her the Brit Critics' Choice Award. She has since collaborated with notable artists such as Drake, Stormzy, and Kali Uchis, and her music often addresses social issues, reflecting her commitment to meaningful songwriting.[2][5][3]

Smith's artistry is marked by her emotive vocals and introspective lyrics, drawing from a diverse palette of genres including reggae, punk, and soul. Her impact is evident in the critical acclaim and awards she has received, including the Brit Award for Best British Female Artist and a Grammy nomination for Best New Artist, solidifying her legacy as one of the leading voices of her generation.[2][5]
