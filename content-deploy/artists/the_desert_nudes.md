## Biography
The Desert Nudes are a New Orleans-based trio that emerged in 2024 as a fresh voice in American western and cowboy music. The band is a collaboration between keyboardist Andre Bohren, guitarist John Paul Carmody, and vocalist David Pomerleau, who are known commodities in the New Orleans music scene due to their long tenure as drummer and bassist respectively for the local band Johnny Sketch and the Dirty Skirts.[5] Drawing from the deep well of western and cowboy songs, The Desert Nudes released their debut album "Keep A-Movin', Dan" in 2024 on Lazy Day Records, subtitled "Songs Of Hydration, Vigor, Horses & Wide Open Spaces."[3] The album showcases the band's ability to blend traditional western classics with original compositions, featuring close harmonies, solid instrumental playing, and a subtle sense of humor that brings new life to the genre.[3]

The Desert Nudes' musical approach is rooted in the classic traditions of western music, with their repertoire including legendary songs such as "Cool Water" (a Sons of the Pioneers classic), "Tumbling Tumbleweeds," "Home On The Range," and "Ghost Riders In The Sky."[2] Their music is equally at home around a campfire or on a big stage, demonstrating versatility in both intimate and larger performance settings.[4] The trio's work represents a contemporary appreciation for and preservation of American cowboy and western musical traditions, introducing these timeless songs to modern audiences through their distinctive arrangements and interpretations.

- The album title "Keep A-Movin', Dan" is derived from a lyric in the classic Sons of the Pioneers song "Cool Water," which also appears on the album.[3]

- The band members use stage names: John Paul Carmody performs as Dan Hidalgo, David Pomerleau as Dan Boulevard, and Andre Bohren as Dan Lopez.[2]
