## Biography
Charles Mingus Jr. (April 22, 1922 – January 5, 1979) was one of the most influential figures in 20th-century American music, renowned as a virtuoso bassist, pianist, bandleader, and composer. Born on a military base in Nogales, Arizona, and raised in Watts, California, Mingus’s earliest musical influences came from gospel and church music, as well as from hearing Duke Ellington on the radio as a child. He began studying music formally at a young age, focusing on double bass and composition, and was mentored by H. Rheinshagen, principal bassist of the New York Philharmonic, and composer Lloyd Reese. Mingus’s early professional career in the 1940s saw him touring with jazz legends such as Louis Armstrong, Kid Ory, and Lionel Hampton, before settling in New York where he played and recorded with leading figures like Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, Bud Powell, Art Tatum, and Duke Ellington.

Mingus quickly established himself as a bandleader and composer, founding his own publishing and recording companies and the Jazz Workshop, which nurtured young talent and fostered collective improvisation. His music spanned advanced bebop, avant-garde jazz, and progressive big band experiments, with seminal recordings such as Pithecanthropus Erectus, Mingus Ah Um, and The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady. Mingus was known for his volatile personality, innovative approach to composition, and his ability to blend jazz and classical idioms. He recorded over a hundred albums and wrote more than three hundred scores, leaving a lasting legacy as one of the greatest jazz composers and musicians in history.
