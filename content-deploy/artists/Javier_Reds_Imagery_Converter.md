## Biography
Javier Red is a Mexican-born pianist and composer, recognized for his innovative contributions to the free jazz and avant-garde scenes. Raised in Mexico City, Red was exposed early to a rich musical environment, with his father playing Stravinsky's 'Rite of Spring' and the boleros and popular music of his youth shaping his formative years. In his twenties, Red gravitated toward jazz, particularly inspired by the ECM label's atmospheric sound and pianists like Keith Jarrett and John Taylor, with whom he later studied. Seeking to deepen his understanding of jazz, he took lessons from Bill Carrothers in New York, who encouraged him to immerse himself in the bebop tradition by studying Charlie Parker.[1][7]

After years as a working musician in Mexico, Red moved to Chicago in 2015, where he formed his quartet, Imagery Converter. The group, featuring Gustavo Cortiñas (drums), Jake Wark (tenor sax), and Ben Dillinger (bass), debuted with 'Ephemeral Certainties' (Delmark, 2019) and followed with 'Life & Umbrella' (Desafio Candente, 2023). Red’s compositions are marked by complex, shifting structures and a prismatic approach to rhythm and harmony, often reflecting personal themes—most notably, his experiences as the father of an autistic son. His music seeks to foster empathy and understanding for neurodiversity, using intricate musical forms to mirror the inner worlds of those under the 'umbrella' of autism.[1][2][6][10]

Red’s work with Imagery Converter has been praised for its emotional depth, technical innovation, and the seamless interplay among its members. His legacy is that of a boundary-pushing artist who bridges traditions from Latin American music to contemporary jazz, using his art to advocate for greater compassion and awareness.
