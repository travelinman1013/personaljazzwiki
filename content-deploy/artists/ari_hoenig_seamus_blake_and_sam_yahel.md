## Biography
Sam Yahel, Ari Hoenig, and Seamus Blake are renowned jazz musicians who collaborated as a quartet with guitarist Mike Moreno on the 2008 Chesky Records album *Jazz Side of the Moon*, a creative reinterpretation of Pink Floyd's *Dark Side of the Moon*, recorded in 2007 at St. Peter's Church in New York City. Sam Yahel (born 1971), a jazz pianist and Hammond B-3 organist from New York, emerged as a distinctive voice in the Hammond organ scene after moving to New York City in 1990, where he quickly established himself through collaborations with leading artists.[1][2][3] Ari Hoenig, a Philadelphia-born drummer known for his innovative and melodic approach to drumming, has earned acclaim in East Coast jazz circles for his flexible and broad-minded style.[6][7] Seamus Blake, a tenor saxophonist, joined this supergroup effort, contributing to their indie jazz sound as noted on Spotify.[context]

Their joint project exemplifies the indie jazz genre, blending organ-driven grooves, intricate drumming, dynamic guitar work, and expressive saxophone lines in a fresh take on classic rock material. Yahel's career development includes leading albums like *Searchin'* (1997) and *Truth and Beauty* (2007), alongside sideman roles with luminaries such as Norah Jones on *Come Away with Me* (2002), Joshua Redman, Bill Frisell, and others, solidifying his reputation—highlighted by top rankings in Down Beat's critics polls.[1][5] Hoenig continues to explore melodic drum possibilities through his trios and compositions, while Blake's participation underscores his role in high-caliber ensemble work. Together, they represent a snapshot of New York's vibrant jazz scene, though no extensive group biography exists beyond this recording; their individual legacies endure through ongoing performances and recordings.[1][3][8]

The quartet's low Spotify popularity (2) belies their supergroup status and critical recognition within jazz communities, contributing to the organ trio tradition's evolution and cross-genre experimentation.
