## Biography
Dread Zeppelin is an American reggae rock band formed in 1989 in Sierra Madre, California, renowned for their humorous covers of Led Zeppelin songs performed in a reggae style, sung by a Las Vegas-era Elvis Presley impersonator named Tortelvis (Greg Tortell). The band's core originated from the Pasadena group The Prime Movers, which included guitarist Jah Paul Jo (Joseph 'Severs' Ramsey), bassist Put-Mon (Gary Putman), and drummer Cheese (Curt Lichter). After The Prime Movers disbanded in 1989 following issues with Island Records, Jah Paul Jo conceived Dread Zeppelin as a novelty act, recruiting guitarist Carl Jah (Carl Haasis), Tortelvis, and percussionist Ed Zeppelin (Bryant Fernandez).[1][2][3]

Signed to I.R.S. Records in 1990, Dread Zeppelin achieved commercial success with their debut album *Un-Led-Ed*, which sold over a million copies and featured reggae versions of Led Zeppelin classics like 'Immigrant Song' and 'Black Dog,' alongside Elvis Presley and Bob Marley covers. They released several follow-up albums including *5,000,000 Tortelvis Fans Can't Be Wrong* (1991) and *It's Not Unusual* (1992) during their I.R.S. tenure, touring extensively worldwide. Lineup changes occurred, with Cheese replaced by Fresh Cheese (Paul Maselli) and shifts in instrumentation; later albums like *Hot & Spicy Beanburger* (1993) and *No Quarter Pounder* (1995) appeared on Jah Paul Jo's Birdcage Records after leaving I.R.S.[1][2]

Jah Paul Jo departed shortly after *No Quarter Pounder*, focusing on Birdcage Records, which released works by artists like Stan Ridgway and Ron Asheton; he passed away on December 29, 2014, after years of poor health. Gary Putman (Put-Mon) remains the only constant member, performing on every record and show. The band toured through 2014 and last performed live on April 2, 2016, leaving a legacy as reggae rock innovators blending hard rock, reggae, and comedy.[1][2][4]
