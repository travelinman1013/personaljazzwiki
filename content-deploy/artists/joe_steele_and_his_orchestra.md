## Biography
Joe Steele, also known as 'Professor,' was an influential jazz pianist and bandleader born around 1900, likely in Boston, though some sources list Savannah, Georgia as his birthplace. He graduated from the New England Conservatory, a prestigious institution that shaped many early jazz musicians, and quickly became active in the vibrant New York jazz scene of the 1920s. Steele began his professional career performing and recording with the Savoy Bearcats in 1926, a group central to Harlem's burgeoning jazz culture. By 1927, he was working with banjoist Henry Saparo at the Bamboo Inn in New York and soon established his own band, leading Joe Steele and His Orchestra at venues such as the Nest Club in 1929.

Steele's career was marked by collaborations with some of the era's most notable musicians. He toured with the Pike Davis Orchestra for the production 'Rhapsody In Black' in 1931–1932 and spent several years working with the legendary Chick Webb from 1932 to 1936. Steele's style was rooted in early jazz and swing, characterized by rhythmic drive and sophisticated arrangements, and he was known for his skill as both a pianist and an arranger. His recordings, including 'Coal Yard Shuffle' (1929), are valued by collectors and historians for their authentic representation of Harlem's jazz scene during its golden age.

Though not as widely recognized as some of his contemporaries, Steele's legacy endures through his recordings and the musicians he worked with. He died in New York City on February 5, 1964, leaving behind a body of work that captures a formative period in American jazz history.
