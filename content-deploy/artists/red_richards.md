## Biography
Charles Coleridge "Red" Richards was an American jazz pianist born in New York City on October 19, 1912. Growing up in Harlem, Richards was initially inspired by the stride piano tradition and began his professional career in the late 1930s, performing with bandleader Skeets Tolbert. His early immersion in the vibrant New York jazz scene allowed him to develop a robust, swinging style rooted in the classic jazz and stride idioms.

Throughout the 1940s and 1950s, Richards established himself as a versatile and in-demand pianist, performing both as a soloist and as a band member with a variety of leading jazz figures. He became particularly known for his work with Sidney Bechet, Mezz Mezzrow, and Muggsy Spanier, and later joined the bands of Wild Bill Davison and Eddie Condon. Richards was celebrated for his rhythmic drive, lyrical phrasing, and deep commitment to the traditional jazz repertoire, which he championed throughout his career.

Richards' legacy is that of a dedicated preserver of vintage jazz styles, especially stride piano, well into the late 20th century. He continued to perform and record into the 1980s, collaborating with musicians like Vic Dickenson and Johnny Williams, and remained a respected figure in the jazz community until his death in New York on March 12, 1998.
