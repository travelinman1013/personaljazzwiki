## Biography
Jethro Tull is a British rock band formed in Blackpool, Lancashire, in 1967 by Ian Anderson (born August 10, 1947, in Edinburgh, Scotland), who moved to Blackpool at age 12 and became the band's only constant member, leader, principal composer, lead vocalist, and flautist. Emerging from the British blues scene, the band started with roots in Anderson's earlier groups like The Blades and the John Evan Band (later John Evan Smash), playing blues, Motown covers, and blue-eyed soul before evolving into a quartet with guitarist Mick Abrahams, bassist Glenn Cornick, and drummer Clive Bunker. They gained traction on the London club circuit and at the 1968 Sunbury Jazz & Blues Festival, leading to their debut album *This Was* in November 1968, which showcased blues rock and jazz fusion.[1][2][4]

After Abrahams left in late 1968, Martin Barre joined as guitarist, marking a pivotal shift. The 1969 album *Stand Up*, incorporating English folk influences, became their first major success, topping the UK charts, followed by hits like 'Living in the Past' and the progressive rock-defining *Aqualung* (1971), blending hard rock, folk, and classical elements. The band underwent frequent lineup changes, including drummer Barriemore Barlow replacing Bunker, and later John Glascock on bass, producing classics like *Thick as a Brick* (1972). In the 1980s, they explored electronic rock with *Under Wraps* (1984) before returning to hard rock, winning a 1987 Grammy for *Crest of a Knave*. Known for stylistic shifts and Anderson's flute-driven stage presence, Jethro Tull has sold around 60 million albums worldwide.[2][3][4]

The band's legacy endures as one of progressive rock's most commercially successful and eccentric acts, with 11 gold and 5 platinum certifications, influencing the genre through innovative fusions despite lineup flux and challenges like Glascock's 1979 death and Anderson's throat issues. They continue touring and recording under Anderson's direction.[2][4]

## Fun Facts
- The band name Jethro Tull honors 18th-century English agriculturist and inventor Jethro Tull (1674-1741), who pioneered the seed drill; their agent suggested it after studying history.[1][5]
- Ian Anderson and Glenn Cornick were so poor in Luton that they shared one can of stew or soup each evening while Anderson worked as a cinema cleaner to pay rent.[4]
- Jethro Tull briefly tried names like Navy Blue and Bag of Blues before settling on Jethro Tull, borrowed from the inventor, which proved popular and memorable.[1]
- Their first major break came at the 1968 Sunbury Jazz & Blues Festival, where persistent touring built a grassroots following that turned the crowd rapturous.[1][4]
