## Biography
Benny Spellman (December 11, 1931 – June 3, 2011) was an American R&B singer from Pensacola, Florida, closely associated with the classic early‑1960s New Orleans rhythm and blues scene.[2][3] Raised with a strong interest in sports, his first passion was football, and he attended Southern University in Baton Rouge on a football scholarship.[1][3] While there, he began singing with a local jazz group led by clarinetist and educator Alvin Batiste (often spelled Battiste), which shifted his focus toward music.[2][3] After an army tour of duty he returned to Pensacola, and a chance 1959 encounter with Huey “Piano” Smith & the Clowns—whose truck had been wrecked in Florida—led him to drive them back to New Orleans and accept Smith’s invitation to sing with the group, effectively launching his professional career in that city’s vibrant R&B circuit.[1][2][3]

In New Orleans, Spellman quickly integrated into the scene centered around the Dew Drop Inn, where guitarist and bandleader Edgar Blanchard encouraged him onstage and club owner Frank Painia hired him as a regular vocalist.[1][3] He signed with Joe Banashak’s new Minit Records, working under young producer and songwriter Allen Toussaint, who wrote much of his material.[1][2][3] Spellman sang backing vocals on Ernie K‑Doe’s No. 1 hit “Mother‑in‑Law” and released his own 1962 single “Lipstick Traces (On a Cigarette)” with “Fortune Teller” on the B‑side, both written by Toussaint (credited as Naomi Neville); “Lipstick Traces” reached No. 28 on the U.S. Billboard R&B chart and No. 80 on the Hot 100, while “Fortune Teller” later became a much‑covered favorite by rock groups such as The Rolling Stones and The Who.[1][2] Spellman’s mellow, smoky baritone—limited in range but rich in character—was often framed by Toussaint in a pop‑leaning R&B style, and he also recorded for labels including Ace, Atlantic, Alon, Sansu and Mor‑Soul through the 1960s, working with figures such as Earl King, Mac Rebennack (Dr. John), and others.[1][2] Although he never became a major chart star, his records became staples for later Northern soul and R&B collectors, and in 1968 he left the music business to work as a public relations executive and salesman for Miller Beer.[2][3]

Spellman made an attempted comeback in the late 1980s, but a stroke curtailed further performing, and he spent his later years back in Pensacola.[2][3] His 1960s work was reissued on a 16‑track retrospective in 1988 (initially by Charly R&B, later by Collectables), helping to secure his reputation among soul aficionados.[2] In 2009 he was inducted into the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame, recognizing his role in the golden era of New Orleans R&B.[2][3] Spellman died of respiratory failure in Pensacola on June 3, 2011, at the age of 79, remembered primarily for “Lipstick Traces” and “Fortune Teller,” his distinctive baritone, and his contributions as both a featured and backing singer within the tightly knit New Orleans recording community.[1][2][3]

## Fun Facts
- Spellman’s entry into New Orleans music came from a literal roadside rescue: he met Huey "Piano" Smith & the Clowns after their truck was wrecked in Florida in 1959, drove them back to New Orleans, and ended up joining the band as a singer.[1][2][3]
- Before taking music seriously, Spellman was primarily focused on football and attended Southern University on a football scholarship, only discovering his vocal talent there with Alvin Batiste’s jazz group.[1][3]
- Although “Lipstick Traces” was his charting hit, the single’s B‑side “Fortune Teller” arguably became more famous in the long run, thanks to cover versions by The Rolling Stones, The Who and other rock bands.[2]
- After leaving the music business in 1968, Spellman built a second career as a public relations executive and salesman for Miller Beer in his hometown, only briefly attempting a comeback in the late 1980s before a stroke forced him to retire from performing.[2][3]
