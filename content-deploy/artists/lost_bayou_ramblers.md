## Biography
Lost Bayou Ramblers are a Cajun band from south Louisiana founded in 1999 by brothers Louis and André Michot, who grew up immersed in traditional Cajun music through their family band Les Frères Michot.[1][3][5] Raised in the Lafayette–Broussard area, Louis first played stand‑up bass with Les Frères Michot as a teenager before taking up the fiddle at 19, while André focused on Cajun accordion and later lap steel guitar, grounding the new group in deep regional roots even as they were just beginning their own careers.[3][5] Their first gig, booked in August 1999 at Café Rue Vermilion in downtown Lafayette, was still nameless until a friend, the late Ryan Domingue, suggested “Lost Bayou Ramblers” on the way to the show, a name the brothers immediately adopted.[3][4]

From the outset, Lost Bayou Ramblers performed predominantly acoustic, old‑style Cajun music at clubs and festivals across the United States, Europe, and Canada, quickly earning critical attention with their debut album *Pilette Breakdown* on Swallow Records.[1][2] Over time the band expanded to include electric elements and additional members such as producer/bassist Korey Richey, guitarist Jonny (Johnny) Campos, drummer Eric Heigle, and later players including Bryan Webre and Kirkland Middleton, while still touring major stages like the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival and Preservation Hall.[1][2][3] Their live reputation and recordings brought significant recognition: a Grammy nomination in 2008 for *Live: A La Blue Moon* and, later, a Grammy Award for Best Regional Roots Music Album in 2017 for *Kalenda*, firmly establishing them as standard-bearers of contemporary Cajun music.[1][2][3]

Musically, Lost Bayou Ramblers are known for playing traditional Cajun repertoire and originals almost entirely in Cajun French, yet infusing it with stylistic influences from Western swing, rockabilly, and punk rock, often delivering high‑energy performances more akin to rock shows than folk revivals.[1][6][8] They have collaborated widely, from working with Violent Femmes frontman Gordon Gano—who both performed live with them and guested on their acclaimed 2012 album *Mammoth Waltz* alongside Scarlett Johansson and Dr. John—to composing an original score for the PBS documentary *Rodents of Unusual Size* and appearing in the film *American Epic Sessions*, where they recorded the landmark Cajun song “Allons à Lafayette” on a restored 1920s electrical recording system.[1][2][3] Across more than two decades and numerous releases, the band has built a legacy of revitalizing and reimagining Cajun music for new generations, helping sustain the Cajun French language and culture while pushing the genre into experimental and modern territory.[1][3][7][8]

## Fun Facts
- The band’s name “Lost Bayou Ramblers” was coined spontaneously by their friend Ryan Domingue on the drive to their very first gig at Café Rue Vermilion in Lafayette in August 1999.[3][4]
- Before founding Lost Bayou Ramblers, Louis Michot hitchhiked across eastern Canada with his grandfather’s fiddle, busking in the streets and teaching himself French, an experience that solidified his commitment to singing in Cajun French.[3][6][8]
- Lost Bayou Ramblers recorded the classic Cajun song “Allons à Lafayette” for the film *The American Epic Sessions* using a restored 1920s electrical recording system—the same type of machine that would have captured the original 1928 performance.[1]
- Their 2012 album *Mammoth Waltz*, which features guests Gordon Gano, Scarlett Johansson, and Dr. John, was later named #2 on the Times-Picayune’s list of the “Top 21 Louisiana albums of the 21st Century.”[3]
