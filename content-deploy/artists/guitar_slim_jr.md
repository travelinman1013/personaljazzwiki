## Biography
Guitar Slim Jr., born Rodney Glenn Armstrong on August 24, 1952, in New Orleans, Louisiana, is a renowned blues guitarist and singer, best known as the son of the legendary Eddie 'Guitar Slim' Jones. Despite losing his father at a young age, Armstrong was deeply immersed in New Orleans music culture, learning guitar from Huey 'Piano' Smith and earning the nickname 'Guitar Slim Jr.' from Earl King. His early years were shaped by the vibrant local blues scene, and he became a fixture on the Black New Orleans club circuit for over two decades before recording his debut album. His style blends classic blues, country blues, and soul, marked by emotive vocals and expressive guitar work that pays homage to his father's legacy while carving out his own identity.

Armstrong's debut album, 'The Story of My Life,' recorded in 1987 and released in 1988, was nominated for a Grammy in the Best Traditional Blues Album category in 1989. The album featured a mix of his father's songs and classic soul covers, showcasing his deep roots and versatility. He went on to release two more albums, 'Nothing Nice' in 1996 and 'Brought Up The Hardway' in 2010, and has remained active in the New Orleans music scene, performing at major events like the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival. Known for his charismatic stage presence and dedication to the blues tradition, Guitar Slim Jr. is regarded as an elder statesman of the local blues community.
