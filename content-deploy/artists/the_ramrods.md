## Biography
The Ramrods, better known in most historical accounts as **The Rockin’ Ramrods**, were a Boston, Massachusetts surf and garage rock band active primarily in the 1960s and early 1970s.[2][1] Formed in 1962 as **The Ramrods Four** by Boston native Bill Linnane and fellow guitarist Vin Campisi, with Bob Blake on bass and Butch Holmes on drums, they began as an instrumental surf-rock group deeply inspired by the early 1960s surf boom.[2][1] Their early work, driven by Linnane’s guitar and keyboards, fit squarely into the high‑energy instrumental style then sweeping the U.S. coasts.[1][3]

In 1963, Vin’s younger brother **Ronn Campisi** replaced Blake on bass and Bobby “Jesse” Henderson (often credited as Bob Henderson) took over on drums, solidifying what would become the group’s classic lineup.[2][1] As instrumental surf lost favor after the arrival of the Beatles and the British Invasion, the band added vocals and rebranded as **The Rockin’ Ramrods**, with Ronn handling most lead vocals while other members contributed backing and occasional lead parts.[2][1] Throughout the mid‑1960s they became one of Boston’s most popular local acts, releasing a string of 45s including the 1963 single “Jungle Call” b/w “Indian Giver,” and especially the 1964 protopunk‑leaning single **“She Lied,”** which later gained cult status among garage rock collectors.[2][1][3]

Their musical style evolved from raw, guitar‑driven surf instrumentals to a tougher, garage‑rock and later more pop‑oriented sound, and eventually to more experimental psychedelic material.[1][2][3] In 1965 producer Frank Slay signed the group, bringing in organist Scott Curtis and steering them toward organ‑centered, pop‑oriented songs, some of which he supplied.[3] The band toured nationally, opening for high‑profile American and British acts such as The Kingsmen and The Rolling Stones, and frequently headlined New England venues, especially the Surf Ballroom chain managed by Bill Spence.[1][3] In 1968, under producer Alan Lorber, they changed their recording name to **Puff** and released an album on MGM that introduced jazz, blues, and classical elements into a softer, more experimental sound, before later reverting to the Ramrods/Rockin’ Ramrods name and eventually winding down in the early 1970s.[1][3] Though they never achieved major national chart success, their body of work – particularly “She Lied” and their mid‑’60s singles – remains well regarded within garage and surf rock circles.[2][7]

## Fun Facts
- The band originally performed under the name **The Ramrods Four** and only later became widely known as The Rockin’ Ramrods before briefly shortening the name back to The Ramrods in the late 1960s.[2][1]
- Their regional popularity was strong enough that they were booked to **tour North America with The Rolling Stones** in the fall of 1965, an unusually high‑profile slot for a largely local New England act.[3]
- Under the different name **Puff**, they released a 1968 album on MGM that departed from their earlier surf and garage style, introducing jazz, blues, and classical influences into a more experimental psychedelic sound.[1][3]
- In 1971, long after their initial 1960s heyday, Ronn Campisi quietly reassembled a studio‑only version of the Ramrods to record new material with Vin Campisi, Danny McBride, Glenn Jordan, and Stu Kassner, with former drummer Bob Henderson returning as the recording engineer rather than as a performer.[1][3]
