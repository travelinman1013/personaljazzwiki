## Biography
Betty Ann Blake, born Elizabeth Ann Baldrige on April 9, 1937, in Cincinnati, Ohio, began her musical career at the age of 16 singing with local bands. She progressed to join the Ernie Rudy orchestra from 1954 to 1956 and then served as the featured vocalist with Buddy Morrow's orchestra from 1956 to 1958, which took her to clubs across the country and attracted the attention of Golden Crest Records[1][2][5]. This led to guest appearances on two songs with trumpeter John Plonsky's modern jazz quintet in 1957 and a single with Jack Zimmerman's orchestra.

After four years on the road, Blake returned to Cincinnati to join a vocal group briefly before vibes player and producer Teddy Charles approached her in 1961 to record for Bethlehem Records. Dropping 'Ann' from her name, she released her sole album, *Betty Blake Sings in a Tender Mood*, featuring top jazz musicians including Mal Waldron on piano, Zoot Sims and Roland Alexander on tenor sax, Marcus Belgrave on trumpet, Kenny Burrell on guitar, and Teddy Charles on vibes. Her style was characterized by a touching ballad delivery, strong swing on medium and uptempo tunes, direct and ungimmicky phrasing, and faithful attention to lyrics[1][2][4].

Following this debut and swansong album, Blake disappeared from the music scene, with no further recordings noted. She passed away from cancer on September 19, 2001, at age 63, leaving a small but acclaimed legacy in jazz vocals[1].
