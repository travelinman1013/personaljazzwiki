## Biography
Billie and DeDe Pierce were a celebrated New Orleans jazz and blues duo whose partnership, both musical and marital, spanned decades and left an indelible mark on the city’s traditional jazz scene. Billie Pierce (born Wilhelmina Goodson) was a pianist and vocalist who began her career playing with legendary artists such as Bessie Smith and leading bands in Alabama and New Orleans. DeDe Pierce (born Joseph LaCroix Pierce) was a Creole trumpeter, cornetist, and vocalist who learned his craft from local masters and became known for his distinctive singing and trumpet style, often incorporating Creole French repertoire.

The couple met while performing in neighboring clubs in New Orleans during the early 1930s and soon married, becoming inseparable both on and off stage. They led their own ensemble, serving as the house band at Luthjen’s Dance Hall for over two decades, and later became central figures at Preservation Hall during the New Orleans jazz revival of the 1960s. Despite significant health setbacks in the 1950s—DeDe lost his eyesight and Billie suffered a stroke—they returned to prominence, recording prolifically and touring internationally. Their music, characterized by Billie’s robust, blues-inflected piano and DeDe’s expressive trumpet and vocals, exemplified the raw, heartfelt spirit of traditional New Orleans jazz. Both passed away in New Orleans within a year of each other: DeDe in 1973 and Billie in 1974.
