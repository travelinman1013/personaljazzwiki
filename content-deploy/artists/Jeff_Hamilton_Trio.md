## Biography
The Jeff Hamilton Trio is led by acclaimed American jazz drummer Jeff Hamilton, who was born on August 4, 1953, in Richmond, Indiana. Hamilton’s early musical journey began with piano lessons, but after being inspired by legendary drummer Gene Krupa at age five, he switched to drums at eight. By his teens, he was already performing with the Earlham College jazz ensemble and later studied at Indiana University under John Von Ohlen. Hamilton’s career quickly accelerated as he joined major acts such as the New Tommy Dorsey Orchestra, Lionel Hampton’s band, Monty Alexander’s Trio, and Woody Herman’s Thundering Herd, gaining a reputation for his dynamic and technically accomplished drumming.

In the late 1970s, Hamilton became a member of the L.A. Four, recording six albums and contributing his own arrangements and compositions. He later co-founded the Clayton-Hamilton Jazz Orchestra and has been a sought-after collaborator for jazz luminaries including Ella Fitzgerald, Oscar Peterson, Ray Brown, Rosemary Clooney, Diana Krall, and the Count Basie Orchestra. The Jeff Hamilton Trio, featuring Jon Hamar on bass and Tamir Hendelman on piano, is celebrated for its swinging style, sophisticated arrangements, and Hamilton’s signature blend of subtlety and drive. The trio has released several acclaimed albums and continues to tour internationally, upholding Hamilton’s legacy as a master of swing and small-group jazz.

Hamilton’s musical style is rooted in the jazz tradition, drawing influence from big band swing and bebop, but is marked by his originality, sensitivity, and technical prowess. As both a performer and educator, he has left a significant mark on the jazz world, inspiring a new generation of drummers and musicians with his artistry and dedication.
