## Biography
Nate Smith is an American country singer and songwriter known for his gritty vocals, rock‑leaning sound, and emotionally direct storytelling. Born on September 19, 1985, in Paradise, California, he grew up in a tight‑knit small town in the Sierra Nevada foothills, where his parents encouraged a love of music and his church youth leader first pushed him to sing in front of others.[1][5][7][8] As a kid he idolized artists like Garth Brooks and Elvis and later became obsessed with ’90s rock bands such as Nirvana and Bush, influences that would eventually blend into his country style.[1][3] He learned several instruments, including piano, trumpet, and guitar (which he picked up around age 13), and after high school he played in bands and briefly pursued pop‑ and Christian‑leaning music while living in Southern California.[1][3]

At 23, Smith moved to Nashville to chase a full‑time music career, signing a recording deal with Christian label Word Records and a publishing deal (later with Sony/ATV), and opening for acts like Brett Eldredge, Eli Young Band, and X Ambassadors.[1][2][5] When his first recording deal fell through and his early career stalled, he returned to Northern California, working as an ICU and trauma nurse assistant and serving as a worship leader while privately struggling with depression.[3][5] In November 2018, the devastating Camp Fire destroyed his home in Paradise, a turning point that led him to write “One of These Days,” a tribute to his hometown that went viral on Facebook and local news, effectively relaunching his career.[1][3][4][5] Inspired by that response, he drove back to Nashville in 2020, sleeping in his car and playing bars during the pandemic; there, his song “Wildfire” exploded on TikTok, paving the way for a record deal with Sony Music Nashville and the release of his breakthrough singles “Raised Up,” “I Don’t Wanna Go to Heaven,” “World on Fire,” and “Bulletproof.”[1][2][3]

Smith’s music draws a line between modern country‑pop and classic heartland rock, pairing big choruses and heavy guitars with what critics describe as “velvet‑thunder” or “scratchy‑voiced” vocals.[1][3][6] His work mines personal themes—faith, loss, divorce, and survival—often tied back to his experiences in Paradise and the Camp Fire, which inform both his writing and public identity.[1][3][4][5] Since signing with Sony Music Nashville, he has made his Grand Ole Opry debut, appeared on major awards shows like the ACMs, and notched multi‑week No. 1s at country radio, including a 10‑week run for “World on Fire” and subsequent success with “Bulletproof,” as well as releasing his self‑titled debut and the follow‑up project “California Gold.”[1][2][3] Though still early in his mainstream career, Smith has quickly become part of country’s rock‑oriented wave, standing out as a later‑breaking artist whose life experience and resilience underpin his growing catalog and influence.[1][2][3][6]

## Fun Facts
- Smith’s house and guitar were destroyed in the 2018 Camp Fire in Paradise, California; a friend from Nashville mailed him a replacement guitar, which he used to write “One of These Days,” the song that went viral and relaunched his career.[3][4][5]
- Before his country breakthrough, Smith worked as an ICU and trauma nurse assistant and served as a worship leader, stepping away from professional music for several years.[3][5]
- He once described his early Southern California music phase as “wannabe Ryan Cabrera,” reflecting a pop‑rock style far from the gritty country sound he’s known for today.[3]
- At the Stagecoach festival, Smith performed a faithful cover of Foo Fighters’ “My Hero,” a nod to his deep roots in ’90s rock and grunge.[3]

## Musical Connections

### Mentors/Influences
- [[unnamed_church_youth_leader|Unnamed church youth leader]] - Encouraged Smith to begin performing and singing in front of others, effectively launching his interest in making music seriously. (Early church performances and youth‑group music, which led to his later songwriting.) [Adolescence (approx. late 1990s–early 2000s)]
- [[garth_brooks|Garth Brooks]] - Major stylistic and performance influence; Smith cites Brooks as his gateway to country music and admired his voice, songs, and high‑energy stagecraft. (General influence on Smith’s live approach and country storytelling rather than specific collaborations.) [Influence across Smith’s early life and career, especially formative years and ongoing.[1][2][3]]
- [[tom_petty_and_fleetwood_mac|Tom Petty and Fleetwood Mac]] - Key musical inspirations shaping Smith’s blend of heartland rock and melodic, guitar‑driven country. (Influence on the rock and soft‑rock textures heard in songs like “Sleeve” and his broader catalog.) [Cited as core influences throughout his development as a songwriter.[1][2][3]]

### Key Collaborators
- [[jonathan_smith|Jonathan Smith]] - Hit songwriter and producer who co‑wrote and helped shape Smith’s major‑label debut single “Raised Up.” (“Raised Up” and related early Sony Music Nashville material.) [Around 2021, during Smith’s major‑label debut period.[2]]
- [[avril_lavigne|Avril Lavigne]] - Pop‑rock star who joined Smith on a collaborative version of his song “Bulletproof,” bridging country and rock audiences. (“Bulletproof” (alternate version) on the EP/collection “Through the Smoke.”) [Released following his Sony Music Nashville signing, circa early–mid 2020s.[2][3]]
- [[morgan_wallen_tour_mate|Morgan Wallen (tour mate)]] - Smith has opened shows on Wallen’s tours, exposing him to large mainstream country audiences and positioning him within Nashville’s rock‑leaning country scene. (Live tour appearances, including support slots on Wallen’s tour; no documented studio collaborations.) [After release of his debut album, early–mid 2020s.[3]]
- [[cole_swindell_tour_mate|Cole Swindell (tour mate)]] - Hosted Smith as an opening act on tour, helping build his fan base on the road. (Touring support appearances; no specific studio releases together reported.) [Post‑debut album touring cycle, early–mid 2020s.[3]]

(Touring billings and live shared stages; no specific studio recordings documented.) [Early–mid 2020s, overlapping with Smith’s rapid radio success.[3]]

### Artists Influenced
- [[bailey_zimmerman|Bailey Zimmerman]] - While not a formal protégé, Zimmerman has referred to Smith affectionately, and Smith describes Zimmerman as being like his “little brother” in Nashville; Smith’s example as an older breakout artist and his rock‑inflected style contribute to the environment shaping younger singers in the same lane. (General influence through shared touring circuits and Nashville’s rock‑leaning country trend rather than direct co‑writes.) [Mid‑2020s, during overlapping chart success and awards‑season recognition.[3]]
