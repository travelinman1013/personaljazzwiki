## Biography
Lloyd Miller was born in Glendale, California in 1938 and began piano studies at the age of three, developing an early passion for jazz that would define his nearly 75-year career in music.[5] A multi-instrumentalist, educator, and multi-linguist, Miller became known for fusing jazz with international folk and classical music traditions.[3] His musical journey took him across the globe—from recording sessions in Paris with Jef Gilson and Henri Texier in the early 1960s, to founding his own East West Records while teaching at the University of Utah, to relocating to Iran where he adopted the name Kurosh Ali Khan and hosted a prime-time television show until the Iranian Revolution. Miller's uncompromising artistic vision and commitment to spiritually-oriented, morally-grounded music made him something of an outsider throughout his career, yet he remained dedicated to his mission of promoting authentic, beautiful music with a message of a better way of life.

Miller's approach to music was deeply philosophical and principled. He lived out of his car at various points in his life by choice, prioritizing his work as an itinerant musician over material comfort. His musical philosophy centered on creating work that was "beautiful but not fake and syrupy, energetic but not thumping, phony and electronically loud," drawing inspiration from spirituals and artists like Horace Silver.[1] Despite his traditionalist sensibilities, Miller remained curious about contemporary music and collaborated with modern artists, including recording with The Heliocentrics and working on modal jazz recordings for film projects. He passed away on December 27, 2024, at the age of 86, leaving behind a legacy of recordings and a reputation as a musical elder who never compromised his artistic integrity.[1]

## Fun Facts
- At age 14, Lloyd Miller walked through what was essentially wilderness to reach Eagle Rock Boulevard in Los Angeles to attend jazz performances, demonstrating his fervor for the music at a young age.[1]
- Miller intentionally lived out of his car at various points in his life to maintain his lifestyle as an itinerant musician, and he partially moved to Iran because the warm climate made automobile housing more comfortable.[1]
- Despite his traditionalist views, Miller was discovered by modern hip-hop and electronic music communities online; he was amused when rap message board fans engaged with his unfiltered musical critiques, and he even collaborated with contemporary artists like The Heliocentrics who created a tongue-in-cheek track called 'Lloyd's Diatribe' that playfully mocked his strong opinions.[1]
- Miller recorded modal jazz on a grand piano at Capitol's Studio B in Los Angeles with legendary engineer Al Schmitt for consideration in director Jason Reitman's film 'The Front Runner,' demonstrating his continued engagement with high-profile projects late in his career.[1]
