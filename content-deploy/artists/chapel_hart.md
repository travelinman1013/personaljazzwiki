## Biography
Chapel Hart is a dynamic country music trio comprised of sisters Danica and Devynn Hart and their cousin Trea Swindle, hailing from Hart’s Chapel near Poplarville, Mississippi. Growing up in a tight-knit, musically rich family, the trio was surrounded by gospel and country influences, often singing together in church and at home. Their early exposure to artists like George Jones and Kenny Rogers, coupled with the rural Mississippi lifestyle, deeply shaped their musical identity and storytelling approach[1][2][5].

The group began their professional journey busking as a duo in New Orleans, performing covers and honing their harmonies on the streets. Devynn joined in 2018, solidifying the trio and prompting a shift toward original country music. Chapel Hart’s career accelerated after their appearance on 'America’s Got Talent,' where they received the coveted Group Golden Buzzer and later earned four standing ovations at their Grand Ole Opry debut[3][4]. Their sound blends traditional country with gospel undertones and Southern rock energy, earning them accolades such as CMT’s Next Women of Country and international recognition for their single 'You Can Have Him Jolene.'

Chapel Hart’s legacy is marked by their role as trailblazers for Black women in country music, breaking genre barriers and uniting audiences with their vibrant performances and heartfelt songwriting. Their infectious energy and three-part harmonies have garnered a devoted fanbase and critical acclaim, positioning them as influential voices in contemporary country music[3][4][5].
