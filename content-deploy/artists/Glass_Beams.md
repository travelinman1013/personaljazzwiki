## Biography
Glass Beams is a Melbourne-based music project founded by Indian-Australian multi-instrumentalist and producer Rajan Silva in 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic[3][2]. The genesis of Glass Beams was deeply personal, inspired by Silva's childhood memories with his father, who emigrated from India to Melbourne in the late 1970s[1][2]. A formative influence was repeatedly watching the 'Concert for George' tribute to George Harrison, which featured Indian sitar legend Ravi Shankar and his daughter Anoushka, alongside Western icons like Eric Clapton and Paul McCartney[1][2]. This experience shaped Silva's vision for Glass Beams: a fusion of Eastern and Western musical traditions, blending Indian classical, 70s disco, psychedelic rock, and contemporary electronica into a mesmerizing, genre-defying sound[4][5].

Glass Beams debuted with the EP 'Mirage' in 2021, quickly gaining traction through social media, streaming platforms, and grassroots record store support[2][3]. Their hypnotic, serpentine tracks and immersive live performances—where band members appear in ornate, bejeweled masks—have captivated audiences worldwide[3][7]. The follow-up EP 'Mahal', released in March 2024 on Ninja Tune, achieved notable chart success, entering at #5 on the Billboard Contemporary Jazz Albums chart and #13 on the Billboard Jazz Albums chart[3]. The group expanded from a solo project to a trio (and sometimes quartet for live shows), selling out venues across Europe, North America, and Asia, and earning invitations to major festivals[1][2].

Glass Beams is recognized for its unique blend of cyclical riffs, Eastern scales, krautrock-inspired polyrhythms, and cosmic instrumentation, all self-recorded and produced by Silva[4][3]. Their legacy lies in bridging cultural divides and creating a timeless, mystical soundscape that resonates with diverse audiences, while maintaining an enigmatic public persona through their masked performances and minimal media presence[3][7].
