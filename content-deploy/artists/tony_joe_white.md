## Biography
Tony Joe White, born on July 23, 1943, in Oak Grove, Louisiana, was the youngest of seven children in a family of cotton farmers. Immersed in the musical traditions of the rural South, White absorbed the sounds of blues, country, and gospel, which would later shape his distinctive 'swamp rock' style—a gritty blend of blues, country, and rock characterized by evocative storytelling and a deep, resonant voice[1][3]. His early musical experiences were informal, with family members playing guitar for entertainment, but a pivotal moment came when his brother introduced him to the blues of Lightnin' Hopkins, sparking White's lifelong passion for music[3].

White began performing at school dances and local clubs in Texas and Louisiana, eventually forming bands such as Tony White & His Combo and Tony Joe and the Mojos[3]. In 1968, he moved to Nashville and signed with Monument Records, achieving national recognition with his 1969 hit "Polk Salad Annie," which reached number eight on the Billboard Hot 100[1][2]. White's songwriting prowess was further demonstrated with "Rainy Night in Georgia," a soulful ballad that became a major hit for Brook Benton in 1970. Throughout his career, White wrote songs for and collaborated with a wide range of artists, including Tina Turner, for whom he penned "Steamy Windows" and "Undercover Agent for the Blues" in 1989[2].

White's legacy endures through his influential swamp rock sound and his impact on both American and international music scenes. His songs have been covered by artists such as Elvis Presley, Tom Jones, and Joe Bonamassa, and his evocative style has inspired generations of musicians. Known as the "Swamp Fox," White continued to perform and record until his death on October 24, 2018, in Leiper’s Fork, Tennessee, leaving behind a rich catalog of music and a lasting imprint on blues and rock[1][2].
