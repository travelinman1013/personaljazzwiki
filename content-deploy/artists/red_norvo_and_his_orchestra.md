## Biography
Red Norvo, born Kenneth Norville on March 31, 1908, in Beardstown, Illinois, began his career in Chicago with The Collegians in 1925 and played in various bands, including an all-marimba group on the vaudeville circuit. He gained prominence in the early 1930s with Paul Whiteman's orchestra, where he met his wife, jazz singer Mildred Bailey, and pioneered the use of xylophone, marimba, and vibraphone in jazz, earning the nickname 'Mr. Swing.' Norvo recorded innovative small-group sessions in 1934-1935 for Columbia, including modern pieces like 'Dance of the Octopus' and Bix Beiderbecke's 'In a Mist' with Benny Goodman on bass clarinet.[1][2][5]

From 1936 to 1942, Norvo led a swing orchestra for ARC labels (Brunswick, Vocalion, Columbia), featuring elegant arrangements by Eddie Sauter and vocals by Mildred Bailey, creating a softer, sophisticated swing sound distinct from louder contemporaries. He switched to vibraphone in 1943, joined Benny Goodman's sextet and big band in 1945—recording with Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie—and later Woody Herman's orchestra. In 1949, facing challenges with larger groups, he formed a groundbreaking trio with vibes, guitar, and bass, initially featuring Tal Farlow and Charles Mingus, which influenced modern jazz through its interplay and harmonic exploration.[1][3][4][5]

Norvo continued performing into the 1980s with combos, Vegas engagements, and reunions like with Benny Goodman, retiring after a stroke. His pure, unchanging style transformed mallet instruments into sophisticated jazz staples, bridging swing and modern jazz with recordings that anticipated later innovations.[1][3][6]

## Fun Facts
- Norvo sold his pet pony to buy his first marimba as a child.[2]
- His 1934-1935 'Dance of the Octopus' and 'In a Mist' sessions enraged Columbia executive Jack Kapp, who tore up Norvo's contract upon hearing the modern chamber jazz.[2]
- Norvo's 1945 session boldly featured bebop pioneers Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie, despite their 'dirty words' status among swing musicians of his generation.[1]
- He introduced mallet instruments to jazz, transforming the xylophone from a vaudeville novelty into a sophisticated voice, akin to Coleman Hawkins with the tenor sax.[6]
