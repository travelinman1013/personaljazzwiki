## Biography
Conrad Herwig (born November 1, 1959, in Lawton, Oklahoma) is a New York–based jazz trombonist, bandleader, composer, arranger, and educator widely regarded as one of the leading modern voices on his instrument.[1][2][3] He spent his formative years in Hawaii, where he attended Punahou School and came under the influence of veteran trombonist Trummy Young, then went on to study at the University of North Texas, performing with the renowned One O’Clock Lab Band.[1] Herwig later completed a Bachelor of Arts in Afro-Caribbean ethnomusicology at Goddard College in Vermont and a Master of Arts in Jazz Studies at Queens College (CUNY), grounding his performance career in both bebop and hard bop traditions as well as Afro-Caribbean music.[1][3][7]

Herwig’s professional career began in the early 1980s in Clark Terry’s big band, followed by key stints with Buddy Rich, Toshiko Akiyoshi, Mel Lewis, and the Frank Sinatra Orchestra, experiences that firmly established him as a first-call big-band trombonist.[1][3][4] He soon became an in-demand small-group player as well, serving as a featured member of Joe Henderson’s Sextet, Tom Harrell’s Septet and Big Band, and Joe Lovano’s Nonet, appearing as a soloist on Lovano’s Grammy-winning album “52nd Street Themes.”[2][3] In parallel, he developed deep ties to Afro-Caribbean and Latin jazz through long-term collaborations with Eddie Palmieri, Tito Puente, Paquito D’Rivera, Michel Camilo, and Mario Bauzá’s Afro-Cuban Jazz Orchestra, leading to his acclaimed “Latin Side” series, including the Grammy-nominated “The Latin Side of Joe Henderson.”[1][2][3]

As a leader, Herwig has released more than 20 albums (over 24 by some counts), beginning with “With Every Breath” in 1987 and continuing with a stream of recordings on labels such as Ken Music, Criss Cross, and Half Note that explore hard bop, modal, and Afro-Caribbean conceptions.[1][2][3] He has been a core member and frequent musical director/arranger for the Mingus Big Band, contributing to Grammy-nominated and Grammy-winning recordings such as “Live at the Tokyo Blue Note” and “Live at the Jazz Standard,” and his work has earned multiple Grammy nominations as well as repeated recognition as #1 Jazz Trombonist in DownBeat’s Jazz Critics Poll and multiple nominations from the Jazz Journalists Association.[1][2][3] Alongside his performing career, Herwig is a professor of jazz trombone, improvisation, and composition/arranging at Rutgers University’s Mason Gross School of the Arts and a former board member of the International Trombone Association, reinforcing his legacy as both a virtuosic performer and a major educator in contemporary jazz.[2][3]
