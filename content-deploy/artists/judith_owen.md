## Biography
Judith Owen is a Welsh-born singer, songwriter, and pianist renowned for her sophisticated blend of jazz, pop, classical, blues, and musical theatre influences. Raised in London in a highly musical family—her father was a Covent Garden opera singer—Owen was immersed in classical music, ballet, and the fine arts from an early age. Her exposure to jazz icons and Broadway musicals, especially through her parents' record collection, helped shape her signature sound, which fuses classical technique with jazz sensibility and theatrical flair. 

Owen began performing professionally in London, quickly earning a regular slot at the famed Ronnie Scott’s Jazz Club. Her career has spanned over a dozen albums and international tours, with critical acclaim for her emotionally incisive lyricism and dynamic stage presence. Notable recent projects include the albums 'Come On & Get It' (2022) and 'Judith Owen Comes Alive' (2024), both of which celebrate the legacy of pioneering but often overlooked women in jazz and blues. Now based in New Orleans, Owen continues to tour globally, captivating audiences with her sultry voice, wit, and storytelling prowess.

Owen’s musical style is characterized by its eclecticism and homage to the 'unapologetic' chanteuses of the 1940s and 1950s, such as Julia Lee, Blossom Dearie, and Nellie Lutcher. Her work is recognized for reviving and reinterpreting classic jazz and blues repertoire with a contemporary, empowering twist, solidifying her legacy as both a torchbearer and innovator in vocal jazz.
