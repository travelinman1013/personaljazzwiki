## Biography
Steven Demetre Georgiou, born on July 21, 1948, in London, England, began his musical journey as a teenager inspired by the Beatles, folk, and American blues, writing songs and achieving early success with his debut single 'I Love My Dog.' Adopting the stage name Cat Stevens, he rose to fame in the late 1960s and early 1970s with breakthrough folk rock albums like *Tea for the Tillerman* (1970) and *Teaser and the Firecat* (1971), blending introspective singer-songwriter lyrics with acoustic guitar-driven melodies that captured themes of spirituality, peace, and personal growth.[1][2][4] His style evolved from teen pop idol to one of the era's most influential singer-songwriters, marked by hits such as 'Matthew and Son,' 'Wild World,' and 'Father and Son.'[1][5]

In 1975, a near-death experience while swimming off Malibu—where he prayed for salvation and was carried to shore—profoundly impacted him, leading to his conversion to Islam in December 1977 after his brother gifted him a Quran. He adopted the name Yusuf Islam in 1978, auctioned his guitars for charity, and retired from secular music to focus on family, philanthropy, and Islamic education, founding a Muslim primary school in North London in 1983 and producing faith-based recordings like *The Life of the Last Prophet* (1995).[1][2][5] During this period, he dedicated himself to humanitarian relief through organizations like Muslim Aid.[2][4]

Yusuf returned to music in 2006 as Yusuf/Cat Stevens with *An Other Cup*, followed by albums like *Roadsinger* (2009) and *King of a Land* (2023), alongside projects such as *Moonshadow the Musical* (2012). Inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2014, his legacy endures as a multifaceted artist whose work bridges folk rock innovation with spiritual exploration and global charity.[1][5]
