## Biography
Injury Reserve was an experimental hip hop group formed in Tempe, Arizona, in 2012 by rappers Stepa J. Groggs (Jordan Groggs), RiTchie (Nathaniel Ritchie, also known as Ritchie With a T), and producer Parker Corey. The group began when Ritchie and Corey, introduced by mutual friends, started collaborating on solo material before Groggs joined, solidifying the trio's lineup. They quickly gained attention in the local scene by performing in unconventional venues such as friends' living rooms, leveraging word of mouth and online exposure to build a following.

Their early work included the mixtape 'Depth Chart' (2013), but they broke through with 'Live from the Dentist Office' (2015), named after the location where it was recorded—above a dentist's office. Injury Reserve became known for their innovative, genre-blurring approach, blending experimental production with introspective and energetic lyricism. Their self-titled debut album was released in 2019, followed by 'By the Time I Get to Phoenix' (2021), which pushed their sound further into avant-garde territory. The group was deeply affected by the passing of Stepa J. Groggs in June 2020, a loss mourned by fans and peers alike. Injury Reserve is remembered for their distinctive contributions to underground and alternative hip hop, influencing a new generation of artists with their boundary-pushing style.
