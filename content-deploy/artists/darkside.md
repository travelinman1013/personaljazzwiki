## Biography
DARKSIDE is an American electronic music duo formed in 2011 by Nicolás Jaar and Dave Harrington, both students at Brown University at the time. The two met through mutual collaborator Will Epstein while touring to support Jaar’s solo album 'Space Is Only Noise.' Their creative partnership began in a Berlin hotel room, where an equipment malfunction forced them to finish recording in the hallway—a moment that marked the birth of their unique sound[2][4].

The duo’s debut release, the 'Darkside EP,' arrived in November 2011 and was met with critical acclaim, earning positive reviews from outlets such as The Fader, Resident Advisor, and an 8.0 rating from Pitchfork. DARKSIDE’s first full-length album, 'Psychic' (2013), showcased their blend of downtempo, blues-inspired electronic music, and experimental rock. After a hiatus, they returned with 'Spiral' in 2021, further evolving their sound. In 2022, drummer Tlacael Esparza joined the band, and their first studio album as a trio, 'Nothing,' was released in February 2025[4].

DARKSIDE’s music is characterized by its fusion of electronic production, live instrumentation, and improvisational elements. Jaar’s atmospheric textures and Harrington’s guitar work create a sound described as "dubbed-out jazzbo junkyard fuzz" and "the closest thing to rock & roll" Jaar has ever done. Their legacy lies in their innovative approach to genre-blending and their influence on the experimental electronic and downtempo scenes[2][4].
