## Biography
The New Orleans Klezmer All Stars are a pioneering **New Orleans, Louisiana–based klezmer ensemble** that formed in the early 1990s and have remained an active performing group for more than three decades.[1][2][3] Coalescing on the Crescent City club circuit around 1991–92, the band emerged when guitarist and composer **Jonathan Freilich**, accordionist **Glenn Hartman**, and clarinetist Ben Schenck began experimenting with tunes from around the world—including swing, Caribbean material, and traditional klezmer—within the city’s dance-oriented nightlife.[1] Rooted in the centuries‑old Eastern European Jewish folk idiom, they set out to treat klezmer as living social music rather than museum folklore, absorbing the rhythmic drive and improvisational spirit of New Orleans jazz, funk, and street-parade traditions.[2][3] 

From the start, the New Orleans Klezmer All Stars built a reputation as a high‑energy dance band, playing long club sets and festivals with a lineup that typically featured reeds, accordion, guitar, bass, and drums.[1][8] Their approach blends traditional klezmer modes and melodies with second‑line grooves, rock backbeats, Afrobeat touches, and free‑wheeling collective improvisation, creating what the band has called a kind of **“Yiddish Impressionism”**—music that keeps audiences dancing while also probing deeper cultural memories.[3][6] Over the years they have released multiple recordings, toured nationally and internationally, and even collaborated with poet Andrei Codrescu on a dedicated project, helping to expand the possibilities of contemporary klezmer.[5] Their intermittent but enduring activity into the 2020s, including the 2023 album *Tipish*, has secured them a place as key innovators linking traditional Jewish music with the broader creative ferment of New Orleans.[1][3][5]

## Fun Facts
- The band’s 2023 album *Tipish* was recorded almost entirely live in a room over just two days, with most tracks captured in only two takes to preserve a raw, social‑music feel.[1]
- Early on, when the group urgently needed a drummer for a big gig, Neville Brothers drummer “Mean” Willie Green volunteered on the spot, underscoring how fluidly New Orleans musicians move between projects.[1]
- Saxophonist Ben Ellman was working as a cook when he first came to New Orleans, and he once cooked chicken for Afrobeat legend Fela Kuti; a later New Orleans Klezmer All Stars tune titled “King Fela’s Chicken Soup” playfully nods to that story and blends Afrobeat with klezmer.[1]
- By 2011 the band was already at least five records into its catalog and marked its 20th anniversary, including a sixth project made in collaboration with poet Andrei Codrescu.[5][7]

- [[traditional_eastern_european_klezmer_and_yiddish_secular_music|Traditional Eastern European klezmer and Yiddish secular music]] - They build on the centuries‑old klezmer folk tradition and the idea of klezmer as Yiddish secular, often instrumental, social music, using it as the core idiom they then stretch and rework. (Traditional tunes adapted in live sets; original compositions in klezmer style throughout their discography.) [1991–present]

### Key Collaborators
- [[jonathan_freilich|Jonathan Freilich]] - Co‑founder, guitarist, and principal composer/arranger; long‑time core member shaping the group’s sound and repertoire.

- [[glenn_hartman|Glenn Hartman]] - Co‑founder and accordionist, often described as a leader of the group; central to the band’s melodic voice and connection to traditional klezmer.

- [[mean_willie_green|“Mean” Willie Green]] - Neville Brothers drummer who stepped in when the band needed a drummer for an early major gig, exemplifying the cross‑band collaboration typical of the New Orleans scene.

### Artists Influenced
- [[galactic_via_stanton_moore_and_ben_ellman|Galactic (via Stanton Moore and Ben Ellman)]] - The New Orleans Klezmer All Stars provided the setting where drummer Stanton Moore and saxophonist Ben Ellman deepened their musical relationship; Ellman went on to become Galactic’s horn player and producer, and this constellation of collaborations is described as pivotal in Galactic’s development.
