## Biography
North Mississippi Allstars and Anders Osborne joined forces as **North Mississippi Osborne (N.M.O.)**, a collaborative project that fuses hill country blues and Southern rock with New Orleans roots, funk, and songwriter‑driven rock.[1][3][8] Anders Osborne, born May 4, 1966, in Uddevalla, Sweden, grew up obsessed with music and poetry, traveling through Europe as a teenager before arriving in New Orleans in 1986, where he immediately felt at home in the city’s rich musical culture.[2][3] He released his debut album *Doin’ Fine* in 1989 and gradually built a reputation as a powerful singer‑songwriter and guitarist, blending blues, rock, folk, and soul while becoming a fixture of the New Orleans scene.[2][3] 

The North Mississippi Allstars, formed by brothers Luther and Cody Dickinson in the late 1990s, came out of the North Mississippi hill country blues tradition, creating a modern blend of blues rock, jam‑band improvisation, and Southern roots music; their long affinity with Osborne on the road and in the studio led to the formation of N.M.O. as a formal band configuration.[1][8] In 2015 they recorded the collaborative album *Freedom & Dreams* together, capturing a sound that joined the Allstars’ earthy grooves and electric hill‑country vamps with Osborne’s emotionally charged songwriting, open‑tuned guitar work, and intense, Crazy Horse‑influenced rock sensibility.[3][8] Both live and on record, North Mississippi Osborne showcase an expansive, improvisational approach rooted in blues and Americana but open to extended jamming, dynamic shifts, and socially and emotionally direct lyrics, further cementing all of the musicians’ reputations in the modern blues‑rock and jam‑band worlds.[1][3][8]

## Fun Facts
- Anders Osborne left Sweden as a teenager with a strong case of wanderlust, traveling across Europe and arriving in the United States with almost no money—he hitchhiked from New York to New Orleans in the mid‑1980s and decided to stay permanently after falling in love with the city.[2][3]
- Osborne’s signature guitar sound comes largely from his use of open D tuning, which he adopted after hearing Joni Mitchell’s album *Blue* and realizing his fingers “just fit the tuning.”[3]
- Besides his own albums, Osborne has written songs recorded by major artists across genres, including country star Tim McGraw’s #1 hit “Watch The Wind Blow By” and cuts by Brad Paisley, Aaron Neville, Trombone Shorty, and others.[2][3]
- Osborne has been honored multiple times in New Orleans: Guitar Player magazine dubbed him “the poet laureate of Louisiana’s fertile roots music scene,” while local outlets such as Gambit Weekly and OffBeat have repeatedly named him Best Guitarist, Best Songwriter, and Entertainer of the Year, and he has appeared at Jazz Fest for roughly 35 years.[3][4][7]
