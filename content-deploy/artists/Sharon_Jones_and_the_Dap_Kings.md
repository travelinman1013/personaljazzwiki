## Biography
Sharon Lafaye Jones was born on May 4, 1956, in Augusta, Georgia, and spent her childhood summers there while being mostly raised in Brooklyn, New York. She began singing gospel in church from a young age and as a teenager in the early 1970s performed in talent shows and local funk groups. Unable to break into the recording industry initially, she supported herself with session work as an anonymous backup singer (sometimes credited as Lafaye Jones), wedding band gigs, and day jobs including armored car guard for Wells Fargo and corrections officer at Rikers Island prison.[1][2][3]
