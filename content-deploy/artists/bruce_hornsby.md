## Biography
Bruce Randall Hornsby, born November 23, 1954, in Williamsburg, Virginia, is an acclaimed American singer-songwriter and pianist whose career spans genres including rock, jazz, bluegrass, folk, and modern classical. Raised in a musically inclined family, Hornsby studied at the University of Richmond, Berklee College of Music, and graduated from the University of Miami, where he honed his skills in classical and jazz piano[2]. After early years performing in cover bands and working as a staff composer in Los Angeles, Hornsby found his voice by blending diverse American musical traditions.

In 1984, Hornsby formed Bruce Hornsby and the Range, signing with RCA Records in 1985. Their debut album, 'The Way It Is' (1986), featured the chart-topping title track, which addressed social issues like homelessness and racism, and established Hornsby’s signature style of fusing rock, jazz, and bluegrass[2][3]. The album’s success earned Hornsby and the Range a Grammy Award for Best New Artist in 1987. Hornsby’s subsequent work included collaborations with major artists and bands, notably touring with the Grateful Dead from 1990 to 1992 and contributing to Don Henley's hit 'The End of the Innocence.'

Throughout his career, Hornsby has been celebrated for his improvisational piano technique and genre-blending compositions. He has won three Grammy Awards and worked with a vast array of artists across musical styles, influencing both peers and younger musicians. His legacy is marked by adventurous collaborations, innovative songwriting, and a commitment to musical exploration[2][3].
