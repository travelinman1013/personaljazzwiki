## Biography
Slim Pickens is a contemporary singer, songwriter, guitarist, and producer based in Byron Bay, Australia, known for his distinctive musical style that blends folk, blues, and roots influences. Drawing inspiration from American folk traditions reminiscent of Woody Guthrie and Ramblin' Jack Elliott, combined with the Americana sensibilities of Ry Cooder, Pickens has developed a unique sound rooted in simpler, more authentic musical aesthetics. He has established himself as a multi-award-winning artist who has toured extensively throughout Australia and Europe, performing at festivals and venues across both continents.

Pickens has built a prolific recording career, producing ten studio albums that have gained significant airplay across multiple continents. His album 'Happy Trails' achieved notable commercial success, reaching number 2 on the Australian Blues and Roots airplay charts, while his work 'Hankering' has received airplay on the BBC, demonstrating his international reach. In recent years, he has expanded his creative control by establishing his own home recording studio on Australia's North Coast, where he continues to produce and record music. His work demonstrates a deep reverence for country music traditions, particularly evident in his tribute album to Hank Williams, which showcases both his technical proficiency across multiple instruments and his ability to assemble talented collaborators.
