## Biography
Etta Jones was born on November 5, 1928, in Aiken, South Carolina, and raised in Harlem, New York[1][2][4]. Her musical aspirations began early, inspired by radio singers and nurtured by her supportive family. At age 15, she entered Amateur Night at the Apollo Theater, where despite a nervous performance, she was hired by bandleader Buddy Johnson to fill in for his sister, Ella Johnson[1][2][4]. This opportunity launched her professional career, touring with Johnson's band and recording her first sides in 1944 with Leonard Feather, alongside jazz luminaries like Barney Bigard and Georgie Auld[1][3][4].

Jones spent the late 1940s and early 1950s performing with major jazz bands, including those led by Earl "Fatha" Hines, J.C. Heard, and others[1][3][4]. Despite her talent, she struggled for recognition and worked odd jobs while seeking a recording contract. Her breakthrough came in 1960 when Prestige Records signed her after hearing her demo tape. Her single "Don't Go to Strangers" became a major hit, selling a million copies and earning her a Grammy nomination[1][2][4]. Over the next decades, Jones recorded prolifically, especially with saxophonist Houston Person, with whom she formed a close musical partnership lasting more than 30 years[2][4].

Jones's style was marked by warmth, soulful phrasing, and a blues-influenced approach to vocal jazz. She favored the works of songwriters like Sammy Cahn, Harold Arlen, the Gershwins, and Cole Porter[1]. Though she never achieved the widespread fame of contemporaries like Billie Holiday or Dinah Washington, Jones was respected for her pure artistry and devotion to jazz. She received several honors, including the Eubie Blake Jazz Award and a Lifetime Achievement Award from the International Women in Jazz Foundation[2]. Etta Jones died on October 16, 2001, in Mount Vernon, New York, leaving behind a rich legacy of recordings and influence.
