## Biography
David Oquendo & Roswell Rudd is not a fixed band so much as a cross‑cultural partnership between Cuban guitarist/singer David Oquendo and American jazz trombonist/composer Roswell Rudd, documented most clearly on the album *El Encuentro* (Mojito Records). Their collaboration emerged in the late 1990s and early 2000s, when Rudd, long known for his work in free and avant‑garde jazz, began deepening his exploration of global musical traditions and Afro‑Cuban idioms. Rudd first became aware of Oquendo through a television documentary, and the two quickly discovered a shared interest in blending Cuban son, bolero, and Afro‑Cuban rhythms with jazz harmony and improvisation.[1][4][8][9]

Rudd, born in 1935 in Sharon, Connecticut, had made his name in the 1960s New York avant‑garde scene, working with Archie Shepp, the New York Art Quartet, and many others, and later became known for wide‑ranging world‑music collaborations, including projects with Malian kora player Toumani Diabaté, Mongolian musicians, Puerto Rican cuatrista Yomo Toro, and Cuban guitarist/singer David Oquendo.[2][3][4][10] Oquendo, born in Havana, Cuba in 1958, was largely self‑taught, absorbing Afro‑Cuban rhythmic language in poor Havana neighborhoods and working as a guitarist and singer in diverse Cuban styles before establishing himself in New York’s Latin and world‑music scenes.[5][6][9] On *El Encuentro* and related performances, Oquendo’s deep knowledge of son cubano, his percussive guitar, and distinctive scat rooted in Cuban street traditions met Rudd’s expansive trombone voice and jazz sensibility, creating a hybrid that moved fluidly from pop and jazz standards to Afro‑Cuban repertoire and original pieces written for the project.[1][4][9]

Within Rudd’s career, the partnership with Oquendo represents part of his late‑career focus on "world music" dialogues, in which he treated non‑U.S. traditions as equal partners rather than coloristic add‑ons, while Oquendo gained a platform that placed Cuban vernacular styles directly in conversation with a major figure of avant‑garde jazz.[1][4][8][9] Though not as extensively documented as Rudd’s work with Archie Shepp or his global projects with Diabaté and others, the Oquendo collaboration is often singled out by Rudd’s biographers and label materials as emblematic of his commitment to cross‑cultural improvisation and of Oquendo’s skill as an "astonishing interpreter" of Cuban idioms capable of interacting on equal footing with an experimental jazz master.[4][6][9]

## Fun Facts
- Roswell Rudd reportedly first took note of David Oquendo through the television documentary "Dame la Mano" on the Sundance Channel, an example of how a cable‑TV feature helped spark a serious cross‑cultural jazz project.[9]
- Rudd was fascinated by Oquendo’s Cuban scat‑singing; he highlighted that in periods when street drumming was restricted in Cuba, singers developed intricate mouth and body percussion, a tradition he felt Oquendo embodied: "There is a lot of street in David."[1]
- By the time he worked with Oquendo, Rudd was already nicknamed "The Incredible Honk" and was celebrated for collaborations that reached from Mali to Mongolia and Puerto Rico, placing the Oquendo partnership in a global web of projects rather than a one‑off experiment.[4]
- On joint concerts, Rudd and Oquendo ranged freely from pop and jazz standards to Afro‑Cuban repertoire and specially written originals, treating genre boundaries loosely and foregrounding improvisation and rhythmic interplay.[1][4]
