## Biography
Norah Jones, born Geethali Norah Jones Shankar on March 30, 1979, in New York City, is the daughter of Indian sitar virtuoso Ravi Shankar and concert producer Sue Jones. Raised primarily by her mother in Grapevine, Texas, Jones was immersed in music from an early age, studying piano and singing in church choirs. She later attended the Booker T. Washington High School for the Performing and Visual Arts in Dallas, where she honed her jazz vocal and piano skills, before moving to New York City to pursue her musical ambitions.[1][4]

Jones’s breakthrough came with her 2002 debut album, 'Come Away With Me,' a blend of jazz, pop, country, and soul that became a global sensation, selling over 27 million copies and earning her five Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year and Best New Artist. She followed this with a string of successful albums—'Feels Like Home' (2004), 'Not Too Late' (2007), 'The Fall' (2009), and others—each expanding her sound and solidifying her reputation as a genre-defying artist. Jones has also explored collaborative projects with bands such as The Little Willies, El Madmo, and Puss N Boots, and her versatility is showcased in the compilation '…Featuring Norah Jones,' which highlights her work with artists across jazz, country, rock, and hip-hop.[1][2][3]

Jones’s musical style is characterized by her warm, smoky vocals and understated piano work, blending jazz with elements of folk, pop, and blues. Her ability to cross genres without losing her distinctive voice has influenced a generation of artists and helped revive mainstream interest in jazz-influenced pop. With over 53 million records sold worldwide and ten Grammy Awards, Jones is recognized as one of the most influential musicians of the 21st century.[1][2]
