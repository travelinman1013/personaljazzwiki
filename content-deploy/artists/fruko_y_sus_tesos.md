## Biography
Fruko y Sus Tesos is a pioneering Colombian salsa orchestra founded in 1970 in Medellín by bassist, arranger, and producer Julio Ernesto Estrada Rincón, known as **Fruko**.[5][2] Before creating the band, Fruko had already built a solid reputation at the Discos Fuentes label as a session musician and producer, and as a teen timbal player with Los Corraleros de Majagual, where he was exposed to leading Colombian tropical music and to visiting Venezuelan and Caribbean bands.[1][2] A formative trip to New York with Los Corraleros allowed him to hear and share stages with the early salsa greats—such as the Fania All-Stars scene—and convinced him that Colombia needed its own hard-edged salsa orchestra.[2][3] In 1970 he formed his first salsa group under his own name and within a year renamed it **Fruko y Sus Tesos**, a tribute to the young, disciplined, and exceptionally skilled musicians (“tesos”) who joined the project.[2][1]

From its first recordings in the early 1970s, including the debut album *Tesura*, the orchestra defined a distinctly Colombian take on salsa: raw, powerful, deeply syncopated and strongly rooted in Afro‑Caribbean and Afro‑Colombian rhythms while drawing on jazz and Caribbean dance music.[2][1] Fruko’s arrangements emphasized driving bass lines, brass riffs, and complex rhythmic figures—he famously described some of the band’s syncopation as based on equations from the *Álgebra de Baldor*—and he rotated a series of charismatic lead singers such as Wilson “Saoko” Manyoma, Piper Pimienta Díaz, and a teenage Joe Arroyo.[2] Through hits like “El Preso,” “El Ausente,” “El Caminante,” “A la memoria del muerto,” “Tania,” and “Manyoma,” Fruko y Sus Tesos helped establish salsa as a central sound of Colombian popular culture and became the first Colombian orchestra to perform at New York’s Madison Square Garden.[2] Over more than five decades and some forty-plus albums, the group has served as both a flagship salsa orchestra and a training ground for singers and instrumentalists, securing its status as one of the most influential salsa ensembles in Latin America.[1][2]

Fruko y Sus Tesos also functioned as the hub of a broader creative universe built around Fruko’s work for Discos Fuentes. While leading the orchestra, he created and directed other key Colombian tropical and salsa projects such as The Latin Brothers, Banda Bocana, Afrosound, Wganda Kenya, and La Sonora Dinamita, collectively recording thousands of tracks that expanded and modernized Colombian tropical music.[2][6] In doing so, he helped codify what is now recognized as Colombian salsa, inspiring subsequent generations of bandleaders, arrangers, and vocalists. Today, Fruko continues to front Fruko y Sus Tesos, touring, recording, and collaborating with younger artists, and is widely regarded as a cultural ambassador whose music preserves Afro‑Colombian roots while remaining central to salsa dance floors worldwide.[1][2][3]

## Fun Facts
- The name “Fruko y Sus Tesos” was chosen by Fruko about a year after forming his first orchestra; “tesos” in Colombian slang refers to highly capable, disciplined, and outstanding people, describing the young musicians in the band.[2][3]
- Fruko y Sus Tesos is often cited as the **pioneer** of Colombian salsa, with Fruko himself stating that early experimental recordings with the group made them “los pioneros de la salsa colombiana.”[3][2]
- The band’s hallmark syncopated style was so mathematically intricate that Fruko has described some of its rhythmic patterns as being based on equations from the famous math textbook *Álgebra de Baldor*.[2]
- Fruko y Sus Tesos became the **first Colombian orchestra** to perform at New York’s Madison Square Garden, symbolically bringing Colombian salsa back to one of the global capitals of the genre.[2]

### Artists Influenced

- [[younger_colombian_salsa_and_tropical_bands|Younger Colombian salsa and tropical bands]] - Because Fruko y Sus Tesos are widely regarded as pioneers of Colombian salsa, later orchestras and artists draw on their rhythmic language, arrangements, and repertoire as a template.
