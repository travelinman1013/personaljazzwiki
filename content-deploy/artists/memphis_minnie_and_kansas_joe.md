## Biography
Memphis Minnie & Kansas Joe was the name given by Columbia Records to the duo of guitarist‑vocalists **Memphis Minnie** (born Lizzie Douglas) and **Kansas Joe McCoy** (born Wilbur Joe McCoy), one of the most important country‑blues partnerships of the late 1920s and early 1930s.[5][1][2] Minnie, probably born June 3, 1897, in or near Algiers, Louisiana, grew up in the rural South, moved with her family to Walls, Mississippi, and received her first guitar as a child; by age 11 she was playing at local parties.[5][3] Restless and ambitious, she ran away to Memphis at 13 and spent her teens busking on Beale Street, developing a powerful guitar style and confident stage presence, and even toured the South with the Ringling Brothers Circus from 1916 to 1920 before returning to Memphis to perform with jug bands and small combos.[5][2][4]

Kansas Joe McCoy, born May 11, 1905, in Raymond, Mississippi, gravitated to the Memphis scene as a young man in the 1920s, singing and playing guitar while his younger brother Papa Charlie McCoy became a noted accompanist.[1] Around 1929 he partnered with Minnie—by then already a seasoned professional—and the pair married that same year.[5][4] Discovered while playing in front of a Memphis barber shop, they were brought to New York by a Columbia Records talent scout, who billed them as **“Memphis Minnie and Kansas Joe”**.[5][2] Their 1930 recording of “Bumble Bee” became a hit, and their 1929 side “When the Levee Breaks,” inspired by the 1927 Mississippi Flood, later achieved iconic status after Led Zeppelin reworked it on *Led Zeppelin IV*, keeping much of the original lyric and crediting Minnie as co‑writer.[1][7] In 1930 the couple moved to Chicago, where they became fixtures of the burgeoning urban blues scene, cutting dozens of sides that blended Delta country blues with a more urbane, city‑blues sound.[1][5][3]

The duo’s professional and personal partnership ended in the mid‑1930s—they divorced in 1934—and each went on to significant but separate careers.[5] Minnie, staying in Chicago, recorded prolifically through the 1930s and 1940s, evolving from acoustic to electric guitar and fronting small bands; she scored influential hits like “Me and My Chauffeur Blues,” “Please Set a Date,” and “In My Girlish Days,” and famously beat Big Bill Broonzy in a high‑profile cutting contest in 1933, cementing her reputation as perhaps the foremost woman in pre‑war country blues.[5][3][6] McCoy, meanwhile, formed the Harlem Hamfats with his brother and other musicians, crafting songs that bridged rural blues, jazz, and early swing; he also became a successful songwriter before his death in Chicago in 1950.[1] Together and apart, Memphis Minnie and Kansas Joe helped shape both country and urban blues, with their duet recordings—marked by Minnie's incisive guitar work, earthy vocals, and McCoy’s smooth singing—later influencing generations of blues and rock artists and securing their place in blues history.[5][1][7][9]
