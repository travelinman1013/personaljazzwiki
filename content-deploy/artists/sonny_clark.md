## Biography
Conrad Yeatis "Sonny" Clark was born on July 31, 1931, in Herminie, Pennsylvania, a small coal mining town southeast of Pittsburgh[1][2][5]. The youngest of eight children, Clark endured early family hardship, losing both parents to illness and tragedy, but found solace in music from a young age, performing in local hotels and dance bands while still in elementary school[5]. By age 15, he was already sharing the stage with Pittsburgh jazz legends at the historic Night of the Stars concert, marking him as a prodigious talent among peers such as Erroll Garner and Billy Strayhorn[5].

Clark's professional career began in earnest after a 1951 visit to California, where he joined saxophonist Wardell Gray's band and later played with bassist Oscar Pettiford[1][2]. His most formative early experience came as a sideman for bebop clarinetist Buddy DeFranco, touring the U.S. and Europe and recording five LPs between 1953 and 1956[1][2][4]. After six years on the West Coast, Clark moved to New York City in 1957, quickly becoming a sought-after accompanist for artists like Dinah Washington and Sonny Rollins, and establishing himself as a leading hard bop pianist and composer[1][3][4]. His work for Blue Note Records, including classic albums such as "Cool Struttin'," "Sonny's Crib," and "My Conception," showcased his intricate, bluesy, and melodic style, blending the innovations of Bud Powell and Thelonious Monk with his own crisp, swinging technique[1][3][4].

Despite his prolific output and collaborations with jazz luminaries such as John Coltrane, Hank Mobley, Art Farmer, and Jackie McLean, Clark struggled with drug addiction and health issues, leading to periods of inactivity[3][4]. He died from a heroin overdose on January 13, 1963, at just 31 years old[1][6]. Though commercial success eluded him during his lifetime, Sonny Clark is now regarded as the quintessential hard bop pianist, with his compositions and recordings continuing to influence generations of jazz musicians[4].
