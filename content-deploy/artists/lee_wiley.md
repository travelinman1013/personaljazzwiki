## Biography
Lee Wiley (October 9, 1908 – December 11, 1975) was born in Fort Gibson, Oklahoma and became one of the great jazz vocalists of all time.[1][2] At fifteen, she left home to pursue a singing career, initially working on Tulsa radio stations before moving to New York City in 1930. Her early influences included blues singers Bessie Smith, Clara Smith, and Ethel Waters, whose recordings she sought out in black neighborhoods.[4] In New York, she impressed bandleader Leo Reisman and joined his orchestra at the Central Park Casino, where her sultry contralto voice and intimate singing style quickly gained popularity on radio programs.[1][3] Her career was temporarily interrupted by a horseback riding accident that caused temporary blindness, but she recovered and continued performing.[1]

Wiley's most significant contribution to jazz came through her pioneering "songbook" albums, beginning in 1939 with a collection of George and Ira Gershwin numbers recorded for Liberty Music Shop Records.[1][5] This innovative approach set a trend and was followed by dedicated albums featuring the music of Cole Porter (1940), Richard Rodgers & Lorenz Hart (1940 and 1954), Harold Arlen (1943), Vincent Youmans, and Irving Berlin (1951).[1] Her interpretations of these standards became definitive versions, characterized by her respect for lyrics, emotional depth, and backing by first-rate musicians including Fats Waller, Bud Freeman, Billy Butterfield, and Eddie Condon.[2][5] In the 1950s, she recorded two standout RCA albums arranged by Ralph Burns: West of the Moon (1956) and A Touch of Blues (1957).[2]

Wiley's warm, sensuous, and somewhat smoky voice allowed her to project more emotion into her songs than most contemporaries.[2] She effectively stepped out of the limelight in the 1960s, making a brief appearance at the 1972 New York Jazz Festival before her death from colon cancer in 1975.[2] Though she merited greater fame during her lifetime, Wiley is now recognized as a pioneering jazz vocalist and a white artist embraced by both black and white musicians, comparable to contemporaries like Mildred Bailey and Bing Crosby.[7]

## Fun Facts
- At age fifteen, Wiley 'just ran away' from home to pursue her singing career, traveling through the Midwest (St. Louis and Chicago) before landing in New York City.[4]
- Wiley suffered a serious horseback riding accident that temporarily blinded her, an incident that was dramatized in a 1963 NBC-TV teleplay titled 'Something About Lee Wiley' where actress Piper Laurie portrayed her and Joy Bryan provided her singing voice.[1]
- Cole Porter was so impressed with Wiley's interpretation of his songs on her 1940 songbook album that he wrote to her: 'I can't tell you how much I like the way she sings these songs. The combination of voice and musical accompaniment is excellent.'[5]
- Wiley pioneered the concept of 'songbook' albums dedicated to individual composers, a format that became influential in jazz and popular music, with her Gershwin album (1939) rescuing many songs from obscurity.[5]
