## Biography
John Martyn, born Iain David McGeachy on 11 September 1948 in New Malden, Surrey, England, was the only son of two light opera singers. His parents divorced when he was five, and he spent much of his childhood with his grandmother in Glasgow, where he was exposed to music from an early age. At 17, he began his career playing blues and folk on the Scottish club circuit, influenced by folk singer Hamish Imlach, before moving to London clubs like Les Cousins and signing with Chris Blackwell’s Island Records in 1967. His debut album, *London Conversation*, followed that October, marking the start of a five-decade career blending folk, folk rock, jazz, blues, reggae, psychedelia, and later trip-hop across 20 studio albums.[1][2][4]

Martyn's style evolved rapidly; his 1968 album *The Tumbler* introduced jazz elements with flautist Harold McNair, while *Bless the Weather* (1971) and *Solid Air* (1973) became classics, showcasing his signature echoplex guitar effects and acoustic innovation. In 1969, he married singer Beverley Kutner, recording *Stormbringer!* with her in 1970, and collaborated with Fairport Convention members like Danny Thompson. After leaving Island in 1981 for brief stints elsewhere, including self-funding *The Apprentice*, he experimented across genres but never achieved major commercial success, spending much time touring. Albums like *One World* (1977) highlighted his liquid, introspective sound influenced by modal jazz akin to John Coltrane.[2][3][4]

Martyn's legacy endures as an uncompromising innovator whose boundary-pushing music influenced British folk-rock, though personal struggles marked his later years. He released albums into the 2000s, including trip-hop experiments on *And* (1996) and keyboard-based *Glasgow Walker* (2000), before passing in 2009, leaving a rich catalog of classics like *Bless the Weather*, *Solid Air*, and *One World*.[2][5]

## Fun Facts
- Martyn self-funded and recorded his 1990 album *The Apprentice* at Cava Studios in Glasgow after Island Records rejected the demos, proving them wrong by releasing it independently.[2]
- He pioneered the use of echoplex guitar effects, first showcased on *Bless the Weather* (1971), creating his trademark liquid, slurred sound.[2]
- In 2000's *Glasgow Walker*, Martyn abandoned guitar entirely, composing the entire album on keyboards.[5]
- His 1996 album *And* experimented with trip-hop and drum & bass on the then-trendy Independiente label.[5]
