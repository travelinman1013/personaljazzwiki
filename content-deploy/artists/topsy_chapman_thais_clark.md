## Biography
Thais Clark, born May 23, 1942, in New Orleans' Seventh Ward, grew up immersed in the city's musical culture but did not initially pursue singing. She danced and participated in plays during her youth, worked as a bartender at her father's nightclub in the 1960s and 1970s where she occasionally sang with live bands, but her professional career began at age 35 when actor Vernel Bagneris cast her in his play One Mo’ Time, a tribute to 1920s Black vaudeville.[1][2] Her deep, expressive voice, evoking classic blues stylists like Bessie Smith and Ma Rainey, shone in her role as Ma Reed, delivering show-stoppers such as “See See Rider” and “Muddy Water,” leading to the musical's long off-Broadway run, European tours, and a Royal Command Performance for Queen Elizabeth II.[1][2]

Clark's career flourished post-One Mo’ Time, attracting traditional jazz bands worldwide with her authentic blues and hymn delivery. She performed as a featured guest at festivals, churches, and concerts across Europe for over 20 years, at Lincoln Center, with the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra in China, the New Orleans Symphony Orchestra at Mahalia Jackson Theater, and alongside Wynton Marsalis and Dr. Michael White.[1][2] Recordings include the One Mo’ Time cast album, a solo album featuring “Horn Man Blues,” and Thais Clark & Her Palm Court Serenaders - That Old Feeling, alongside regular gigs at Palm Court Jazz Café.[1][5] Hurricane Katrina damaged her home and raised concerns about New Orleans' music scene, yet she remains a high-energy singer-dancer with over 30 years of global performances.[1][2][4]

Topsy Chapman, frequently paired with Clark in recordings and contexts like Thais Clark & Topsy Chapman New Orleans Jazz Ladies, was a revered New Orleans singer whose influence persists; a 2024 Jazz Fest tribute by her family (Solid Harmony, including Yolanda Robinson and grandson Caleb Windsay) honored her passing in November prior.[3][5] As a duo on Spotify, they represent New Orleans jazz-blues legends, though distinct careers highlight Clark's vaudeville-rooted rise and Chapman's foundational role.
