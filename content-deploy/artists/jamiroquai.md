## Biography
Jamiroquai is a pioneering British acid jazz and funk band formed in London in 1992, fronted by charismatic vocalist Jay Kay. Emerging from the vibrant London club scene, Jay Kay assembled a group of talented musicians, including keyboardist Toby Smith and didgeridoo player Wallis Buchanan, to realize his vision of a live, groove-driven sound. The band's name is a portmanteau of 'jam' and 'Iroquois,' reflecting Kay's interest in Native American philosophies and social consciousness, themes that would permeate their lyrics and public image[3][2].

Their debut single, 'When You Gonna Learn?', quickly attracted attention and led to a major contract with Sony, launching their first album, 'Emergency on Planet Earth,' to the top of the UK charts in 1993. Jamiroquai's early work was defined by acid jazz, funk, and soul influences, but over time their sound evolved to incorporate elements of rock, disco, electronic, and Latin music. The band's third album, 'Travelling Without Moving' (1996), became the best-selling funk album in history and propelled them to international fame, largely due to the innovative 'Virtual Insanity' music video, which won multiple MTV awards and a Grammy[3][2].

Despite frequent lineup changes, Jay Kay has remained the creative force behind Jamiroquai, steering the band through a prolific career that has seen them sell over 26 million albums worldwide. Their legacy is marked by a commitment to musical innovation, environmental advocacy, and a distinctive visual style, making them one of the most influential acts in the acid jazz and funk genres[3][1].
