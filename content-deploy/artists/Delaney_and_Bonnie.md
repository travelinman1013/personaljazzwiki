## Biography
Delaney & Bonnie was an influential American musical duo consisting of Delaney Bramlett and Bonnie Bramlett, both of whom brought rich musical backgrounds to their partnership. Delaney, born in Pontotoc County, Mississippi in 1939, developed his guitar skills from a young age and moved to Los Angeles in 1959, where he became a sought-after session musician and a member of the Shindogs, the house band for the TV show 'Shindig!'. Bonnie, born Bonnie Lynn O'Farrell in 1944 in Granite City, Illinois, was a prodigious singer who performed with blues legend Albert King and became the first white Ikette in the Ike & Tina Turner Revue by her mid-teens.[1][2][6]

The pair met in Los Angeles in 1967, married quickly, and soon began performing as Delaney & Bonnie. Their band, often billed as 'Delaney & Bonnie and Friends,' became renowned for its revolving lineup of top-tier musicians, including Eric Clapton, George Harrison, Duane Allman, Leon Russell, and Rita Coolidge. Their sound fused southern rock, soul, blues, gospel, and country, marked by passionate vocals and tight, groove-driven arrangements. Their debut album, 'Home,' was released on Stax Records in 1969, followed by a move to Elektra and then Atco, where they achieved greater recognition with albums like 'On Tour with Eric Clapton.'[1][2][6]

Delaney & Bonnie's collaborative spirit and genre-blending style left a lasting legacy, influencing the development of southern rock and roots music. Their work directly impacted the sound and careers of many musicians in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Though the duo divorced in 1973, both continued to contribute to music individually, and their recordings remain celebrated for their authenticity and musicianship.[1][2][6]
