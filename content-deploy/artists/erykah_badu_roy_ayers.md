## Biography
Roy Edward Ayers Jr. was born on September 10, 1940, in Los Angeles, California, into a musical family; his mother Ruby was a pianist and schoolteacher, and his father Roy Sr. played trombone.[1][5] As a child in South Central Los Angeles he was immersed in jazz and R&B, and at age five was famously given his first set of vibraphone mallets by swing-vibraphone legend Lionel Hampton after a concert, setting him on the path to the instrument that would define his career.[1] Ayers attended Thomas Jefferson High School and later Los Angeles City College, studying advanced music theory while developing as a multi‑instrumentalist on steel guitar and piano before committing to vibraphone in his late teens.[1][5]

By the early 1960s Ayers had become a professional musician, first gaining notice as a bebop and post‑bop sideman; he recorded with saxophonist Curtis Amy and released his debut album “West Coast Vibes” in 1963, produced by critic Leonard Feather for United Artists.[2][5] His major early break came when he joined flutist Herbie Mann’s band in 1966, touring internationally and recording several albums for Atlantic that helped him refine a style balancing lush harmonies, strong groove, and melodic improvisation.[2][4][5] In 1970 he moved to Manhattan and formed his band Roy Ayers Ubiquity, shifting decisively into jazz‑funk and fusion; through the 1970s he released influential albums on Verve and Polydor such as “Mystic Voyage” and “Everybody Loves the Sunshine,” and composed the acclaimed soundtrack to the 1973 blaxploitation film “Coffy.”[1][2][4][5] His smooth yet rhythmically insistent sound, full of Fender Rhodes, syncopated bass, and sunny vibraphone lines, became a touchstone for R&B, disco, and later hip‑hop.[2][5]

From the late 1970s onward Ayers broadened his reach as a bandleader, producer, and label owner, producing the group RAMP’s cult classic “Come into Knowledge,” releasing work on his own Uno Melodic label, and collaborating with Afrobeat pioneer Fela Kuti, which deepened the Afro‑diasporic polyrhythms in his music.[1][2][5] In the 1990s and 2000s his compositions were widely sampled by hip‑hop and neo‑soul artists, and he recorded with acts such as Guru on “Jazzmatazz, Vol. 1” and soul singer Erykah Badu, who called him the “Godfather” or “king” of neo‑soul and credited his mellow yet meticulous jazz‑funk fusion as a core influence on the genre.[1][3][4][6] Even into his later years Ayers toured globally, collaborated with house producers like Masters at Work and Kerri Chandler, and remained a celebrated figure whose work bridged jazz, funk, soul, and hip‑hop, influencing generations of artists until his death on March 4, 2025, at age 84.[2][3][6]

## Fun Facts
- When Roy Ayers was only five years old, vibraphone great Lionel Hampton handed him a pair of vibraphone mallets as a gift after a concert, an encounter Ayers later credited with steering him toward the instrument.[1]
- Before becoming known as a vibraphonist, Ayers first played steel guitar and piano, only taking up serious study of the vibraphone after meeting fellow vibraphonist Bobby Hutcherson at age seventeen.[1]
- Ayers composed the soundtrack to the 1973 blaxploitation film “Coffy,” starring Pam Grier; the score has since become a cult classic among soul, funk, and hip‑hop collectors.[2][5]
- Neo‑soul star Erykah Badu not only collaborated with Ayers but also publicly dubbed him the “Godfather” or “king” of neo‑soul, recognizing that his 1970s jazz‑funk sound laid the groundwork for her generation’s music.[1][3][4][6]

## Musical Connections

### Mentors/Influences
- [[lionel_hampton|Lionel Hampton]] - Early inspirational figure; gifted Ayers his first vibraphone mallets and modeled the vibraphone’s role in jazz. (Indirect influence on Ayers’s early vibraphone approach rather than specific recorded collaborations.) [Mid-1940s (Ayers’s childhood) and as a continuing stylistic reference in the 1950s–1960s.[1]]
- [[herbie_mann|Herbie Mann]] - Band leader and major career mentor; Ayers toured and recorded in Mann’s band, which launched his international career and helped him transition to leader status. (Ayers recorded several Atlantic albums under his own name produced by Mann, including “Virgo Vibes” (1967) and “Stoned Soul Picnic” (1968).) [Roughly 1966–1970 as a sideman and protégé in Mann’s group.[2][4][5]]
- [[leonard_feather|Leonard Feather]] - Jazz critic and producer who helped secure Ayers’s first record deal and produced his debut album. (Produced “West Coast Vibes” (1963) for United Artists, Ayers’s first album as a leader.) [Early 1960s, particularly around the 1963 recording and release of “West Coast Vibes.”[5]]

### Key Collaborators
- [[erykah_badu|Erykah Badu]] - Key cross‑generational collaborator in neo‑soul; she featured Ayers on her work and later appeared on his projects, publicly naming him a foundational influence. (Ayers plays vibraphone on Badu’s song “Cleva” from the album “Mama’s Gun” (2000); Badu appears on his album “Mahogany Vibe” (also known as “Mahogany Vibes,” early 2000s).) [Collaborations and mutual tributes from approximately 2000 through the 2000s.[2][5][6]]
- [[fela_kuti|Fela Kuti]] - Collaborator who brought Ayers into closer contact with Afrobeat; they recorded and performed together, blending jazz‑funk and African rhythms. (Joint projects beginning around the album “Music of Many Colors” and related performances after Ayers began collaborating with Kuti.) [Early 1980s, shortly after Ayers’s formation of Uno Melodic Records (around 1980). [1][2]]
- [[guru|Guru]] - Hip‑hop collaborator who featured Ayers on a pioneering jazz‑rap fusion project, underscoring Ayers’s importance to hip‑hop. (Ayers plays vibraphone on “Take a Look (At Yourself)” from Guru’s “Jazzmatazz Vol. 1” (1993).) [Early 1990s, particularly the 1993 recording and release of “Jazzmatazz Vol. 1.”[2]]
- [[ramp_roy_ayers_music_productions|RAMP (Roy Ayers Music Productions)]] - Group produced by Ayers, extending his sound into soul and rare groove; their work later became highly sampled. (Produced and wrote for the album “Come into Knowledge” (1977).) [Mid‑ to late 1970s, especially 1977.[2]]
- [[masters_at_work_and_kerri_chandler|Masters at Work and Kerri Chandler]] - House‑music collaborators who brought Ayers’s vibraphone and jazz‑funk sensibility into club and dance contexts. (Various singles and remixes in the 2000s and 2010s integrating Ayers’s playing and compositions into house tracks.) [2000s–2010s.[2]]

### Artists Influenced
- [[erykah_badu|Erykah Badu]] - She cited Ayers’s mellow, groove‑oriented jazz‑funk as a direct template for the sound of neo‑soul and referred to him as the “Godfather” or “king” of the genre. (Her albums “Baduizm” (1997) and “Mama’s Gun” (2000) draw on the warm, live‑band, jazz‑soul blend associated with Ayers; she later collaborated with him on “Cleva” and “Mahogany Vibe.”) [From her mid‑1990s breakthrough onward; publicly acknowledged in the 2000s.[1][3][4][6]]
- [[mary_j._blige|Mary J. Blige]] - Named by Ayers as one of the R&B artists inspired by his work, particularly his fusion of jazz, soul, and funk that prefigured modern R&B production. (Influence heard broadly in her 1990s–2000s catalog where hip‑hop‑soul often samples or references 1970s jazz‑funk aesthetics that Ayers helped define.) [1990s–2000s, as Ayers’s 1970s work became widely sampled and cited.[3][5]]
- [[eric_benét|Eric Benét]] - Cited by Ayers as an artist inspired by his approach to groove‑based, romantic soul and jazz‑inflected songwriting. (Benét’s late‑1990s and 2000s soul ballads and mid‑tempo grooves reflect the smooth, harmonic language associated with Ayers’s catalog.) [Late 1990s–2000s, concurrent with the rise of neo‑soul.[5]]
- [[a_tribe_called_quest_50_cent_tupac_ice_cube_and_broader_hiphop_community|A Tribe Called Quest, 50 Cent, Tupac, Ice Cube (and broader hip‑hop community)]] - Hip‑hop producers and MCs heavily sampled Ayers’s 1970s and 1980s recordings, making his riffs and grooves part of the DNA of golden‑age and later hip‑hop. (Numerous tracks sample songs like “Everybody Loves the Sunshine,” “Running Away,” and “Searching”; Ayers’s official bio notes influence on these artists by name.) [Late 1980s–2000s, as sampling of 1970s jazz‑funk records proliferated.[3][5][7]]
