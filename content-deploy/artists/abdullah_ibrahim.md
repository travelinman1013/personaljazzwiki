## Biography
Abdullah Ibrahim, born Adolph Johannes Brand on October 9, 1934, in Cape Town, South Africa, is widely regarded as the country's most distinguished jazz pianist and composer. Raised in the multicultural District Six, he was exposed early to a rich tapestry of musical influences, including African traditional music, Christian hymns, and American jazz. He began piano lessons at age seven and made his professional debut at fifteen, performing with local groups such as the Tuxedo Slickers. In 1958, he formed the Dollar Brand Trio, and a year later co-founded the Jazz Epistles, South Africa's first significant bebop group, alongside Kippie Moeketsi and Hugh Masekela. Their pioneering work culminated in the first jazz album recorded by South African musicians.

Facing increasing oppression under apartheid, Ibrahim left South Africa in 1962, settling in Zurich, Switzerland, where he caught the attention of Duke Ellington. Ellington produced his first international recording and facilitated his move to the United States. Ibrahim's career flourished in New York, where he performed at major venues, substituted for Ellington in his orchestra, and studied at Juilliard. His music, characterized by a blend of South African rhythms and jazz improvisation, reached a zenith with the 1974 recording of 'Mannenberg – Is Where It’s Happening,' which became an unofficial anthem of resistance for black South Africans. Throughout his career, Ibrahim has collaborated with leading jazz figures and classical ensembles, and his compositions have become central to the South African jazz canon.

Ibrahim's legacy extends beyond performance. He has been a tireless educator, founding the M7 music academy in Cape Town and initiating the Cape Town Jazz Orchestra. His influence is felt not only in jazz but also in the broader struggle for cultural identity and freedom in South Africa. Today, he continues to perform and compose, dividing his time between South Africa and abroad, and remains a vital force in global jazz.
