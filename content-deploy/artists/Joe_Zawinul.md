## Biography
Joe Zawinul was born on July 7, 1932, in Vienna, Austria. He began his career in jazz, eventually moving to the United States, where he gained prominence with saxophonist Cannonball Adderley. Zawinul's time with Adderley was marked by hits like 'Mercy, Mercy, Mercy' and 'Country Preacher.' He later collaborated with Miles Davis on albums such as 'In a Silent Way' and 'Bitches Brew,' contributing significantly to the development of jazz fusion. In 1970, Zawinul co-founded Weather Report with Wayne Shorter, a band that became a cornerstone of jazz fusion. Weather Report's innovative use of synthesizers and electronic instruments helped shape the genre. After Weather Report disbanded, Zawinul formed the Zawinul Syndicate, continuing his exploration of world music and jazz fusion. Zawinul's legacy is marked by his pioneering use of electronic instruments and his ability to blend jazz with ethnic music from around the world. He was named 'Best Electric Keyboardist' 28 times by DownBeat magazine and left an indelible mark on the jazz world before his passing on September 11, 2007.
