## Biography
Joe Farnsworth, born February 21, 1968, in South Hadley, Massachusetts, is widely recognized as one of the leading jazz drummers of his generation. Raised in a deeply musical family—his father, Roger, was a celebrated music educator and trumpeter, and his brothers John and James became professional musicians—Farnsworth was immersed in jazz from an early age. His early exposure to the music of Count Basie, John Coltrane, and Charlie Parker, as well as the drumming of Tony Williams, set him on a path toward jazz excellence. He studied with renowned drummers Alan Dawson and Arthur Taylor, both of whom shaped his technical foundation and musical approach, before earning his BMus from William Paterson College in 1990.

After relocating to New York City in the early 1990s, Farnsworth quickly became a fixture on the jazz scene, performing with legends such as Junior Cook, Cecil Payne, Harold Mabern, and George Coleman. He became known for his blazing speed, precision, and melodic sensibility on the drums, leading combos at the famed Augie’s (now Smoke Jazz & Supper Club) and collaborating with a host of jazz luminaries including Pharoah Sanders, McCoy Tyner, Cedar Walton, Diana Krall, Benny Golson, and Lou Donaldson. Farnsworth is a founding member of the One for All Quintet and has recorded over 100 albums as both leader and sideman, solidifying his reputation as one of the most recorded drummers in contemporary jazz.

Farnsworth’s musical style is rooted in the hard bop and post-bop traditions, drawing inspiration from masters like Max Roach, Roy Haynes, Elvin Jones, and Billy Higgins. His dedication to the jazz tradition and his role as an educator have made him a respected figure among peers and younger musicians alike. In 2025, his album 'The Big Room' reached the top of the JazzWeek charts, further cementing his legacy as a driving force in modern jazz drumming.
