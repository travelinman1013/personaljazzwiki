## Biography
Luther Vandross was born on April 20, 1951, in New York City, New York, where he developed an early passion for music influenced by artists like Aretha Franklin, Dionne Warwick, and the Supremes. He began his career performing at the Harlem Cultural Festival in 1969 and appearing on Sesame Street in 1969-1970, before gaining prominence as a background vocalist and arranger for artists such as David Bowie, Bette Midler, Barbra Streisand, Donna Summer, Carly Simon, and Chic.
