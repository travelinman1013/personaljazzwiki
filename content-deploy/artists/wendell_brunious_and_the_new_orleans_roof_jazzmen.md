## Biography
Wendell Brunious, born October 27, 1954, in New Orleans, Louisiana, into a prominent Louisiana Creole musical family from the Seventh Ward, began his musical journey early, singing with Chief John and the Mahogany Hall Stompers in the 1960s alongside his father, John 'Picket' Brunious Sr., a Juilliard-trained trumpeter who played with the Onward Brass Band, Young Tuxedo Brass Band, Paul Barbarin, and arranged for Cab Calloway and Billy Eckstine. Starting trumpet at age 11, he played at Paul Barbarin's funeral, studied at Southern University where he performed with Danny Barker, and made his first recording at age 9. By the mid-1970s, Brunious was performing dance music in Bourbon Street clubs, launching the first jazz brunch at Commander's Palace with guitarist Justin Adams, and substituting for his father in Albert 'Papa' French's band during Mardi Gras 1976.[1][2][3][6]

Brunious's career flourished in traditional New Orleans jazz, regularly playing at Preservation Hall from 1979 with Kid Thomas Valentine, whom he succeeded as leader in 1987 after Valentine's death; his brother John Brunious Jr. had previously led the band. He toured with Lionel Hampton in 1981, collaborated with Linda Hopkins (1984), Sammy Rimington (1984), Louis Nelson (1986-89), Eureka Brass Band (1980), and others like Michael White, Chris Barber, Papa Don Vappie, and Bob Wilber. Over a 40+ year career, he built a repertoire of over 1,500 songs spanning Louis Armstrong, Clifford Brown, the Beatles, and Burt Bacharach, also performing with Gladys Knight & the Pips and arranging for horn-heavy bands like Chicago at the Ivanhoe nightclub. In 2023, he was named Preservation Hall's first musical director, continuing as a regular performer into the 2020s.[1][2][3][4][9]

Renowned for his elegant trumpet style rooted in New Orleans brass band and traditional jazz traditions, Brunious embodies the city's musical heritage, performing with groups like the New Orleans Roof Jazzmen and New Orleans All Stars. His discography as a leader includes *In the Tradition* (1986), *Down in Honky Tonk Town* (1996), *Wendell Brunious* (1998), and *Mama Don't Allow It* (2003), with sidemen like Louis Nelson and Sammy Rimington. His legacy as a trumpet titan preserves and evolves Creole jazz, influencing generations through family ties and Preservation Hall.[1][2]
