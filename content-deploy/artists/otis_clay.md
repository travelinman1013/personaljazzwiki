## Biography
Otis Lee Clay was born on February 11, 1942, in Waxhaw, Mississippi, a small hamlet in the Mississippi Delta.[1][2] He grew up in a deeply religious environment, singing in church from an early age and absorbing the rich musical traditions of the region.[6] In 1953, Clay followed the Great Migration northward, first to Muncie, Indiana, and then to Chicago in 1956, where he immersed himself in the city's vibrant gospel music scene.[3] He joined several gospel groups including the Golden Jubilaires and the Famous Blue Jay Singers, with whom he toured the country performing spirituals and plantation melodies.[1][6]

Clay's transition to secular music began in 1965 when he signed with One-derful! Records, a Chicago label owned by George Leaner.[1] Under the mentorship of veteran soul singer Harold Burrage, Clay recorded his debut single "Flame In Your Heart," establishing himself as a distinctive voice in soul music.[7] His first major national hit came in 1967 with "That's How It Is (When You're In Love)," which reached No. 34 on the Billboard R&B chart.[4] Clay subsequently recorded for prestigious labels including Cotillion, Hi Records in Memphis (1971-1974), and Kayvette, achieving his greatest commercial success in late 1972 with "Trying to Live My Life Without You," which became his signature song and was later covered by Bob Seger.[1][2][4]

Throughout his career, Clay maintained a unique ability to balance secular and sacred music, drawing audiences at blues festivals, soul shows, and gospel concerts across America, Japan, Europe, and China.[1][2] His gospel-rooted vocal style and emotionally sincere delivery made him a favorite on the blues circuit despite not being a traditional blues singer.[2] Clay was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 2013 and continued performing until his death on January 8, 2016, at age 73 in Chicago.[3][4] His final project, the 2015 album "Soul Brothers" with Johnny Rawls, won the Blues Blast Award for Soul Album of the Year and was recognized as the number 6 Blues Album of the Year in the DownBeat Critics' Poll.[4]

## Fun Facts
- Clay initially recorded a rhythm & blues session for Columbia Records in 1962 that remained unreleased for decades, representing his secret early attempt at secular music before his public move into soul.[1]
- Despite his success in soul music, Clay experienced a spiritual awakening after recording "If I Could Reach Out (And Help Somebody)," which led him to reevaluate his career direction and return to gospel music with renewed commitment.[5]
- Clay had significant reservations about traveling to Japan in the late 1970s due to Pearl Harbor and World War II memories, but the experience completely changed his perspective and opened international touring opportunities.[5]
- Clay maintained a dual career throughout his life, successfully performing both secular soul music and sacred gospel music, a rare achievement among his contemporaries in the soul and blues genres.[2]
