## Biography
Ryan Bingham, born George Ryan Bingham on March 31, 1981, in Hobbs, New Mexico, is an American singer-songwriter and actor known for his blend of country, rock, folk, and Americana music. He grew up in a family that moved frequently across the Southwestern United States due to his father's work in the oil fields, living in towns including Bakersfield, Midland, Odessa, Houston, Laredo, and Stephenville. His mother bought him his first guitar for his 16th birthday, and he began learning to play after his parents separated when he was around 16. A family friend in Laredo taught him mariachi and Tejano music, which became his foundation for guitar playing. During his teenage years, Bingham worked as a bull rider on the rodeo circuit while traveling from town to town, and he began playing guitar and writing songs with rodeo buddies. He also worked various day jobs including construction and oil field work to support himself while pursuing music.

Bingham's early career involved playing for tips at bars across the Southwest, earning $50-100 per night—money he realized was comparable to what he made from manual labor but far more fulfilling. His debut album, "Mescalito," released in 2007, received critical acclaim for its raw and honest depiction of the American West and established him as a significant voice in country and Americana music. His breakthrough came with the song "The Weary Kind," which he co-wrote as the theme for the 2009 film "Crazy Heart" starring Jeff Bridges; the song earned him an Academy Award for Best Original Song. He continued releasing successful albums including "Junky Star" (2010), "Tomorrowland" (2012), and "American Love Song" (2019), showcasing his distinctive raspy voice and storytelling abilities.

Beyond music, Bingham has pursued acting, making his film debut in "Crazy Heart" (2009) and appearing in the independent film "A Country Called Home" (2014). Starting in 2018, he joined the cast of the Paramount Network series "Yellowstone," where he plays Walker, a character that aligns with his authentic cowboy background and musical talents. Throughout his life, Bingham has used music as a form of therapy to process personal struggles, including his parents' deaths around the time of his Oscar win and his separation from filmmaker Anna Axster after 12 years of marriage. His music reflects the world-weary, weather-beaten perspective shaped by his early experiences of hardship, homelessness, and constant movement across the American Southwest.

## Fun Facts
- Bingham was a professional bull rider on the rodeo circuit during his teenage years and early adulthood, traveling with rodeo teams across Texas before fully committing to music.
- He was homeless and living out of his truck while pursuing his music career, traveling from town to town; he later described this period as partly about running from his past and home situation rather than purely pursuing music.
- His life journey across the American Southwest mirrors the Johnny Cash song 'I've Been Everywhere,' having lived in Bakersfield, Oildale, Midland, Odessa, Kermit, Houston, Laredo, Stephenville, Austin, and Los Angeles.
- For an entire year in Stephenville, Texas, the only song Bingham knew how to play was 'La Malaguena,' a mariachi piece; he eventually taught himself additional chords and songs using a guitar chord book.
