## Biography
The Bo-Keys are a soul jazz band from Memphis, Tennessee, formed in 1998 by Scott Bomar, an Emmy Award-winning film composer and Grammy-nominated music producer. Bomar initially assembled the group as a backing band for Sir Mack Rice, a former Stax artist and songwriter, with the concept of creating an updated version of the quintessential Memphis sound that defined the city's musical legacy. The band's formation was rooted in Bomar's deep respect for Memphis's rich musical tradition, particularly the work of legendary session musicians like Charles "Skip" Pitts and Ben Cauley. In the spring of 2003, The Bo-Keys recorded their critically acclaimed debut album, *The Royal Sessions*, at Willie Mitchell's Royal Studio, establishing themselves as keepers of authentic Memphis soul and R&B.

The Bo-Keys' lineup features some of the most storied session musicians in American music history. The band includes Skip Pitts on guitar, a longtime bandleader for Isaac Hayes who played on the iconic *Shaft* soundtrack; drummer Howard Grimes from the legendary Hi Rhythm Section that backed Al Green, Ann Peebles, and Syl Johnson throughout the 1970s; keyboardist Archie "Hubbie" Turner, also a Hi Rhythm Section veteran; trumpeter and vocalist Ben Cauley, the sole survivor of the 1967 plane crash that killed Otis Redding and his Bar-Kays bandmates; and vocalist Percy Wiggins, who recorded for RCA Victor and Atco Records in the 1960s. Under Bomar's leadership, the band has become ambassadors of classic Memphis music, performing at prestigious venues including London's Barbican Performing Arts Centre, Lincoln Center's Midsummer Nights Swing Series, and The Ponderosa Stomp.

Beyond their own recordings, The Bo-Keys have contributed to major film and television projects, including performing the score for the Academy Award-winning film *Hustle and Flow* and recording "Kick It" for the Paramount/Nickelodeon animated feature *Barnyard*. The band has garnered multiple Blues Music Award nominations and maintained a prolific recording career spanning from 2004 to the present, releasing albums such as *Got to Get Back!* (2011), *Heartaches By the Number* (2016), and various EPs. Their work represents not a nostalgic recreation of the past, but rather a vital continuation of Memphis's soul and R&B tradition, blending the expertise of legendary session players with contemporary sensibilities.
