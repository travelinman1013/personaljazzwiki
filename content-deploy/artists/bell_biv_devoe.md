## Biography
Bell Biv DeVoe is an American new jack swing/R&B/hip-hop group formed in late 1988 by three members of the hugely successful Boston-based quintet New Edition: Ricky Bell (also known as Slick), Michael Bivins (also known as Biv), and Ronnie DeVoe (also known as R.D.). The trio was ages 20, 21, and 20 respectively when they decided to pursue a group project during a hiatus from New Edition, following the release of the album Heart Break. At the suggestion of producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, the three members chose to chart their own independent course rather than pursue solo careers, fundamentally reshaping the landscape of contemporary R&B and hip-hop music.

Bell Biv DeVoe achieved immediate and massive success with their 1990 debut album Poison, which hit number one on Billboard's Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, number five on the Billboard 200, and sold over four million copies. The album became a key work in pioneering the "new jack swing" sound—a revolutionary fusion of traditional soul and R&B with hip-hop beats, funk's punch, and rap's lyrical sensibility. The album was supported by two major singles: "Poison" and "Do Me!", both of which peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100. Working with producers including Teddy Riley, Bernard Belle, Jimmy Jam, Terry Lewis, and Public Enemy producers Eric Sadler and Hank and Keith Shocklee, the group created music that was "mentally hip hop, smoothed out on the R&B tip with a pop feel appeal to it." Michael Bivins played a crucial role in shaping the group's artistic direction and visual identity, bringing a street-oriented hip-hop aesthetic that contrasted sharply with New Edition's upscale suit-and-tie image.

Following their breakthrough debut, Bell Biv DeVoe released three additional albums: Hootie Mack (1993), which spawned singles including "Gangsta" and "Above The Rim"; B.B.D. (2001), which explored a more hardcore rap/R&B approach but received mixed reviews; and Three Stripes (2017). While none of these subsequent releases matched the commercial success of Poison, the group's influence on contemporary music proved enduring and profound. An entire generation of leading vocal acts—from Jodeci, Boyz II Men, and Dru Hill to Usher, Trey Songz, and Ne-Yo—followed the blueprint that Bell Biv DeVoe drafted. The group has earned numerous Grammy nominations, three American Music Awards, two Soul Train Awards, and countless Keys to the City honors throughout their career spanning more than 25 years.

## Fun Facts
- Michael Bivins served as the creative engine behind Bell Biv DeVoe's visual identity and artistic direction. Producer Hank Shocklee credited Bivins with spearheading the group's look by bringing hip-hop street aesthetics—including Timberland boots and sagging pants—which contrasted sharply with New Edition's upscale suit-and-tie image and gave the group their fresh, revolutionary appearance.
- The 'Poison' beat has achieved legendary status in popular culture. According to Vibe Magazine editor Datwon Thomas, the beat 'takes over every barbecue to this day,' demonstrating the enduring cultural impact of the 1990 single more than three decades after its release.
- Michael Bivins leveraged his experience in New Edition to become a prolific producer and talent scout. During his time away from recording, Bivins discovered and produced debut albums for multiple groups including Another Bad Creation and Boyz II Men, establishing a 'family' model of artist development that was later replicated by hip-hop producers like Dr. Dre and EPMD.
- Bell Biv DeVoe reunited with New Edition in 1996 to participate in the group's reunion and toured in support of the album Home Again on the MCA record label, demonstrating the enduring connection between the original quintet and its successful spin-off group.
