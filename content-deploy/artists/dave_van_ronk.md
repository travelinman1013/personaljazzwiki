## Biography
Dave Van Ronk (June 30, 1936 – February 10, 2002) was born in Brooklyn, New York, to a working-class family during the Great Depression. Of Irish origin, he was exposed early to jazz music and had formative experiences including a stint in the merchant marines. Initially playing tenor banjola with traditional jazz bands in New York City in the 1950s, he discovered blues records by artists like Reverend Gary Davis, Furry Lewis, and Mississippi John Hurt, shifting his focus to folk-blues by around 1958. He moved to Greenwich Village, participating in Washington Square gatherings, where he refined his fingerpicking guitar style first learned from Tom Paley of the New Lost City Ramblers and later elaborated from Reverend Gary Davis.[1][2][4]

Van Ronk rose to prominence in the Greenwich Village folk scene of the late 1950s and 1960s, earning nicknames like 'Mayor of MacDougal Street' and 'Mayor of Greenwich Village' for his avuncular presence and encyclopedic knowledge of jazz and blues. Known for his gravelly voice, ribald performances, and distinctive guitar technique blending ragtime, blues, jazz, old English ballads, gospel, and swing—including instrumental transcriptions like 'St. Louis Tickle' and 'Maple Leaf Rag'—he released his first album in 1959 on Folkways and numerous others on Prestige, performing at coffeehouses, festivals like Newport, and touring internationally. He introduced blues and jazz stylings to folk, arranged classics like Kurt Weill, and supported the scene's social-political dimensions.[1][2][3][4]

As a mentor and innovator, Van Ronk inspired emerging artists including Bob Dylan, who copied his arrangements (notably 'House of the Rising Sun'), Joni Mitchell, Phil Ochs, Tom Paxton, and Ramblin' Jack Elliott, helping launch their careers. In later years, he continued recording, touring, and teaching guitar. He received a Lifetime Achievement Award from ASCAP in 1997, and after his death in New York City, a section of Sheridan Square in Greenwich Village was named after him, cementing his legacy in American folk music revival.[1][2][4]
