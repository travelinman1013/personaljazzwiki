## Biography
Autry DeWalt Jr., known professionally as Junior Walker (born Oscar Mixon or Autry DeWalt Mixon in Blythesville, Arkansas, on June 14, 1931), developed his skills as a tenor saxophonist and vocalist in the jump blues and early R&B styles influenced by artists like Louis Jordan, Earl Bostic, and Illinois Jacquet. After moving to South Bend, Indiana, and later Battle Creek, Michigan, he formed early bands such as the Jumping Jacks and Rhythm Rockers, performing in local clubs and earning a reputation for energetic shows. Discovered by Johnny Bristol in 1961 at the El Grotto club, Walker and his group signed with Harvey Fuqua's Harvey label (later absorbed by Motown), renaming to Jr. Walker & the All Stars.[1][2][3][4]

In 1964, the band joined Motown's Soul imprint, where Berry Gordy personally produced their debut instrumentals. Their breakthrough came with 'Shotgun,' inspired by a dance Walker observed in Battle Creek; due to a no-show vocalist, Walker sang the gravelly lead vocals himself, propelling it to #1 on the R&B charts. Follow-up hits like 'Road Runner' (written by Holland-Dozier-Holland), 'Shake and Fingerpop,' 'What Does It Take (To Win Your Love),' and 'Do the Boomerang' defined their signature blend of driving R&B rhythms, fiery saxophone, strong melodies, and Walker's distinctive vocals, cementing their place in the Motown sound during the 1960s.[1][2][3][4][5]

The group continued recording with Motown into the 1970s, though hits waned after 1972. Walker pursued solo work in the disco era, collaborated with Foreigner in the 1980s, and toured with his son Autry DeWalt III on drums. The All Stars reunited briefly for the 1983 Motown 25 special. Walker passed away in 1995, leaving a legacy as a Motown staple whose raw energy influenced soul and R&B.[1][2][3]

## Fun Facts
- Motown shaved 11 years off Walker's age on records (listing 1942 instead of 1931) after 'Shotgun' success to appeal to younger audiences.[3][10]
- Walker sang lead on 'Shotgun' by accident when the intended vocalist no-showed for the session.[1][6]
- He directly called Berry Gordy on the phone to pitch 'Shotgun,' inspired by teens doing the dance in Battle Creek, Michigan, leading to an immediate late-night recording.[1][3]
- The stage name 'Walker' came from kids in South Bend calling him that because he walked everywhere, plus his stepfather's surname.[3]
