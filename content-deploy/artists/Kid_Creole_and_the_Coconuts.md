## Biography
August Darnell, born Thomas August Darnell Browder in the Bronx in 1950,  began his musical journey early, exposed to diverse musical influences in his multicultural upbringing.  His musical career started in 1965 with his brother in the band The In-Laws, followed by a brief detour into teaching English after obtaining a master's degree.  In 1974, he and his brother reformed as Dr. Buzzard's Original Savannah Band, achieving a Top 40 hit and a gold record with their self-titled debut album, which was also nominated for a Grammy.  Before forming Kid Creole and the Coconuts, Darnell produced for other artists, including Don Armando's Second Avenue Rhumba Band and Gichy Dan's Beachwood No. 9.

Darnell adopted the stage name Kid Creole in 1980, co-founding Kid Creole and the Coconuts with Andy Hernandez (Coati Mundi) and Adriana Kaegi.  Kaegi conceived the name "The Coconuts," a trio of female backing vocalists/dancers she choreographed and costumed.  Early Coconuts included Kaegi, Cheryl Lee Poirier, Fonda Rae, and Lourdes Cotton, with Lori Eastside also contributing.  The band's debut album, *Off the Coast of Me*, received critical acclaim but limited commercial success.  Their breakthrough came with *Tropical Gangsters* (retitled *Wise Guy* in the US) in 1982, which yielded several Top 10 hits in the UK and charted in the US.  Throughout the 1980s, the band's lineup included key musicians like Peter Schott, David Span, Carol Colman, and Winston Grennan, often expanding to over a dozen members with horn players and percussionists.  They collaborated with U2, providing backing vocals on their *War* album, and contributed to various film soundtracks, including *Against All Odds*.  The band also released spin-off albums featuring The Coconuts and Coati Mundi.  Kid Creole also formed Elbow Bones and the Racketeers, achieving a hit with "Night in New York."  The band's success continued with appearances at prestigious events like the Montreux Jazz Festival and private performances for Princess Diana.  A collaboration with Prince resulted in the hit single "The Sex of It."

Kid Creole and the Coconuts' music is a distinctive blend of disco, Latin American, Caribbean, and big band styles, inspired by the big band era and incorporating elements of Calloway-style performance.  Darnell's zoot suit attire and theatrical stage presence, along with the Coconuts' glamorous costumes and choreography, created a unique visual spectacle.  The band's lyrical cleverness and musical arrangements, particularly Darnell's compositional and production skills, were widely praised.  While their commercial success varied over the years, Kid Creole and the Coconuts maintained a dedicated following and continued to tour and record, even after a period of inactivity.  Their influence can be seen in subsequent artists who incorporated similar stylistic blends and theatrical elements into their performances.  The band's legacy includes a body of work that stands as a testament to Darnell's creative vision and the group's unique musical identity.
