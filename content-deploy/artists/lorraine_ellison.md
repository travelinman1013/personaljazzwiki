## Biography
Lorraine Ellison, born Marybelle Luraine Ellison on March 17, 1931, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, was a powerhouse American soul singer revered for her emotional intensity and vocal prowess. Raised in a musical family, she began singing gospel at the age of six and performed with several groups, including the Sylvania Singers, the Golden Chords, and later the Ellison Singers—a family ensemble that gained recognition in the early 1960s. Her early career was rooted in gospel, but by 1964, Ellison transitioned to secular music, signing with Mercury Records and releasing her first R&B single, 'I Dig You Baby,' in 1965.

Ellison's breakthrough came in 1966 when she recorded 'Stay With Me' for Warner Bros., a session made possible by a last-minute studio cancellation by Frank Sinatra, which left a full orchestra available for her use. The song, produced by Jerry Ragovoy, became her signature hit and is widely regarded as one of the most powerful soul performances ever recorded. Despite limited commercial success, Ellison's recordings—marked by dramatic orchestration and raw, gospel-infused vocals—earned her a devoted following among soul aficionados and fellow musicians. She continued recording through the early 1970s, collaborating with her manager Sam Bell and working with notable producers and songwriters, before her career slowed. Ellison passed away in her hometown on January 31, 1983, but her legacy endures through her influence on later generations of artists and the enduring appeal of her recordings.
