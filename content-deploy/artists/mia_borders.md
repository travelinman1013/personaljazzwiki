## Biography
Mia Borders is a celebrated singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist from New Orleans, Louisiana, known for her dynamic blend of soul, funk, rhythm and blues, and rock. Born in 1987, Borders grew up immersed in the musical culture of New Orleans, receiving her first acoustic guitar at age ten and later being inspired by her musically inclined family, including a trumpet-playing grandfather. After attending the Taft School in Connecticut, she returned home following Hurricane Katrina in 2006 and began performing professionally while studying at Loyola University, where she graduated with a degree in English.

Borders' career took off with her 2007 debut release, 'the ep,' and she quickly established herself as a powerful live performer with a reputation for electrifying shows. Her discography includes several albums such as 'Southern Fried Soul,' 'Magnolia Blue,' 'Wherever There Is,' 'Quarter-Life Crisis,' 'Fever Dreams,' and 'Good Side of Bad,' all released on her own Blaxican Records label. She is recognized for her genre-defying sound, thoughtful songwriting, and commanding stage presence, performing at major festivals and venues including the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, Essence Festival, and The Kennedy Center. Borders is also active in her community, running Third Coast Entertainment and The Borders Foundation to support marginalized artists.

Her musical style is deeply rooted in the traditions of New Orleans but is distinguished by her ability to seamlessly blend genres and infuse her work with both high-energy anthems and intimate ballads. Borders' legacy is marked by her commitment to artistic independence, her advocacy for underrepresented musicians, and her enduring influence on the New Orleans music scene.
