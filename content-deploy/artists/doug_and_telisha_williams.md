## Biography
Doug & Telisha Williams are a Nashville-based country-folk duo originally from Martinsville, Virginia, whose partnership in both music and life has shaped their distinctive sound and career. Growing up in the Blue Ridge Mountains, Doug learned music from his family elders in Galax, a region renowned for its old-time traditions, while Telisha was influenced by her uncle Sammy, a gospel singer in a family quartet. Their shared roots in Appalachian music and experiences in a small manufacturing town deeply inform their songwriting, which blends honky-tonk, Americana, and southern gothic styles[2][6].

The pair met in high school—Doug as drum major and Telisha as majorette—and after college, they reunited to pursue music together, eventually forming Wild Ponies. Over the past two decades, they have released five albums, including the acclaimed 'Galax' (2017), recorded live in Doug’s grandfather’s farm shed with both Nashville and Galax musicians, and 'Dreamers' (2024), which explores themes of queerness, polyamory, foster parenting, and fertility treatments[1][3][4]. Their live performances are celebrated for their intimacy and authenticity, often featuring acoustic sets or full-band arrangements, and they have cultivated a devoted community through their music, radio shows, and annual Trail Rides.

Doug & Telisha’s legacy lies in their ability to honor tradition while pushing boundaries, both musically and personally. Their openness about their family life and advocacy for LGBTQIA+ issues have made them influential figures in Americana and southern gothic genres, inspiring audiences and fellow musicians with their creativity, resilience, and commitment to love and community[1][4].
