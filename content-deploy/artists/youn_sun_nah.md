## Biography
Youn Sun Nah (Na Yoon-sun) is a South Korean jazz vocalist born on August 28, 1969, in Seoul, into a highly musical family, with a choirmaster/conductor father and a classical singer and musical-theater actress mother.[1][3][5] She learned piano as a child and initially focused on general studies, earning a degree in Arts from Konkuk University in 1992, and even worked in other fields before beginning to sing professionally in her early twenties, including an early engagement with the Korean Symphony Orchestra singing gospel music that led to work in musicals.[1][3] Although a stage career in musical theater was opening up, she felt uncertain about that path and decided in her mid‑twenties to pursue music in depth.

A Francophile who loved French chanson, Youn Sun Nah moved to Paris in 1995 and enrolled at the Institut National de Musique de Beauvais, the Nadia and Lili Boulanger Conservatory, and the jazz school CIM, where she shifted her focus decisively toward jazz.[1][3] There she formed an international quintet with fellow students, touring French festivals and recording several albums, gradually earning prizes at jazz competitions around 2000 and major honors such as the Grand Prix at the Jazz à Juan Concours, Korean Music Awards for Best Crossover Artist (2004) and Best Up‑and‑Coming Artist (2005), and later the French Chevalier (and subsequently Officier) des Arts et des Lettres and Korea’s Sejong Culture Prize.[1][3][2] From her early album "Reflets" (2001) through "Voyage" (2008/2009) and especially "Same Girl" (2010), she built an international reputation; "Same Girl" went gold and won major awards in France and Germany as well as in Korea, leading to appearances at top festivals (including Montreux, Montreal, and Monterey) and a performance at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics closing ceremony.[1][2]

Stylistically, Youn Sun Nah is noted for an unusually flexible, crystal‑clear voice that critics describe as dramatic, sensual, and bluesy, and for a repertoire that blurs boundaries between jazz, folk, pop, and chanson, often inflected by elements of Korean vocal tradition.[1][2][3] After early work with a French quintet and several recordings on Label Bleu, she chose greater artistic freedom, signed with ACT and later Warner Music, and released acclaimed albums such as "Voyage," "Same Girl," "Lento" (another gold record in France and Germany), "Immersion" (her Warner debut), "Waking World" (her first album of entirely original songs, written during the pandemic), and "Elles" (2024), a collection of songs associated with iconic female artists such as Nina Simone and Édith Piaf.[1][2][3] By combining virtuosic vocal technique with adventurous arrangements and an eclectic songbook, she has become one of the most prominent contemporary figures in vocal jazz, widely recognized for crossing cultural and stylistic borders while maintaining a distinctive personal sound.[1][2][6]

## Fun Facts
- She did not seriously consider becoming a singer until around age 26, when she decided to move to Paris and study jazz, despite having grown up in a musical household and already having stage experience in Korea.[1][3][4]
- Before focusing on jazz, she sang gospel with the Korean Symphony Orchestra and worked in musical theater, experiences that contributed to her dramatic stage presence and stylistic range.[1][3]
- She once turned down a multi‑album contract with the French label Label Bleu to preserve her artistic freedom before signing with the German label ACT, a decision that marked a major turning point in her international career.[1]
- On February 23, 2014, she performed at the closing ceremony of the Sochi Winter Olympics, bringing Korean jazz vocals to a global audience.[1]
