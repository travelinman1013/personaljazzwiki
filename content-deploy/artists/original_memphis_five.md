## Biography
The **Original Memphis Five** was an early New York–based jazz quintet formed in **1917** by trumpeter **Phil Napoleon** and pianist **Frank Signorelli**, who had been working together in Coney Island dance bands before organizing their own unit.[1][5] Despite the name, none of the musicians came from Memphis or the American South; the group instead took its name from W.C. Handy’s hit “Memphis Blues,” signaling their intention to market a hot, blues‑tinged jazz sound while firmly rooted in the New York dance‑band scene.[1] By the early 1920s they had settled into a classic small‑group lineup of trumpet, trombone, clarinet, piano, and drums, and quickly became one of the most **prolific white jazz bands** of the era, recording for numerous labels and, at times, even having their work issued as an Original Dixieland Jazz Band release with the blessing of ODJB leader Nick La Rocca.[1][5]

Through the 1920s the Original Memphis Five made **hundreds of records** for companies such as Victor, Columbia, Vocalion, Pathé, Banner, Arto and others, often under a variety of pseudonyms including **Ladd’s Black Aces, Jazzbo’s Carolina Serenaders, Bailey’s Lucky Seven, The Southland Six, and The Cotton Pickers**.[1][8] The group’s core sound was built on Napoleon’s bright, driving lead trumpet and Signorelli’s agile piano, framed by a flexible rhythm section and fluent clarinet and trombone lines; their records balanced concise, ensemble‑oriented arrangements with short but vivid improvised solos that made them ideal for both **dancing** and close listening.[1][6][3] Over time the band became a kind of workshop for top New York jazzmen—future stars like **Red Nichols**, **Miff Mole**, and **Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey** appeared in the lineup at various points—helping to define a crisp, technically polished, yet still hot style of small‑group jazz that bridged the gap between early New Orleans–inspired recordings and the more arranged swing styles of the 1930s.[1][3][4][6]

Although the Original Memphis Five were most active and influential in the 1920s, their legacy has extended far beyond that decade through extensive **reissues on LP and CD** and historical anthologies, including releases on **Smithsonian Folkways** that highlight their role in the evolution of small‑group jazz.[4][6] Jazz historians and collectors often point to their work as an important document of how white New York players absorbed and reshaped African American jazz and blues idioms, and as a training ground for musicians who would become central to the later swing era.[1][4][6] Modern traditional‑jazz and early‑jazz enthusiasts continue to study and reissue their recordings, keeping the band’s reputation alive as one of the most representative and influential small jazz ensembles of the 1920s.[4][6][8]

## Fun Facts
- Despite their name, none of the Original Memphis Five’s core members were from Memphis or even from the American South; the name was chosen in homage to W.C. Handy’s “Memphis Blues.”[1]
- Their very first record was issued under the name of the Original Dixieland Jazz Band, with ODJB leader Nick La Rocca’s blessing, illustrating both the marketing power of the ODJB name and the close ties between the two groups.[1]
- The band recorded under a remarkable number of pseudonyms—including Ladd’s Black Aces, Jazzbo’s Carolina Serenaders, Bailey’s Lucky Seven, The Southland Six, and The Cotton Pickers—often for the same or related labels, making their full discography unusually complex for collectors to untangle.[1][8]
- In their heyday the Original Memphis Five were so busy in New York studios that they became one of the most recorded small jazz groups of the 1920s, leaving behind hundreds of sides that document the evolution of early white jazz and dance music.[4][5][8]

- [[original_dixieland_jazz_band_nick_la_rocca|Original Dixieland Jazz Band (Nick La Rocca)]] - The Original Memphis Five’s first record was released under the Original Dixieland Jazz Band name with La Rocca’s approval, and pianist Frank Signorelli had played with ODJB, making that group an important stylistic and professional model. (Early 1920s recordings first issued as ODJB; Signorelli’s tenure with Original Dixieland Jazz Band.) [Early 1920s]

### Key Collaborators
- [[phil_napoleon|Phil Napoleon]] - Co‑founder, principal trumpeter, and long‑time leader shaping the band’s bright, driving front‑line sound and much of its repertoire. (Hundreds of sides for Victor, Columbia, Vocalion, Pathé, Banner, Arto etc., including titles like “My Honey’s Lovin’ Arms,” “Memphis Glide,” and “Meanest Blues.”) [1917–late 1920s (core period with Original Memphis Five)]
- [[frank_signorelli|Frank Signorelli]] - Co‑founder and pianist, providing harmonic foundation, arrangements, and compositions, and linking the group to the Original Dixieland Jazz Band tradition.

- [[miff_mole|Miff Mole]] - Leading New York trombonist who was an early member and frequent participant, contributing technically advanced trombone solos and ensemble work. (Numerous 1920s sides including early recordings like “My Honey’s Lovin’ Arms” and other Victor/Columbia sessions.) [Early–mid 1920s (periodic membership and sessions)]
- [[jimmy_lytell|Jimmy Lytell]] - Clarinetist in the classic Original Memphis Five lineup, adding intricate clarinet obbligatos and solos that became a hallmark of the band’s sound. (Key 1920s recordings such as “My Honey’s Lovin’ Arms” and many other quintet sides.) [Early–mid 1920s]
- [[jack_roth|Jack Roth]] - Drummer in the original quintet lineup, anchoring the band’s danceable rhythmic feel on many early recordings. (Early recordings for labels such as Arto, Pathé, and Banner including “My Honey’s Lovin’ Arms.”) [Early 1920s]
- [[red_nichols|Red Nichols]] - Star cornetist who appeared with the band from time to time, bringing his distinctive, precise lead style and further raising the ensemble’s profile in New York jazz circles. (Various sessions in the mid‑1920s (often under the Original Memphis Five name or its pseudonyms).) [1920s (occasional member/guest)]
- [[tommy_dorsey|Tommy Dorsey]] - Future swing‑era trombone star who played with the Original Memphis Five at times, contributing to the trombone chair alongside or following Miff Mole. (Selected 1920s recording and band engagements under the Original Memphis Five banner.) [1920s (periodic participation)]
- [[jimmy_dorsey|Jimmy Dorsey]] - Clarinetist and saxophonist who also spent time in the group, adding reeds to various sessions and strengthening the band’s already strong front line. (1920s sides recorded under the Original Memphis Five name and its studio pseudonyms.) [1920s (periodic participation)]

### Artists Influenced
- [[red_nichols|Red Nichols]] - Although he also worked as a collaborator, Nichols’s later small‑group recordings and his own ensembles reflected the crisp, tightly arranged yet hot style he helped refine with the Original Memphis Five. (Later Red Nichols small‑group recordings in the 1920s (e.g., his Brunswick sessions), which show continuity with the New York small‑band aesthetic associated with the Original Memphis Five.) [Mid‑late 1920s and early 1930s]
- [[tommy_and_jimmy_dorsey|Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey]] - Their experiences in the Original Memphis Five contributed to their mastery of small‑group interplay and hot dance music, which fed into the polished swing‑band language they popularized in the 1930s. (Early recording work and later big‑band recordings drawing on techniques honed in 1920s New York small groups.) [1920s (formative period) into 1930s (swing era careers)]
- [[later_traditionaljazz_and_earlyjazz_revival_bands|Later traditional‑jazz and early‑jazz revival bands]] - Reissues and historical studies of the Original Memphis Five have influenced musicians seeking to recreate or learn from authentic 1920s New York small‑group jazz styles. (Repertoire choices and performance practices on early‑jazz revival recordings that model arrangements, instrumentation, and feel on Original Memphis Five sides.) [1950s–present (revival and historical‑performance movements)]
