## Biography
Peter Martin is an acclaimed American jazz pianist, composer, arranger, and educator born on August 17, 1970, in St. Louis, Missouri.[2][8] He developed his passion for jazz during his formative years in University City, where he attended Brittany Woods Middle School and later U. City High School, which had a robust jazz program in the mid-1980s.[4] His exceptional musical talent earned him the Presidential Scholar in the Arts Award from President Ronald Reagan upon high school graduation, leading to a scholarship at the Juilliard School of Music in New York, where he honed his craft before relocating to New Orleans in 1990 to pursue a solo career.[1][4]

Throughout his professional career, Martin has established himself as a versatile performer and collaborator, touring extensively across six continents and performing at prestigious venues including the White House, where he played for President Barack Obama during a 2011 state dinner welcoming the President of China.[2][4] He gained significant recognition for his work as musical director and pianist for Grammy Award-winning artist Dianne Reeves, arranging and performing on her album *A Little Moonlight* (2003) and the soundtrack to George Clooney's film *Good Night, and Good Luck* (2005).[1][2] Beyond his performance career, Martin has held faculty positions at multiple universities including Northwestern University, Tulane University, the University of New Orleans, Jackson State University, and the New Orleans Center for Creative Arts, conducting workshops and master classes at institutions worldwide.[1][2]

Martin's most transformative contribution to music education came through his pioneering work in online jazz instruction. Beginning in 2012 while teaching at Northwestern University, he created the popular YouTube series "2-Minute Jazz," which featured innovative split-screen videos demonstrating both hand technique and musical notation.[4] This led to the founding of Open Studio in 2015, a revolutionary jazz educational platform that has attracted students from over 140 countries and features instruction from Martin alongside other renowned artists including Christian McBride, Fred Hersch, and Romero Lubambo.[1][2] His groundbreaking work in digital music education earned recognition from The New York Times, and he co-hosts the award-winning podcast "You'll Hear It" with Adam Maness, further establishing his influence in contemporary jazz discourse.[1]
