## Biography
Olodum is an Afro-Brazilian cultural group and bloco-afro founded on April 25, 1979 in the historic Pelourinho neighborhood of Salvador, Bahia, Brazil, initially as a Carnival bloco giving Black residents of Maciel‑Pelourinho a dignified, organized way to participate in Salvador’s Carnival.[1][3][4] Emerging in an area long stigmatized and historically associated with the punishment of enslaved Africans, the group quickly took on an explicit political and educational mission, using music, dance, theater, and visual symbolism to confront racism, celebrate African heritage, and teach the history of Africa and the African diaspora.[2][3][5] Its name derives from the Yoruba word “Olodumaré,” and from the outset Olodum framed its annual Carnival themes around Black pride and Pan‑African and anti‑colonial struggles, becoming one of the most visible icons of Afro‑Brazilian culture in Bahia and beyond.[2][3]

Through the 1980s, Olodum evolved from a neighborhood bloco into a professional musical ensemble, Banda Olodum, built around large percussion ensembles and a powerful new rhythm that became known as **samba‑reggae**.[2][4][6] Led by master percussionist Neguinho do Samba, the group fused traditional Bahia samba with reggae, merengue, salsa, and Afro‑Caribbean grooves, restructuring the surdo bass drums into interlocking patterns and layering repique drums in additive rhythms; this hybrid beat exploded in Bahian Carnival from 1986 onward and heavily influenced what would later be marketed as axé music.[2][3][4] Olodum’s first LP, “Egypt, Madagascar” (1987), featuring the hit “Faraó,” articulated a Pan‑African vision linking Brazil to ancient and modern African civilizations and helped carry the group from local fame to national and international stages.[1][3] Over subsequent decades, they recorded numerous albums (including the Latin Grammy‑nominated “Pela Vida”), toured extensively across Europe, the Americas, and Japan, and collaborated with global stars while maintaining a strong base in community projects, notably free percussion classes and youth programs aimed at at‑risk children in Salvador’s historic center.[1][4][5][8]

Stylistically, Olodum is defined by its massive, tightly choreographed drum corps—often over 200 percussionists—producing dense polyrhythms, call‑and‑response vocals, and melodies that blend Bahian popular music with Caribbean and diasporic influences.[2][3][6] The group’s signature Pan‑African color scheme (green, red, yellow, black, and white) and its circular logo have become globally recognizable symbols of Afro‑Brazilian pride, while affiliated projects such as the Olodum Theater Band have nurtured prominent Black Brazilian artists and revitalized cultural institutions like Salvador’s Teatro Vila Velha.[1][5] Widely credited with inventing and popularizing samba‑reggae, Olodum has influenced everything from Brazilian street carnival ensembles to international pop and rock recordings, and remains a reference point for music‑as‑activism movements that link artistic innovation to struggles against racial discrimination and social exclusion.[2][3][4][6][7][8]

## Fun Facts
- Olodum’s name comes from the Yoruba word “Olodumaré,” a term for the supreme deity, underscoring the group’s spiritual and cultural connection to African religious traditions.[2][4]
- The group’s signature logo and colors—green, red, yellow, black, and white—were consciously adopted from Pan‑African symbolism, with each color representing elements such as African forests, the blood and gold of Africa, Black pride, and a hope for world peace.[5]
- Olodum is widely credited with inventing the samba‑reggae rhythm in the mid‑1980s, a powerful fusion that became so popular it was later absorbed by trio elétrico bands and helped give rise to mainstream axé music in the 1990s.[2][3][4]
- Beyond music, Olodum created a theater troupe (the Olodum Theater Band) that helped revitalize Salvador’s historic Teatro Vila Velha and launched the careers of notable Brazilian actors such as Lázaro Ramos.[1]
