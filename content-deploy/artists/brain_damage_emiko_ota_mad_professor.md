## Biography
Brain Damage is a French dub project founded in 1999 by Martin Nathan and bassist Raphaël Talis in Saint-Étienne, France, known for over 20 years of bass-rooted dub production and experimental soundscapes[1][2][7][10]. Emiko Ota, born in Osaka, Japan, emerged in the 1980s Japanese experimental rock scene with the band OXZ (also referred to as OKZ), whose works have been reissued on labels like Captured Tracks; she has since spent a quarter century in multidisciplinary roles as a drummer, percussionist, singer, and composer in Paris and beyond, blending traditional minyo songs, psyche surf rock, children's songs, anime covers with her band KiriSaki Nin, and collaborations across underground and mainstream scenes[1][2][7]. Mad Professor, a UK-based electronic dub pioneer since the early 1980s, leads the influential Ariwa label and is renowned for innovative dub techniques, collaborations with Lee 'Scratch' Perry, and remixes for artists like Massive Attack and Sade[1].

Their collaboration 'Oide Oide,' released around 2025 on Jarring Effects, unites these artists in a 'post-dub' exploration of Japanese yōkai folklore, with Brain Damage conceiving, composing, and producing five original tracks recorded with Emiko Ota in Lyon, France, followed by Mad Professor's dub versions created in one studio session in England[1][2][5][6]. Brain Damage's meticulous, original compositions—featuring no sampling—merge experimentalism, post-punk, bass, noise-pop, electronic, trip-hop, reggae, and ambient elements with Ota's ethereal Japanese storytelling vocals inspired by yōkai like Katsura Otoko, Tenome, and Baku[1][2][3][5]. This project defies commercial norms, earning acclaim for its layered tension, arcane dubs, and cultural fusion[1][2].

The trio's legacy lies in pushing dub boundaries: Brain Damage's 'post-dub' vision, Ota's folkloric experimentalism, and Mad Professor's wizardry create immersive, otherworldly works that blend French, Japanese, and UK influences, as seen in this rarefied 10-track odyssey rated highly for its genius and strangeness[1][3].

- Brain Damage took over five months to compose and record originals with Emiko Ota, while Mad Professor completed all dubs in one studio sitting[2].
- Emiko Ota's diverse CV includes work with Rihanna, Acid Mothers Temple, and an anime cover band KiriSaki Nin alongside traditional Japanese minyo[1].
- Brain Damage defines Oide Oide as 'post-dub,' using dub techniques for entirely new music without sampling[1][2][6].
