## Biography
Robert Dwayne “Bobby” Womack (March 4, 1944 – June 27, 2014) was an American singer, songwriter, and guitarist born in Cleveland, Ohio to Friendly and Naomi Womack, a steelworker and a church organist who raised their sons in the gospel tradition.[1][3][4][7] As a child he sang and played guitar with his brothers in the Womack Brothers, a gospel group managed by their father that opened for Sam Cooke’s Soul Stirrers in the mid‑1950s, a break that led Cooke to mentor them and sign them to his SAR label.[1][3][4][5] Under Cooke’s guidance they shifted from gospel to secular R&B, renamed themselves the Valentinos, and scored R&B hits with “Lookin’ for a Love” (1962) and “It’s All Over Now” (1964), the latter cowritten by Bobby and later taken to number one in the UK by the Rolling Stones.[1][3][4]

After Cooke’s death and the dissolution of the Valentinos, Womack moved into studio and sideman work in Memphis, playing guitar at American Studios and contributing to records by artists such as Aretha Franklin, while also supplying songs to soul stars like Wilson Pickett, who cut his compositions “I’m in Love” and “I’m a Midnight Mover.”[1][4] He launched his solo career with *Fly Me to the Moon* (1968), featuring a gritty, gospel‑infused version of “California Dreamin’,” and defined his sound through early‑1970s albums such as *Communication* (1971) and *Understanding* (1972), which showcased his raspy baritone, confessional storytelling, and lean, bluesy guitar on hits like “That’s the Way I Feel About Cha,” “Woman’s Gotta Have It,” and “Harry Hippie.”[1][2][3][4] Although drug addiction and personal turmoil undercut his momentum in the mid‑1970s, he resurged with *The Poet* (1981) and *The Poet II* (1984), yielding the enduring classic “If You Think You’re Lonely Now” and duets with Patti LaBelle, and remained active into the 2000s, notably collaborating with Gorillaz on “Stylo” and releasing the acclaimed late‑career album *The Bravest Man in the Universe*.[1][2][4][5]

Womack’s musical style drew deeply from gospel, doo‑wop, and classic R&B while also embracing blues, funk, and rock, marked by a raw, conversational vocal delivery and emotionally direct lyrics that often blurred the line between secular romance and spiritual testimony.[1][4] His songs and performances influenced generations of soul and R&B singers and were widely covered and sampled, while his own work intersected with multiple eras—from early soul and Southern R&B to 1980s quiet‑storm balladry and contemporary alternative pop through his Gorillaz collaboration.[1][3][4][5] In 2009 he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, recognized as one of the most respected soul craftsmen of his time, and by the time of his death in Tarzana, California, he had left a six‑decade legacy as both a behind‑the‑scenes songwriter and a distinctive front‑line voice in American music.[1][3][4][6]

## Fun Facts
- Womack cowrote and first recorded “It’s All Over Now” with the Valentinos; when the Rolling Stones asked to cover it, he initially resisted but agreed after Sam Cooke advised him, and the Stones’ version became their first UK number one.[1][3][4]
- As a teenager performing with his brothers, Bobby would sometimes take on a mock‑preacher role onstage, a habit that earned him the nickname “Preacher” and foreshadowed the sermon‑like intensity of his later performances.[1]
- His gritty solo debut album *Fly Me to the Moon* (1968) featured a soul reimagining of “California Dreamin’” that became one of his signature early solo recordings, transforming a folk‑pop hit into a church‑inflected R&B lament.[3][4]
- After decades of struggle with drug addiction that derailed his career in the mid‑1970s, Womack achieved a late‑life resurgence, highlighted by his Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction in Cleveland in 2009 and his collaboration with Gorillaz on “Stylo,” which introduced him to a new generation of listeners.[3][4][5]
