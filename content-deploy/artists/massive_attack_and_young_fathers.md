## Biography
Massive Attack and Young Fathers are two influential groups whose collaboration represents a powerful intersection of trip hop and experimental hip hop. Massive Attack, formed in Bristol, England, in 1988 by members of the Wild Bunch collective, pioneered the trip hop genre with their atmospheric, genre-blending sound. Their debut album 'Blue Lines' (1991) is widely regarded as a foundational work in electronic music, and their subsequent releases, including 'Mezzanine' and '100th Window,' cemented their reputation for innovation and social commentary. Over the years, Massive Attack has become known for their collaborative spirit, working with a diverse range of vocalists and musicians, and for their activism, using their platform to support humanitarian causes and political awareness.[2][3][4][7]

Young Fathers, hailing from Edinburgh, Scotland, emerged in the early 2010s with a fiercely original style that fuses hip hop, pop, and experimental sounds. The trio—Kayus Bankole, Graham 'G' Hastings, and Alloysious Massaquoi—gained critical acclaim with their debut album 'Dead,' which won the 2014 Mercury Prize. Their follow-up, 'White Men Are Black Men Too,' further showcased their resistance to genre labels and their willingness to address complex social issues through music. Young Fathers are recognized for their energetic live performances and their commitment to pushing creative boundaries.[1]

The collaboration between Massive Attack and Young Fathers has produced notable works, including contributions to the 'Ritual Spirit' EP (2016) and the 2024 charity single 'Ceasefire' with Fontaines D.C., supporting Médecins Sans Frontières. Their partnership highlights a shared ethos of innovation, activism, and genre-defying artistry, making their joint projects significant within contemporary music.[2][3][4][5]
