## Biography
Darrell DeShawn Camp, known professionally as Shawn Camp, was born on August 29, 1966, and raised in a musical family in Perry County, Arkansas. A prodigy from childhood, Camp began playing guitar, mandolin, and fiddle before he could drive, often dreaming of melodies and waking up able to play them. His early musical experiences included jam sessions in the Arkansas hills, where he encountered legendary local fiddle player Sis Draper, who famously asked the young musician for his autograph and inspired him to pursue his dreams. At age 20, Camp moved to Nashville in 1987, quickly establishing himself as an outstanding multi-instrumentalist with strong vocal skills.

Camp's 30+ year career has been remarkably diverse, spanning roles as a performer, songwriter, and producer across country, bluegrass, and Americana genres. Originally signed to Reprise Records in 1993, he found early success playing in backing bands for Jerry Reed, Alan Jackson, Shelby Lynne, and Trisha Yearwood. As a songwriter, Camp achieved massive commercial success, co-writing number one hits including "Two Piña Coladas" for Garth Brooks (1998), "Nobody But Me" for Blake Shelton, and "River of Love" for George Strait. His songs have been recorded by Willie Nelson, Brooks & Dunn, Josh Turner, George Strait, and many others. More recently, he co-wrote two songs on Willie Nelson's 2023 Grammy-winning album "A Beautiful Time," including the title track.

Camp's most significant artistic relationship was his two-decade collaboration with the legendary Guy Clark, which resulted in the concept album "The Ghost of Sis Draper," released in 2025. Beginning in the late 1990s when they wrote the title track "Sis Draper" in Clark's Nashville basement workshop, the pair continued developing this passion project over decades, creating songs that blurred the lines between personal history and folklore. As a producer, Camp won Album of the Year at the American Music Awards in 2012 for "This One's for Him: A Tribute to Guy Clark," and produced Clark's 2014 Grammy-winning album "My Favorite Picture of You." He also serves as lead vocalist for the Earls of Leicester, an all-acoustic bluegrass sextet formed in 2013 to preserve the music of Flatt and Scruggs, with which he won a Grammy for Best Bluegrass Album in 2015 and was named IBMA Male Vocalist of the Year in 2017.

## Fun Facts
- Camp remembers Sis Draper arriving at a pickin' party with 'a big beehive hairdo and a fiddle in a coffin case,' and she became such an inspiration that he and Guy Clark spent over 20 years writing songs about her.
- He recorded the entire 'Ghost of Sis Draper' album in just one day at Nashville's famed Cowboy Arms Hotel and Recording Spa (now the Clement House), maintaining a cohesive sound through the immediacy of the session.
- The Earls of Leicester band name is a play on words - 'Leicester' is pronounced as 'Les-ter,' referencing bluegrass legends Lester Scruggs and Earl Flatt (Flatt and Scruggs).
- As a child, Camp would dream of melodies and wake up being able to play them, demonstrating his prodigious natural musical talent before he could even drive.
