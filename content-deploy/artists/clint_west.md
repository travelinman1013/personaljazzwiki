## Biography
Clint West, born Clinton Joseph Guillory on August 11, 1938, in Ville Platte, Louisiana, was a pioneering figure in the development of swamp pop, a genre blending Cajun, country, rhythm and blues, and rock and roll. West's early musical experiences began at age 13, playing drums and singing with the Vidrine Playboys, a local Cajun band. Despite a family not particularly musical, West was drawn to music from a young age, often preferring to listen to the radio and drum along rather than participate in sports. His first professional break came when accordionist Gilbert Mayeaux invited him to join the Vidrine Playboys after noticing his innate sense of rhythm[1][2][5].

In the late 1950s, West shifted towards swamp pop, joining Red Smiley’s Vel-Tones and recording his first single, "Lover Blues/Take a Ride." He later played with the Rollercoasters in Monroe before returning to south Louisiana to join the Boogie Kings, a blue-eyed soul group that became a regional sensation. As the front man, West's soulful vocals and leadership helped the Boogie Kings achieve widespread popularity, especially with songs like "Big Blue Diamonds" and "Try To Find Another Man." After a split in 1965, West formed the Fabulous Kings and later pursued a solo career, recording for the Jin label and performing throughout Louisiana. He was twice inducted into the Louisiana Hall of Fame, both as a solo artist and as a member of the Boogie Kings. West continued performing into the 1970s and beyond, integrating more Cajun influences into his music as his career progressed[1][2][3][4].

Clint West's legacy lies in his ability to bridge traditional Cajun roots with contemporary American genres, helping to define the swamp pop sound. His enduring popularity in Louisiana and among fans of southern soul and Cajun music is a testament to his influence and versatility. West passed away on June 28, 2016, in Opelousas, Louisiana, but his recordings and contributions to Louisiana music continue to be celebrated[3][4].
