# THE BLACK CROWES

## Quick Info

- **Origin**: Atlanta

## Biography
The Black Crowes are an American rock band formed in 1984 in Atlanta, Georgia, by brothers Chris Robinson (vocals) and Rich Robinson (guitar) while attending Walton High School in Marietta, a suburb of Atlanta. Initially named Mr. Crowe's Garden after Leonard Leslie Brooke's children's book *Johnny Crow's Garden*, the band drew influences from local acts like R.E.M., 1960s psychedelic pop, and classic Southern rock, evolving into a revivalist blues rock outfit inspired by 1970s bands. They recorded demos in the late 1980s, declined an early deal from R.E.M.'s manager, and in 1989 signed with Def American Recordings under producer George Drakoulias, who introduced them to The Faces and Humble Pie, prompting a name change to The Black Crowes and a shift to covering the Rolling Stones.[1][2][3]

Their 1990 debut album *Shake Your Money Maker* marked their breakthrough, peaking at No. 4 on the Billboard 200 with hits like the Otis Redding cover 'Hard to Handle' and 'She Talks to Angels,' blending Southern R&B crunch with cock-strutting attitude amid a landscape dominated by hair metal. The band experienced frequent lineup changes but achieved success with albums like *The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion* (1992, No. 1 debut), toured with legends like ZZ Top (from which they were fired for Chris's anti-corporate rant), AC/DC, and Aerosmith, and released ten studio albums total, selling over 35 million records. Internal conflicts, including brotherly feuds, hiatuses (2002-2005, 2011-2019), addiction, and bad deals defined their path, yet they reunited multiple times, releasing *Happiness Bastards* in 2024 and earning a 2025 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame nomination.[1][3][5]

Known for their jam band style rooted in southern rock, blues, and hard rock (Spotify genres: southern rock, jam band, rock; popularity 61), The Black Crowes' legacy endures through high-turnover lineups always centered on the Robinsons, prolific output, epic tours (e.g., with Jimmy Page), and revival of raw rock energy.[1][5][6]
