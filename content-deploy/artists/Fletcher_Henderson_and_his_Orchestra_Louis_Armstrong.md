## Biography
Fletcher Henderson and his Orchestra, featuring Louis Armstrong, played a pivotal role in shaping early jazz and big band music. Fletcher Henderson, born in Cuthbert, Georgia in 1897, was a classically trained pianist and chemist who moved to New York City and became one of the most influential bandleaders and arrangers in jazz history. His orchestra, formed in the early 1920s, was renowned for its sophisticated arrangements and for launching the careers of many jazz greats[8]. In September 1924, Louis Armstrong, already a rising star from New Orleans and Chicago, joined Henderson's band at the Roseland Ballroom in New York. Armstrong's arrival marked a turning point: his innovative trumpet solos, mastery of swing rhythm, and expressive improvisation transformed the band's sound and set new standards for jazz performance[1][2][4]. Armstrong's year with Henderson not only elevated the orchestra's reputation but also influenced the development of jazz in New York and beyond, inspiring both band members and rival musicians to embrace a more swinging, solo-driven style[1][2][3]. After leaving Henderson in late 1925, Armstrong returned to Chicago and launched his legendary solo career, but the impact of his time with Henderson reverberated through the jazz world, helping to usher in the swing era and establishing the template for big band jazz[2][4][8].
