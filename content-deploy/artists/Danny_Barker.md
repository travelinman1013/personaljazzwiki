## Biography
Danny Barker was born on January 13, 1909, in New Orleans, Louisiana, into a family deeply rooted in music. His grandfather, Isidore Barbarin, was a bandleader, and his uncles, Paul and Louis Barbarin, were drummers. Barker's early musical training included the clarinet and drums before he switched to the ukulele and banjo. He began his career with the Boozan Kings, a street band he formed, and later toured with Little Brother Montgomery. In 1930, he moved to New York City, where he transitioned to the guitar and played with notable bands like those of Lucky Millinder, Benny Carter, and Cab Calloway. During his time in New York, he frequently collaborated with his wife, singer Blue Lu Barker. In the 1960s, Barker returned to New Orleans and became pivotal in preserving jazz traditions by forming the Fairview Baptist Church Brass Band, which helped launch the careers of Wynton and Branford Marsalis. Barker's legacy extends beyond his performances; he was also a writer and composer, penning songs like 'Save the Bones for Henry Jones' and publishing books on jazz history. He passed away on March 13, 1994, at the age of 85, leaving behind a rich musical heritage. Barker's style was characterized by his Creole influences and versatility across genres such as jazz, blues, and zydeco. His contributions to jazz education and community development are still celebrated today. He was honored as a 1991 NEA Jazz Master for his contributions to the genre.
