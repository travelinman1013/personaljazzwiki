## Biography
Cass Hagan (b. 1904) led a prominent hotel orchestra during the 1920s jazz age, serving as bandleader at upscale venues such as the Park Central Hotel in New York City and the Hotel Manger. Known as a violinist who did not play jazz himself, Hagan was a great admirer of the genre and deliberately assembled his band with skilled jazz musicians to perform hot music alongside dance arrangements. His orchestra gained recognition through recordings on labels like Columbia, including tracks such as 'My Ohio Home' (1928) and 'Golden Gate' (1928), often featuring vocal choruses by Frank Harris (credited as Irving Kaufman).[4][7][2]

Hagan's career flourished in the mid-to-late 1920s, with his Park Central Orchestra active around 1927, as noted in period discographies. The band attracted top talent recommended by figures like Red Nichols, enabling performances that blended jazz improvisation with popular dance styles. Hagan lost the Park Central contract around 1928, after which his activities fade from available records, though his ensemble continued to embody the era's hotel orchestra trend, providing sophisticated entertainment amid the Roaring Twenties.[2][3][6]

Though not a jazz performer himself, Hagan's legacy lies in championing jazz within commercial dance band settings, offering a platform for emerging talents during a pivotal time for the genre's popularization. His orchestra's recordings preserve the lively fox-trot and jazz-infused sound of the period, reflecting the transition from early Dixieland to more polished hot dance music.
