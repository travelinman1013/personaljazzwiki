## Biography
Freddie King (born Freddie Christian on September 3, 1934) was an American blues guitarist and singer whose fiery playing helped bridge Texas country blues, Chicago electric blues, and early blues rock. Born in Gilmer, Texas, he was raised by his mother Ella Mae King and his uncle Leon King, who began teaching him guitar around age six, and he absorbed rural country blues and the jump-blues of artists like Lightnin’ Hopkins and Louis Jordan.[1][4] As a teenager he bought his own guitar with money earned picking cotton and by 1949 relocated with his family to Chicago, where he immersed himself in the city’s club scene, sneaking into venues to sit in with house bands that included Howlin’ Wolf and to listen to Muddy Waters, Jimmy Rogers, Robert Jr. Lockwood, Little Walter, and Eddie Taylor.[1][2] By day he worked in a steel mill and by night he played gigs, forming his own band, the Every Hour Blues Boys, and cutting early sides for labels such as Parrot in the 1950s.[1][2]

King’s recording breakthrough came after he signed with King/Federal Records in 1960, where he worked closely with pianist, arranger, and producer Sonny Thompson.[1] The early 1960s yielded a run of influential singles and albums, including his first LP "Freddy King Sings" (1961) and the instrumental set "Let’s Hide Away and Dance Away with Freddy King," featuring classics like "Hide Away," "San-Ho-Zay," "The Stumble," and "I’m Tore Down"—instrumentals that became standards for generations of blues and rock guitarists.[1][2][3] Nicknamed **“The Texas Cannonball”** for his powerful voice and aggressive stage presence, King developed a distinctive style that fused Texas-open-string phrasing with Chicago pentatonic runs and wide bends, played with a mix of flatpick and fingerpicks for a hard, vocal-like attack.[2][5] From the late 1960s he became a key figure in the rock-oriented blues revival: he signed with Cotillion and later Shelter Records, toured England and major U.S. festivals, headlined the 1969 Texas International Pop Festival, and recorded one of Austin’s first major live albums at the Armadillo World Headquarters, helping make it a premier blues venue.[1]

In the 1970s King’s profile rose further through his close association with British and American rock musicians. Eric Clapton and Jeff Beck recorded his tunes and King toured with Clapton in the mid‑1970s; he later signed to RSO (Robert Stigwood Organisation) and released albums such as "Burglar" (1974), partially produced and recorded with Clapton, and "Larger Than Life" (1975), while touring extensively across the United States, Europe, and Australia.[1][2] Despite mounting health problems exacerbated by a grueling 300‑dates‑a‑year schedule, King continued to perform until his death from complications of bleeding ulcers and pancreatitis in Dallas on December 28–29, 1976, at the age of forty-two.[1][2] Posthumously his reputation only grew: he was inducted into the Blues Foundation’s Blues Hall of Fame in 1982 and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012, was ranked twenty‑fifth on Rolling Stone’s list of the 100 greatest guitarists, and is widely hailed—alongside B.B. King and Albert King—as one of the "Three Kings" of electric blues whose phrasing, tone, and repertoire profoundly shaped players from Eric Clapton, Peter Green, and Mick Taylor to Stevie Ray Vaughan and beyond.[1][2][3][5]

## Fun Facts
- Freddie King is commonly grouped with B.B. King and Albert King as one of the blues’ "Three Kings," even though he was unrelated to either of the other two guitarists.[2]
- He was one of the first prominent blues artists to front a multi‑racial band, reflecting both his broad audience and the crossover appeal of his music in the 1960s and 1970s.[2]
- King’s explosive stage presence and powerful tone earned him the nickname "The Texas Cannonball," a moniker later highlighted in his Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction materials.[2][5]
- The Armadillo World Headquarters in Austin was sometimes called "the House That Freddie King Built" because his early‑1970s live recordings and frequent appearances there were crucial to the venue’s rise as a major blues-rock hub.[1]
