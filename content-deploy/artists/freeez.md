## Biography
Freeez was a British jazz-funk band formed in London, England, around 1980, initiated by John Rocca. The group originally featured Rocca along with musicians such as Andy Stennett on keyboards and Peter Maas on bass guitar, blending jazz, funk, and early electronic elements in their sound. They emerged during the post-disco era, gaining attention for their innovative fusion of live instrumentation and synthesizers.[5][4][6]

Freeez achieved their breakthrough with the 1981 hit single 'Southern Freeez,' which topped the UK Singles Chart and became a landmark in the jazz-funk and rare groove scenes, featuring guest vocalist Ingrid Mansfield. The band released their self-titled debut album in 1981, followed by additional singles and the LP 'Idle Hands' in 1982, incorporating electro influences amid the rising popularity of hip-hop and house music precursors. Their career peaked in the early 1980s before winding down.[5][4][6]

Active primarily from 1981 to 1985, Freeez left a legacy as pioneers of British jazz-funk and electro, with 'Southern Freeez' enduring as a club classic sampled in later tracks and featured in films like 'Beat Street' (1984). The band's music continues to influence rare groove and house DJs, cementing their status in dance music history.[5][7]
