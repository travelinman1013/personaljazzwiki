## Biography
Menahan Street Band is a Brooklyn-based instrumental ensemble renowned for its eclectic blend of retro soul, funk, and afrobeat. Founded in 2007 by guitarist and producer Thomas Brenneck, the band originated in an apartment on Menahan Street in the Bushwick neighborhood, which inspired their name. The group quickly became a cornerstone of the Brooklyn soul revival, drawing together members from other acclaimed acts such as Sharon Jones & The Dap-Kings, The Budos Band, Antibalas, and El Michels Affair.

The band’s signature sound is rooted in vintage soul and funk, but their music also incorporates influences from jazz, afrobeat, and hip-hop, resulting in richly textured, cinematic instrumentals. Their debut album, 'Make the Road by Walking,' released in 2008, became a cult classic and was widely sampled by major hip-hop artists, helping to bridge the gap between classic soul and contemporary music. Menahan Street Band is perhaps best known for their work as the backing band for soul singer Charles Bradley, contributing significantly to his late-career rise and recording several albums with him. After a nearly decade-long hiatus, the band returned in 2021 with 'The Exciting Sounds of Menahan Street Band,' reaffirming their status as leaders in the modern soul movement.

Menahan Street Band's legacy is marked by their role in revitalizing classic soul and funk for a new generation, both through their own recordings and their extensive collaborations and sampling by artists across genres. Their music continues to influence the sound of modern hip-hop and soul, cementing their place as one of the most important instrumental collectives of the 21st century.
