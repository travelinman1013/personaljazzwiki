## Biography
Richard M. Jones, born Richard Marigny Jones on June 13, 1892, in Donaldsonville, Louisiana, was an American jazz pianist, composer, band leader, and record producer who became one of the most influential behind-the-scenes figures in early jazz. Growing up in New Orleans, Jones suffered from a stiff leg and walked with a limp, which led fellow musicians to nickname him "Richard My Knee Jones" as a pun on his middle name. He began his musical career playing alto horn in brass bands as a youth, but the piano became his primary instrument. By 1908, he was performing in Storyville, New Orleans' famous red-light district, and soon began leading his own bands, including The Four Hot Hounds, which featured Sugar Johnny Smith and occasionally King Oliver. He also played in the orchestras of John Robichaux, Armand J. Piron, and Papa Celestin during his New Orleans years.

In 1918, Jones relocated to Chicago, where his career took a pivotal turn from performer to music industry executive. He worked as Chicago manager for publisher and pianist Clarence Williams, establishing the Chicago branch of Williams' publishing company and music store. Beginning in 1923, Jones started his recording career, making records as a piano soloist, accompanist to vocalists, and with his studio bands The Jazz Wizards and The Chicago Cosmopolitans. Throughout the 1920s, he recorded for major labels including Gennett, OKeh, Victor, and Paramount Records. More significantly, Jones served as Chicago supervisor of OKeh Records' "Race" (African-American) Records division for most of the decade, where he produced the legendary Hot Five and Hot Seven recordings led by Louis Armstrong, some of the most important sessions in jazz history. His compositional legacy includes the jazz standard "Trouble in Mind" and "Riverside Blues."

Jones continued his influential work in the music industry through the 1930s and 1940s, holding similar management positions at Decca Records and later Mercury Records. His dual role as both musician and talent scout/producer made him a crucial bridge between New Orleans traditional jazz and the Chicago jazz scene. He remained active in music until his death on December 8, 1945, in Chicago at age 53. While less celebrated as a performer than some of his contemporaries, Jones' contributions as a producer, composer, and industry executive helped shape the development and commercial success of early jazz.
