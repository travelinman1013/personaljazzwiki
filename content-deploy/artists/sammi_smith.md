## Biography
Sammi Smith, born Jewel Fay Smith on August 5, 1943, in Orange, California, emerged as one of the most distinctive voices in country music during the 1970s. Dropping out of school at age eleven, Smith began performing in nightclubs as a pre-teen, honing her craft in the vibrant bar scenes of California and Oklahoma. Her early years were marked by personal challenges and relentless gigging, which shaped her uniquely smoky, emotive vocal style[3][6].

Smith's breakthrough came after signing with Mega Records in 1970, where she was paired with producer Jim Malloy. Her definitive recording of Kris Kristofferson's "Help Me Make It Through the Night" became a massive crossover hit, reaching No. 1 on the country charts and No. 8 on the pop charts, and earning her a Grammy for Best Country Vocal Performance, Female, as well as the Country Music Association's Single of the Year in 1971[1][2][3]. Throughout the 1970s, Smith was a mainstay on the country charts with hits like "Then You Walk In," "Today I Started Loving You Again," and "I've Got to Have You." She was closely associated with both the countrypolitan sound and the Outlaw country movement, relocating to Texas in 1973 and performing alongside figures like Willie Nelson and Waylon Jennings[2][3].

Smith's musical style blended lush, soulful arrangements with a raw, confessional lyricism that set her apart from her contemporaries. Her hushed, intimate vocal delivery and willingness to tackle themes of loneliness and desire influenced a generation of country artists. Later in her career, she developed a deep interest in Native American culture and music, even fronting a band of Native American musicians after moving to Arizona in 1979[3]. Smith's legacy endures, particularly through her iconic interpretation of "Help Me Make It Through the Night," which has been recognized as one of country music's greatest singles.

## Fun Facts
- Smith’s recording of 'Help Me Make It Through the Night' was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame and ranked #1 in the book 'Heartaches By the Number: Country Music’s 500 Greatest Singles.'
- She was one of the few women considered part of the early Outlaw country movement and was dubbed a 'girl hero' by Waylon Jennings.
- After moving to Arizona in 1979, Smith became deeply involved in Native American culture, even fronting a band of all Native American musicians.
- Smith was the mother of singer-songwriter and actor Waylon Payne, named after her friend Waylon Jennings.
