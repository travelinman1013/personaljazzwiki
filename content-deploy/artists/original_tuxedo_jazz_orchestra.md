## Biography
The Original Tuxedo Jazz Orchestra was founded in 1910 by cornetist Oscar 'Papa' Celestin at the Tuxedo Dance Hall in Storyville, New Orleans' renowned red light district. Celestin's innovative leadership transformed the house band into what many acknowledged as New Orleans's best dance band, earning him recognition as a pioneering figure in early jazz history. The band's name variations included the Tuxedo Jazz Band, Tuxedo Jazz Orchestra, and Celestin's Original Tuxedo Orchestra, reflecting its evolution over more than a century of continuous performance.

Under Celestin's direction, the Tuxedo Jazz Orchestra became instrumental in shaping New Orleans jazz during the 1910s and 1920s. The band was among the first jazz ensembles to record in New Orleans and notably pioneered the regular employment of women as pianists, breaking significant barriers in the male-dominated jazz scene. The orchestra built a loyal following that transcended racial and ethnic boundaries through its infectious dance music, which appealed from the bottom of society to the top. In 1911, Celestin also founded the separate Tuxedo Brass Band, which became the busiest and most popular brass band in the city during the 1920s, known for seamlessly blending written arrangements with improvisation—a breakthrough in jazz development.

After declining fortunes during the Depression-era 1930s, the Original Tuxedo Jazz Orchestra experienced a remarkable renaissance during the post-World War II traditional jazz revival. In 1947, Celestin's band returned to the studio with recordings for Deluxe Records, becoming the most popular band in New Orleans by the early 1950s. On May 8, 1953, the Original Tuxedo Jazz Band achieved historic significance by becoming the first New Orleans jazz band to perform at the White House during the annual White House Correspondents' Association banquet, where President Dwight D. Eisenhower personally commended Celestin. The band's legacy continued beyond Celestin's death in 1954, with the ensemble continuing to perform into the 21st century as a living testament to early New Orleans jazz tradition.

## Fun Facts
- In 1923, Louis Armstrong played one of his last New Orleans performances with the Tuxedo Brass Band on the same day he received Joe 'King' Oliver's telegram inviting him to Chicago—making the Tuxedo's members among the first to learn of Armstrong's historic move north.
- The Tuxedo Brass Band achieved a breakthrough in jazz history by being the first ensemble to successfully blend two previously separate traditions: playing from written musical scores and improvisation, fundamentally advancing the development of jazz as an art form.
- An estimated 10,000 people attended Papa Celestin's Canal Street funeral procession on December 15, 1954, with a 4,000-strong second line following 15 black limousines while the Eureka Brass Band and Tuxedo Brass Band members played 'Just a Closer Walk with Thee.'
- Papa Celestin reached the pinnacle of his career in his 1960s, achieving his greatest fame and recognition late in life, particularly after the 1953 White House performance where President Eisenhower praised him as 'a fine gentleman and a credit to your race and our country.'
