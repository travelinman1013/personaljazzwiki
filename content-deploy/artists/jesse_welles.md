## Biography
Jesse Welles, born and raised in Ozark, Arkansas, is a dynamic folk and folk punk singer-songwriter whose music blends raw storytelling with contemporary social commentary. Growing up, his father was a mechanic and his mother a school teacher, and his early exposure to music came from his grandfather, who introduced him to The Beatles' 'White Album' and 'Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band.' At age 12, he bought his first guitar for $56 from Walmart, which became a constant companion as he immersed himself in classic folk and rock, drawing inspiration from Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, Joan Baez, and Woody Guthrie. After studying music theory at John Brown University, Welles began his career by releasing homespun recordings on Bandcamp and SoundCloud, performing in bands such as Dead Indian and Cosmic Americana, and eventually launching his eponymous project Welles in Nashville.

Welles gained wider recognition for his relentless touring, logging 280 shows in a single year and sharing stages with acts like Royal Blood, Highly Suspect, Greta Van Fleet, and Dead Sara. His 2018 album 'Red Trees and White Trashes,' produced by Dave Cobb, showcased a gritty, folk punk-inspired sound. After being dropped by his label during the pandemic and returning to Arkansas, Welles experienced a creative resurgence in 2024 following his father's heart attack. He began posting raw, solo performances in the Ozarks, which went viral and earned him over a million Instagram followers. Since then, he has released multiple full-length albums, including 'Hells Welles,' 'Patchwork,' 'Pilgrim,' 'Devil’s Den,' and 'With the Devil,' cementing his reputation as a modern troubadour in the tradition of Guthrie, Dylan, and Prine, while also addressing urgent contemporary issues in his lyrics.
