## Biography
Tom Hook is a veteran stride pianist, singer, songwriter, and entertainer who began his career in Kansas City, Missouri, performing in local and regional jazz and rock bands, as well as working as a stage performer at Worlds of Fun theme park. He was a founding member of the New Red Onion Jazz Babies, a popular regional traditional jazz band. In 1980, he left Kansas City to start a long association with the Delta Queen Steamboat Company as a lounge entertainer on the Mississippi Queen, later becoming bandleader on the Delta Queen in 1985.[1][2][3][5]

Hook's career expanded in 1986 to Orlando, Florida, where he worked as a staff musician at Walt Disney World, with Bill Allred's Good Time Jazz Band at Rosie O’Grady’s, and fronted his vintage rock band, The Terrier Brothers, at venues like the Orchid Garden and Lil’ Darlin’s Rock and Roll Palace, sharing stages with 1950s and 1960s rock legends. In 1987, he co-founded the Black Dog Jazz Band, leading to performances at major U.S. traditional jazz festivals, tours of Western Europe, and a 1989 tour of Communist China. He balanced theme park roles, such as portraying Sam the Bartender at Disney's Diamond Horseshoe in 1990, with riverboat leadership, including music director at Harrah’s Casino New Orleans in 2001 and Director of Entertainment for Delta Queen Steamboat Co. in 2002. Hook also formed Daymark Productions in 2007 and continues worldwide tours.[1][2][3]

Known for his fluent stride piano style and good-humored performances, Hook has released projects like the dream album *62* on Arbors Records, featuring notable musicians, and stars in his one-man show 'Becoming Jelly Roll' and with his New Orleans All-Stars, fronted by Wendell Brunious, at Preservation Hall, riverboats, and internationally. His musical style blends traditional jazz, stride piano, and vintage rock, with a legacy in entertainment production, voice work for jingles (Kansas City Chiefs, Budweiser, Disney), and period music for video games.[1][2][3][6]
