## Biography
Mary Stallings is a renowned American jazz vocalist born on August 16, 1939, in San Francisco, California. She was the middle child of eleven siblings and began performing professionally at a young age with her mother and sisters in a gospel group. Stallings' early exposure to jazz came from her uncle, saxophonist Orlando Stallings, who encouraged her to develop her unique sound. She was influenced by jazz legends such as Dinah Washington, Billie Holiday, Carmen McRae, and Ella Fitzgerald. By her teens, Stallings was performing in San Francisco nightclubs alongside notable musicians like Ben Webster and Cal Tjader. Her career highlights include a three-year residency with the Count Basie Orchestra from 1969 to 1972 and collaborations with Dizzy Gillespie and Billy Eckstine. Stallings took a hiatus from music to raise her daughter, Adriana Evans, but returned to full-time singing in the early 1980s. Her discography includes notable albums like *Cal Tjader Plays, Mary Stallings Sings* and *Live at the Village Vanguard*. Stallings' style is characterized by her soulful voice, blues-inflected phrasing, and empathic lyric interpretation. Despite her talent, she has often been overlooked for widespread fame, yet continues to inspire new generations of jazz enthusiasts. Her legacy is marked by her enduring passion for jazz and her ability to connect emotionally with her audience through her performances.
