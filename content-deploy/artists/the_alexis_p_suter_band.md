## Biography
The Alexis P Suter Band is a Brooklyn‑born blues and soul‑blues outfit built around powerhouse vocalist and songwriter **Alexis P. Suter** (born February 15, 1963, in Brooklyn, New York, USA). Raised in a deeply musical and religious household, Suter was the youngest child of Carrie Suter, a minister and gospel singer, and Albert Suter, and she began singing in church at the age of four.[1][2] Her early exposure to gospel was broadened by visits to different neighborhood churches and by encounters with touring acts such as the Mills Brothers, whom she first saw live around age nine, experiences that helped shape her commanding vocal presence and spiritual intensity onstage.[1][2] In school she played sousaphone, grounding her in rhythm and ensemble work before she moved toward secular music.[1]

In the early 1990s Suter emerged in New York’s underground club scene, releasing the house single “Slam Me Baby” in 1990 and becoming the first African‑American woman signed to Epic/Sony (Japan), a club‑music phase that later fed into her groove‑oriented blues feel.[1][5] She shifted toward roots and blues after meeting drummer/producer **Ray Grappone** and vocalist/producer **Vicki Bell**, co‑founders of Hipbone Records, which released her blues‑oriented debut album *Shuga Fix* in 2005 and subsequent recordings.[3][6][7] Around this time Levon Helm invited the Alexis P Suter Band to his famed Midnight Ramble sessions in Woodstock; they ultimately opened for Helm more than 100 times, and he produced a CD/DVD for the band, greatly raising their national profile.[1][3] The group went on to release a string of albums, including *Alexis P Suter Band Live at the Midnight Ramble* (2006), *Just Another Fool* (2008), *Two Sides* (2011), *Love the Way You Roll* (2014), and *Just Stay High* (2025), while touring festivals such as Springing the Blues, Briggs Farm Blues Festival, Musikfest, and Blast Furnace Blues.[1][2][8]

Musically, the Alexis P Suter Band is known for a hybrid style that blends **soul blues, gospel, blues rock, and roots Americana**, often compared to giants like Bessie Smith and Big Mama Thornton for its raw power yet distinguished by contemporary songwriting and a band sound honed over decades together.[2][8] Reviewers note Suter’s “genre‑bending” approach, mixing heavy groove, church‑inflected call‑and‑response, and rock dynamics with original material bearing titles like “Love Always Wins” and “Big Girl Panties.”[2] Her long‑running collaboration with an interracial band—frequently described as a Black woman fronting an all‑white ensemble—has challenged expectations in the modern blues scene and underscored themes of community and love that run through her work.[2] Alexis P. Suter has twice been nominated for Blues Music Awards (including the Koko Taylor Award/Soul Blues Female Artist category), has opened for legends such as B.B. King, Buddy Guy, Etta James, and Allen Toussaint, and continues to be recognized as a powerful, spiritually rooted voice carrying gospel, soul, and blues traditions into contemporary contexts.[1][2]

Within the band, the core lineup has evolved but has consistently revolved around Suter’s baritone‑rich lead vocals supported by Ray Grappone on drums, Vicki Bell on backing vocals and co‑writing, and guitar and bass contributors such as Michael Louis, Jimmy Bennett, Peter Bennett, and Tom Terry.[1][2][3][6][7] Their long‑term chemistry—interrupted only by a several‑year hiatus before reuniting—has been described by Suter as a “love language” onstage, where nonverbal cues drive dynamic, improvisatory performances that blur the line between sacred and secular while retaining an unmistakable gospel backbone.[2][3][7] In this way, the Alexis P Suter Band occupies a distinctive place in contemporary blues and soul blues, bridging church and club, tradition and innovation, in a body of work that spans more than a quarter century.[1][2][7]

## Fun Facts
- Before focusing on blues and soul blues, Alexis P. Suter released the 1990 house single “Slam Me Baby” and became the first African‑American woman signed to Epic/Sony (Japan), making her initially known in the underground garage/club scene rather than the blues world.[1][5]
- Suter and her band opened for Levon Helm more than 100 times at his Midnight Ramble in Woodstock and at major venues like the Beacon and the Paramount; Helm became so close to the family that he would call Suter’s mother just to check on her.[1][3]
- B.B. King was impressed enough with Suter’s live performances that he invited her band to open for him and reportedly said, “It’s a rare thing to share the stage with great talent like that young lady,” highlighting the respect she garnered from blues royalty.[1]
- Alexis P. Suter grew up in a strict Pentecostal household and later rode with motorcycle clubs as a young adult, even serving as a sergeant‑at‑arms, a contrast she has described as part of the “wild ride” of her life before fully committing to her music career.[2]
