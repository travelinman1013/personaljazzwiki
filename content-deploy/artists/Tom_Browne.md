## Biography
Tom Browne, born October 30, 1954, in Queens, New York, is a celebrated jazz trumpeter known for his dynamic fusion of jazz, funk, R&B, and post-disco. Browne began his musical journey at age 11 with the piano before gravitating toward the trumpet, receiving classical training and attending the prestigious High School of Music and Art in New York. He furthered his studies at the Manhattan School of Music and Kingsborough College, where he earned a degree in physics while immersing himself in the vibrant New York jazz scene.

Browne's early professional career was shaped by mentorship from jazz luminaries such as Jimmy Nottingham, Richard Williams, Woody Shaw, and Freddie Hubbard. He gained recognition as a sideman with Weldon Irvine and Sonny Fortune, and his warm trumpet sound was highlighted in Downbeat Magazine's review of Fortune's 1976 album 'Infinity Is.' In 1978, Browne led a jazz quintet at the Breezin' Lounge, which led to a recording contract with GRP Records. His debut album 'Browne Sugar' (1979) and subsequent releases 'Love Approach' (1980) and 'Magic' (1981) produced major hits like 'Funkin' for Jamaica (N.Y.),' 'Thighs High,' and 'Secret Fantasy,' cementing his place in jazz-funk history.

Throughout his career, Browne has collaborated with a range of artists and continued to evolve musically, recording straight-ahead jazz and funk projects with icons such as Ron Carter, Idris Muhammad, and Billy Childs. Despite a period spent as a commercial airline pilot, Browne returned to recording and touring, maintaining a legacy as a versatile and influential figure in jazz and funk.
