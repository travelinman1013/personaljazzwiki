## Biography
Rhyze was an American R&B and funk band that emerged from New York City in the late 1970s, evolving from an earlier group called Soul Unlimited and later The Nu-Sound Express, LTD. The members met while still in college and became associated with producer and songwriter Paul Kyser, who played a pivotal role in shaping their sound and career. Under Kyser's guidance, they transitioned from local performances in the New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania area to recording and releasing music as Rhyze.

The band is best known for their 1980 hit "Just How Sweet Is Your Love," which achieved success on both the Billboard Hot Dance/Disco and Black Singles charts. Their energetic blend of funk, R&B, soul, and disco was showcased on two albums: 'Just How Sweet Is Your Love' (1980) and 'Rhyze To The Top' (1981). Rhyze's music was characterized by tight horn arrangements, soulful vocals, and danceable grooves, drawing comparisons to contemporaries in the funk and disco scenes. Their work earned them a Grammy nomination for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals in 1981, as well as a nomination for Best New Artist the same year.

Despite their brief period of mainstream activity, Rhyze left a lasting impression on the late disco and early 80s funk landscape. After disbanding around 1981, the group saw a resurgence of interest in their music among soul and funk enthusiasts, particularly in the UK. In 2011, they released a devotional album, 'God Is On Call,' demonstrating their continued creative spirit decades after their initial success.
