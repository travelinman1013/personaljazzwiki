## Biography
Whiskey Shivers is an American bluegrass band formed in Austin, Texas, known for their high-energy performances and their genre-blending sound often described as 'trashgrass'—a fusion of bluegrass, punk, and Americana. The group’s members hail from various small towns across the United States, coming together in Austin after bassist Andrew VanVoorhees responded to a Craigslist ad posted by Bobby Fitzgerald, the band’s charismatic frontman and fiddle player. The full lineup solidified with Fitzgerald (vocals, fiddle) from Dundee, NY, VanVoorhees (bass, vocals) from Prineville, OR, Jeff 'Horti' Hortillosa (vocals, guitar) from Middlesboro, KY, James Bookert (banjo) from Georgetown, TX, and Joe Deuce (washboards) from Meridian, MS.[1][2][6]

Whiskey Shivers quickly gained a reputation for their raucous, joyful live shows, often breaking down the barrier between band and audience with a communal, participatory spirit. Their music is rooted in traditional bluegrass themes—work, pain, sin, regret, and death—but delivered with a frenetic, punk-infused energy and a darkly comedic twist. Their discography includes self-produced albums like 'Batholith' and 'Rampa Head,' with their 2014 self-titled album produced by Robert Ellis marking a breakthrough into a wider market. Their fifth album, 'Some Part of Something,' is widely regarded as their strongest, featuring inventive covers and showcasing their evolution as songwriters.[1][2]

The band’s legacy is defined by their willingness to subvert bluegrass conventions, infusing the genre with a raw, playful edge that appeals to both traditionalists and newcomers. Their viral horror-themed music video, appearances on shows like 'The Daily Show' and 'Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations,' and a cameo in 'Pitch Perfect 3' have cemented their status as innovators within Americana music. Whiskey Shivers' philosophy is centered on embracing life’s struggles with humor and honesty, making their performances both cathartic and unforgettable.[1][2][3]
