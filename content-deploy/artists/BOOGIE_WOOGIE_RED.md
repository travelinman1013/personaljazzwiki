## Biography
Boogie Woogie Red, born Vernon Harrison in Rayville, Louisiana in 1926, moved with his family to Detroit as a young child and quickly became immersed in the city’s vibrant blues scene[2][3][6]. Growing up in Detroit’s Black Bottom neighborhood, he was exposed to the soulful sounds of local musicians, especially the influential blues pianist Big Maceo Merriweather, whose performances inspired Red to teach himself piano[1][2][3]. His father, a part-time vaudeville comedian, also instilled in him a love for stagecraft and storytelling, which later became a hallmark of his live performances[1][3].

By his late teens, Red was already active in the blues circuit, jamming with notable artists like Lonnie Johnson, Tampa Red, and Memphis Slim in Chicago before returning to Detroit in 1946[2]. There, he became a fixture in the local scene, spending fourteen years as the pianist for John Lee Hooker and running his own after-hours club, a real 'blind pig,' where legends like Elmore James and Sonny Boy Williamson would drop by to play[1][2][4]. Red was known for blending blues with jazz, swing, and boogie-woogie, and for his comedic stage persona, which included impressions and witty storytelling[1][3][4].

After stepping back from performing in the early 1960s due to the decline of blues gigs in Detroit and health issues, Red made a remarkable comeback in the 1970s, performing at the Blind Pig Café in Ann Arbor and touring Europe to enthusiastic audiences[1][2][3][4]. His 1974 album 'Live at the Blind Pig' was the inaugural release for Blind Pig Records and captured his unique blend of musicianship and showmanship[4]. Red’s legacy endures as a vital link in Detroit’s blues tradition, celebrated for his authentic style and ability to bridge the worlds of music and comedy.
