## Biography
Joel Ross is a Chicago-born, Brooklyn-based vibraphonist and composer who has rapidly emerged as one of the most influential voices in modern jazz. Raised in a musical household on Chicago’s South Side, Ross and his twin brother began playing drums at age three, later joining their church band and participating in school ensembles. Ross was assigned the xylophone, which set him on the path to mastering mallet percussion instruments, eventually gravitating toward the vibraphone. His formative years were shaped by the vibrant traditions of Black music in Chicago, including church and improvised music scenes, before he moved to New York to further his studies.

Ross attended the University of the Pacific, where he joined the Brubeck Institute Jazz Quintet under the mentorship of Stefon Harris, who revolutionized his technique and approach to harmony. He later completed a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Jazz Studies at The New School in Manhattan. Ross quickly gained recognition for his intricate compositions and improvisational prowess, releasing acclaimed albums on Blue Note Records such as 'KingMaker' (2019), 'Who Are You?' (2020), and 'The Parable of the Poet' (2022). He has performed at major venues and festivals worldwide and collaborated with leading contemporary jazz artists, including Makaya McCraven, Walter Smith III, and Marquis Hill.

Ross’s musical style is marked by a thoughtful blend of jazz, blues, and soul, characterized by lyrical intuition and collective spontaneity. His work as a bandleader, especially with his ensemble Good Vibes, reflects his commitment to authentic discourse and creative response. Ross’s legacy is already taking shape as he continues to push the boundaries of modern jazz, inspiring a new generation of musicians with his innovative artistry.
