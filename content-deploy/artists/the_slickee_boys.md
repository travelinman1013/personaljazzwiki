## Biography
The Slickee Boys were a Washington, D.C.-area band founded in 1976 by guitarists Kim Kane and Marshall Keith, with Martha Hull as the original lead vocalist[2][3]. The group quickly became local favorites, known for their energetic live shows and a genre-blending sound that mixed psychedelic and garage rock, new wave, rockabilly, exotica, and punk—a style they dubbed 'slickee-delic'[1]. After a period of rotating members, the band’s defining lineup solidified in 1979 with Mark Noone on vocals, Emory Alexa (later John Chumbris) on bass, and Dan Palenski on drums, alongside the founding guitarists[1][2]. Their creative peak produced a trio of singles from 1979–1981 and the 1983 album *Cybernetic Dreams of Pi*[1]. The Slickee Boys were stalwarts of the D.C. punk scene, mentoring many in the early hardcore wave and holding the record for most performances at the iconic 9:30 Club with 81 shows[1]. They released several albums, including *Uh Oh...No Breaks!* (1985) and *Fashionably Late* (1988), before disbanding in 1991, though they continued to reunite annually for holiday shows in the D.C. and Baltimore area for years afterward[2]. Their legacy endures as pioneers who helped shape the region’s vibrant underground music culture.

- The Slickee Boys hold the record for the most performances at D.C.’s 9:30 Club, with 81 shows[1].
