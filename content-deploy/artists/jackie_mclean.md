## Biography
Jackie McLean, born John Lenwood McLean, Jr. on May 17, 1932, in Harlem, New York, was a pioneering jazz alto saxophonist recognized for his powerful, emotionally charged sound and his role in the evolution of hard bop, bebop, and later free jazz. Growing up in the vibrant Sugar Hill section of Harlem, McLean was surrounded by music—his father played guitar for Tiny Bradshaw, and his godfather Norman Cobbs introduced him to gospel and the Apollo Theater. Early exposure to jazz legends like Thelonious Monk and Sonny Rollins shaped his musical ambitions, and after acquiring his first alto saxophone at fifteen, McLean began to study and imitate the styles of Ben Webster and Lester Young before discovering his lifelong idol, Charlie Parker, who encouraged him to develop his own voice.[1][3][4]

McLean's career took off in the early 1950s, performing and recording with Miles Davis (notably on the album 'Dig'), Charles Mingus, Gene Ammons, and as a member of Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers. His playing was marked by a distinctive, hard-blowing sound and a willingness to push the boundaries of jazz improvisation. Despite struggles with heroin addiction and legal troubles, McLean persevered, eventually shifting his focus to education and advocacy. In 1968, he joined the University of Hartford's Hartt School of Music, where he founded the jazz studies program and later the Artists Collective, Inc., fostering a new generation of jazz musicians and promoting African American cultural appreciation. McLean remained active as a performer and educator until his death in Hartford, Connecticut, on March 31, 2006, leaving a lasting legacy as both a jazz innovator and a mentor.[1][2][3][5]

## Fun Facts

- He was punched by Charles Mingus during a heated argument, leading to a dramatic confrontation that McLean later recounted as a near-life-changing moment.[4]
- McLean's shrill, hard-blowing sound was initially controversial but became a hallmark of his style and influenced the direction of modern jazz.[1]
- He helped found the Artists Collective, Inc. in Hartford, Connecticut, which became a major center for African American arts and jazz education.[5]
