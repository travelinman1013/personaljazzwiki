## Biography
The Upperclassmen is a musical group associated with the go-go genre, a distinctive style of funk music rooted in Washington, D.C. Go-go is characterized by its syncopated rhythms, heavy use of percussion, and interactive live performances, often featuring call-and-response with the audience. While The Upperclassmen's specific origins and early history are not widely documented in major music databases or go-go histories, their inclusion in go-go genre listings suggests a connection to the vibrant D.C. music scene that has produced influential acts since the 1970s.

Go-go music itself was pioneered by artists like Chuck Brown and the Soul Searchers, with later contributions from bands such as Experience Unlimited (E.U.), Trouble Funk, and Rare Essence. The Upperclassmen likely drew inspiration from these foundational acts, adopting the genre’s signature blend of funk, soul, and Afro-Latin rhythms. Their musical style would be expected to emphasize live instrumentation, extended grooves, and a strong sense of community engagement, hallmarks of the go-go tradition.

Despite their low mainstream profile and limited available information, The Upperclassmen’s presence in go-go genre listings points to their participation in a uniquely regional musical legacy that continues to influence new generations of musicians in Washington, D.C. and beyond.
