## Biography
Ervin "Vin" Bruce (April 25, 1932 – June 8, 2018) was a pioneering Cajun singer and guitarist born in Cut Off, Louisiana. Raised in a musical family—his father, Levy Bruce, was a local fiddle player—Vin began playing guitar at age 10 and quickly developed a passion for Cajun music. By his teens, he was performing with local groups like the Southern Serenaders and the Hillbilly Swing Kings, and his smooth, gentle baritone voice soon attracted attention.

Bruce's career took off in 1951 when, at just 18, he signed with Columbia Records, making him the first Cajun artist on a major label since the 1930s. He recorded enduring Cajun classics such as "Dans La Louisiane," "Fille de la Ville," and "Clair de la Lune" with Nashville legends like Chet Atkins, Grady Martin, and Owen Bradley. Bruce was also among the first Cajun musicians to perform on the stages of the Grand Ole Opry and Louisiana Hayride, helping to bring Cajun music to a national audience. Despite a downturn in the mid-1950s due to the rise of rock and roll, Bruce continued to record and perform, notably signing with Swallow Records in 1961 and releasing the hit single "Jole Blon."

Known as "the King of Cajun Singers," Vin Bruce's legacy is cemented by his induction into several halls of fame, including the Nashville Music Hall of Fame and the Cajun Music Hall of Fame. He remained active throughout his life, performing internationally and fostering the growth of Cajun music. Bruce's influence extended beyond his recordings, as he inspired generations of Cajun musicians and was celebrated as a cultural ambassador for Louisiana.
