## Biography
Arlo Davy Guthrie, born July 10, 1947, in Brooklyn, New York, is an American folk singer-songwriter renowned for his protest songs, storytelling, and social commentary. The son of legendary folk musician Woody Guthrie and dancer Marjorie Mazia Guthrie, Arlo grew up immersed in a vibrant artistic community, surrounded by influential figures such as Pete Seeger and members of The Weavers. He began performing publicly at age 13, quickly establishing himself within the burgeoning 1960s folk scene.

Guthrie's breakthrough came in 1967 with the release of 'Alice's Restaurant Massacree,' an 18-minute satirical talking blues that became an anthem for the anti-Vietnam War movement. The song's popularity led to a film adaptation in which Arlo starred, further cementing his place in American counterculture. Over the decades, Guthrie's career has spanned songwriting, recording, and extensive touring, with notable works including his hit cover of 'City of New Orleans' and the album 'Hobo's Lullaby.' His music blends traditional folk with humor and narrative, and he is recognized for both his activism and his role in preserving and evolving the folk tradition.

Beyond his own recordings, Guthrie has been a key figure in folk music's intergenerational transmission, collaborating with icons like Pete Seeger and nurturing the careers of his own children. He founded Rising Son Records, one of the earliest independent labels, and established The Guthrie Center in Massachusetts, furthering his legacy as a community builder and cultural bridge.
