## Biography
Wooding's Grand Central Red Caps was a jazz and ragtime band led by Russell Wooding, active in the early 1930s, primarily based in New York City. The group is documented performing and recording in NYC, with a notable session on May 13, 1931, featuring Russell Wooding as director, unknown trumpet players, and probably Bennie Morton on trombone, alongside other unknown reed and rhythm section musicians.[1][3] Their style aligned with the ragtime and jazz dance band genre popular at the time, as indicated by Spotify classification and recordings like 'That's My Desire' with vocalist Dick Robertson.[3][5]

The band's career centered around live performances and recordings during the height of the swing and jazz era transition. They recorded for Victor in 1931, capturing tracks such as 'That's My Desire,' which later influenced covers by other artists.[3][9] Russell Wooding, the band's leader, directed this ensemble in a period when similar groups toured and performed in major cities like New York and Chicago, though specific residencies for the Red Caps are not detailed beyond the 1931 NYC activity.[1][5] Their output reflects the energetic, vocal-led jazz style of Harlem and urban scenes.

Little is known of the band's long-term legacy, with popularity near zero on modern platforms like Spotify, suggesting they were a short-lived or regionally focused group. Recordings preserve their contributions to early jazz discography, occasionally resurfacing in historical compilations and YouTube uploads.[5][7]
