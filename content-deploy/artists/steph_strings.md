## Biography
Steph Strings is an Australian guitarist, singer‑songwriter and storyteller based between San Remo and Melbourne, Victoria, known for her percussive, fingerstyle‑driven indie‑folk sound.[2][5][6] Growing up in Melbourne surrounded by family, sport and music, she was introduced early to artists like Elvis Presley through car rides with her father and was inspired by watching her cousins jam together.[3][4] As a teenager she attended her first major concert by Ed Sheeran at 14, and she credits the encouragement and informal lessons from her dad and cousins with helping her discover the joy of jamming and exploring different sounds.[3] By her late teens she had become a multi‑instrumentalist, spending significant time busking at Camberwell Market and playing small gigs around Melbourne’s inner‑north, especially in Fitzroy.[3][4]

Strings began her professional career around 2016 and released her debut EP *Allegoric Oceans* in 2017–2018, a six‑track, 22‑minute collection that introduced her blend of fingerstyle guitar and indie‑rock elements.[1][3] She continued to hone her craft as a solo performer, building a following through street performances, intimate venues, and her YouTube channel, which has attracted millions of views.[1][3] Her breakout came with the 2022 single “Dusty Road,” originally written as a poem and first performed live at the Evelyn Hotel in Fitzroy; despite her initial fear of singing in public, the song went on to become her most‑streamed track on Spotify, passing a million streams and establishing her as a rising artist in Australian roots and folk music.[1][4] Alongside “Dusty Road,” songs like “Lion,” “Please Come Home,” and “San Remo” have further showcased her narrative songwriting and dynamic acoustic technique.[1][5]

Musically, Strings draws heavily on the percussive, open‑tuned fingerstyle tradition, weaving **Celtic, blues and coastal indie‑rock** colours into largely acoustic arrangements that emphasize rhythm and melody over dense production.[2][5][6] She cites John Butler Trio, Tash Sultana, Kim Churchill and Ziggy Alberts as key influences, and her performances often feature instrumental passages where the guitar effectively “sings” in place of vocals—a legacy of years when she focused on guitar because she was reluctant to sing.[2][3][4] Building on her early EP, she announced a follow‑up EP, *Wildfire*, and has expanded from local stages to festival line‑ups such as Ocean Sounds Festival and Winter Wine Festival, as well as international appearances including Les Escales Festival in France.[5] Having supported acts like The Pierce Brothers, Kim Churchill and Ash Grunwald, she is increasingly recognized as part of a new wave of Australian acoustic storytellers blending roots, folk and indie sounds.[5][6]

## Fun Facts
- Before she was willing to sing in public, she developed her intricate fingerstyle technique by effectively letting her guitar “sing” the vocal melodies so audiences could sing along while she stayed silent.[4]
- Her song “Dusty Road,” which became her most‑streamed track on Spotify, started out as a poem with a whistled chorus before she adapted it into a sung piece for her first full show at the Evelyn Hotel in Fitzroy.[1][4]
- She has roots in busking at Melbourne’s Camberwell Market, where she regularly performed as a teenager and early‑career musician before moving onto ticketed gigs and festivals.[3][4]
- Her track “San Remo” was written with the hope that it would one day feature in a San Remo pasta commercial or a Phillip Island tourism campaign; it ultimately became the feature song in a Phillip Island marketing campaign, fulfilling that early ambition.[5]
