## Biography
Fred Wesley is a legendary trombonist and bandleader born in Columbus, Georgia, and raised in Mobile, Alabama, who emerged as one of the primary architects of funk music.[1][2] He began his professional career as a teenage trombonist with Ike and Tina Turner before joining James Brown's organization, where he served as music director, arranger, trombonist, and primary composer from 1968 to 1975.[1][2] During this pivotal period, Wesley played an instrumental role in helping James Brown's band shift its sound from soul to funk, a transformation that would become dominant in R&B music and establish the foundational language of the genre.[1][2] His surgically precise solos and orchestration of sinuous grooves earned him the distinction of being called "the world's most famous sideman."[1][2]

In 1976, Wesley and fellow horn player Maceo Parker departed from James Brown's organization to join George Clinton and the Parliament-Funkadelic collective, where they collaborated on influential albums that pushed funk to new creative heights.[1][2] Wesley's work during the P-Funk era demonstrated his versatility and continued innovation within the genre. Beyond his work with these major acts, Wesley established himself as a highly sought-after arranger and collaborator, working with an extensive roster of artists including Ray Charles, Curtis Mayfield, Van Morrison, the Count Basie Orchestra, and numerous others.[1][2][4]

In 1996, Wesley formed his own band, initially called The Fred Wesley Group, which evolved into Fred Wesley and the New JBs.[3] For more than 30 years, this ensemble has served as the primary keeper of roots funk music, maintaining the standards Wesley helped establish while performing seminal hits like "Pass the Peas" and "Big Payback" alongside original jazz, funk, and blues compositions.[1][5][6] Wesley is also a published author, having written the acclaimed memoir "Hit Me, Fred: Recollections of a Sideman" (Duke University Press, 2002), and continues to share his musical knowledge through master classes and educational settings worldwide.[4][5] As one of music's most-sampled musicians, his influence extends to contemporary artists including Janet Jackson and Nas.[4]
