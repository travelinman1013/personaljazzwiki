## Biography
Clarence Johnson III is a celebrated saxophonist, composer, and educator from New Orleans, Louisiana, known for his commanding and expressive saxophone sound. Raised in the vibrant musical culture of New Orleans, Johnson demonstrated prodigious talent early on, serving as a drum major and standout saxophonist during his high school years at Brother Martin in the early 1990s. He went on to earn a Bachelor of Music in Jazz Studies from Loyola University New Orleans and a Master of Music from the University of New Orleans, laying a strong academic foundation for his career.

Throughout his professional journey, Johnson has become a fixture in both the local and international jazz scenes. His style blends straight-ahead jazz with elements of jazz fusion, contemporary instrumental music, and rhythm and blues, drawing comparisons to the likes of Stanley Clarke, George Duke, the Brecker Brothers, and the Yellowjackets. Johnson has released several recordings as a leader, including the acclaimed "Watch Him Work," and has performed at major festivals such as the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival and the inaugural Yerevan International Jazz Festival in Armenia. His bands have been described as exhibiting "Coltranesque Impressionism" and "Sun Ra Futurism," reflecting his innovative approach to jazz.

In addition to his solo work, Johnson is a sought-after collaborator, having recorded and performed with a diverse array of artists including Tori Amos, Bruce Hornsby, Davell Crawford, Dr. John, members of the Neville Brothers, Allen Toussaint, and Wynton Marsalis. He has also contributed to film and television, appearing in the award-winning movie "Ray" and various commercials. As an educator, Johnson has taught at Loyola University, Delgado Community College, Morehouse College, and Spelman College, and has served as a clinician for the National Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences’ “Grammy in the Schools.” His contributions to music and culture have been recognized with multiple awards, including Offbeat Magazine’s “Best Saxophonist” and a Lifetime Achievement Cultural Ambassador Heartbeat Award.
