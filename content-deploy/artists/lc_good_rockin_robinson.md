## Biography
L.C. "Good Rockin'" Robinson, born Louis Charles Robinson on May 13, 1914 (some sources cite May 15, 1915) in Brenham, Texas, was a pioneering American blues singer, guitarist, and fiddle player. He began playing guitar at the age of nine and was reputedly taught the bottleneck slide style by the legendary Blind Willie Johnson. Robinson's early exposure to both gospel and blues traditions in Texas deeply influenced his musical approach, blending soulful vocals with innovative guitar and fiddle techniques.

After moving to the San Francisco Bay Area, Robinson became a central figure in the West Coast blues scene, renowned for his mastery of the lap steel guitar—a rarity in blues at the time. His energetic performances and technical prowess earned him the nickname "Good Rockin'." In the late 1960s, he gained wider recognition through recordings such as "Oakland Blues" and his own album "Mojo in My Hand." Robinson's style combined classic blues, boogie-woogie, and gospel influences, leaving a lasting impact on the Bay Area blues community and beyond.

Though he never achieved major commercial fame, Robinson's legacy endures through his recordings and the musicians he inspired. His innovative use of the lap steel guitar and expressive bottleneck slide work helped shape the sound of modern blues, particularly on the West Coast. He passed away on September 26, 1976, but remains celebrated as a masterful performer and a key link between Texas and California blues traditions.
