## Biography
Phantogram is an American electronic rock duo formed in 2007 in Greenwich, New York, by lifelong friends Sarah Barthel and Josh Carter. The two met in preschool and reconnected after Barthel left her visual arts studies and Carter returned from playing in his brother's experimental band. Initially performing under the name Charlie Everywhere, they changed their name to Phantogram in 2009, inspired by an optical illusion that reflects their ability to create a sound much larger than their two-person lineup.

Phantogram's debut album, 'Eyelid Movies,' was released in 2009 in Europe and 2010 in the United States, earning critical acclaim for its blend of electronic, indie, and psych-pop elements. Their music is characterized by 'street beat, psych pop'—a fusion of swirling guitars, spacey keyboards, hip-hop-inspired rhythms, and ethereal vocals. Over the years, the duo has released several albums and EPs, including 'Voices' (2014) and 'Ceremony' (2020), and has collaborated with artists such as Big Boi and The Flaming Lips. Their tracks have been featured in various media, including TV shows, advertisements, and video games, cementing their reputation as innovators in the indie electronic scene.

Phantogram's legacy lies in their ability to merge diverse influences—ranging from hip-hop to dream pop—into a distinctive, genre-blurring sound. Their DIY roots in upstate New York's arts community and their commitment to self-producing much of their work have made them a standout act, inspiring a new generation of indie and electronic musicians.
