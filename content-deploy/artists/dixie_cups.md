## Biography
The Dixie Cups are an American pop music girl group established in the 1960s, originally from New Orleans, Louisiana. The trio consisted of sisters Barbara Ann Hawkins and Rosa Lee Hawkins, along with their cousin Joan Marie Johnson. They began singing together in grade school and initially performed locally as The Meltones before being discovered at a talent show by singer/producer Joe Jones. Jones introduced them to legendary producers Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, who signed them to Red Bird Records and renamed them The Dixie Cups. Their debut single, "Chapel of Love," became a massive hit in 1964, reaching number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and selling over a million copies. The group is known for their catchy harmonies and contributions to the doo-wop and pop genres, with other notable hits including "People Say" and "Iko Iko." After a brief hiatus and lineup changes, The Dixie Cups continued to tour and perform, earning recognition from the Rhythm & Blues Foundation and the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame. Their legacy endures as pioneers of the girl group sound and as influential figures in American pop music history[2][3][4].
