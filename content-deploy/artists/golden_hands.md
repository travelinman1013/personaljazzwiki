## Biography
Golden Hands is a **Moroccan rock and funk band** formed in 1969 in Casablanca by two brothers and a friend, emerging during a fertile period for North African psychedelic and groove‑based music.[5][6][8] The group developed a distinctive sound that fused Western rock, soul, and funk with Moroccan melodic and rhythmic sensibilities, sometimes described as “rock and funk topped with a Moroccan sauce.”[5][6] In the early years they built a local following in Morocco’s club and live circuit, reflecting the global spread of rock culture into North Africa at the end of the 1960s.

During the 1970s Golden Hands began to gain **cult status**, both at home and later among international collectors, thanks to extended, guitar‑driven tracks and tightly arranged rhythm sections that sat comfortably alongside contemporary American and European hard rock and funk, yet retained a regional character.[5][6][8] Songs like “Take Me Back,” “She’s Like The Time,” and “My Story With Mrs. Life” showcase long-form rock structures, gritty vocals, and Hammond‑style textures familiar from 1970s AM and FM rock, while pieces such as “Al Harka” weave in modal, Middle Eastern‑tinged motifs.[5][8] After experiencing success in Morocco, the band brought this repertoire to European stages, adding to their underground reputation among crate‑diggers and psych‑rock enthusiasts.[5][6]

Though Golden Hands did not achieve mainstream international fame during their original run, later reissues and archival releases have solidified their **legacy as a cult Moroccan rock band** whose recordings document a vibrant, hybrid music scene that bridged Maghrebi traditions and global rock trends.[5][6][8] Contemporary labels and writers now highlight Golden Hands as part of a broader rediscovery of 1970s North African rock and funk, positioning the band as an important reference point for listeners and musicians interested in cross‑cultural psychedelic and groove‑oriented music.[2][5][6][8]
