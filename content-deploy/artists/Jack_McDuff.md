## Biography
Jack McDuff, born Eugene McDuffy on September 17, 1926, in Champaign, Illinois, was a pivotal figure in the evolution of jazz organ. Initially a self-taught bassist, McDuff began his professional career performing with artists such as Joe Farrell and Denny Zeitlin before shifting his focus to the piano and, ultimately, the Hammond B-3 organ in the late 1950s. His move to the organ was encouraged by saxophonist Willis Jackson, with whom McDuff played bass before joining Jackson’s band as an organist. This transition marked the start of a prolific career that would see McDuff become a leading force in the hard bop and soul jazz movements of the 1960s.[1][2][3]

McDuff quickly established himself as a bandleader, forming influential organ trios and quartets that featured future jazz stars, most notably giving guitarist George Benson his first major break. His recordings for Prestige Records, including 'Brother Jack' (1960), 'The Honeydripper' (1961), and 'Screamin’' (1962), are considered classics of the genre. McDuff’s style was characterized by deep grooves, bluesy phrasing, and a mastery of the Hammond B-3 that helped define the sound of jazz funk and soul jazz. Throughout the 1970s and beyond, he continued to record and perform, adapting to changing musical landscapes while mentoring younger musicians and collaborating with a wide range of artists.[1][3][5]

Jack McDuff’s legacy lies in his role as both a trailblazer and a mentor. He was instrumental in popularizing the organ within jazz, influencing generations of musicians with his energetic performances and innovative approach. His work not only shaped the sound of jazz organ but also bridged the gap between jazz, blues, and funk, leaving an indelible mark on American music. McDuff passed away on January 23, 2001, but his recordings and the musicians he inspired continue to keep his spirit alive.[1][2]
