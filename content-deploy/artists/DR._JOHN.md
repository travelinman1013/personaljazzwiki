## Biography
Malcolm John Rebennack Jr., known professionally as Dr. John, was born on November 20, 1941, in New Orleans, Louisiana. Raised in a city renowned for its vibrant musical traditions, he was immersed in rhythm and blues from an early age through his father's record and musical equipment shop. He began playing guitar at age seven, receiving lessons from local R&B legends Walter 'Papoose' Nelson and Roy Montrell, both of whom played with Fats Domino. By his teens, Dr. John was performing in clubs and working as a session musician at the famed J&M Studio, collaborating with artists like Professor Longhair and Joe Tex. 

Dr. John's early career was shaped by the rich musical melting pot of New Orleans, blending blues, jazz, R&B, soul, and funk. After a gunshot injury to his hand in 1960, he shifted his focus from guitar to piano, developing a distinctive style heavily influenced by Professor Longhair. In the late 1960s, he adopted the Dr. John persona, inspired by New Orleans voodoo traditions, and released his breakthrough album 'Gris-Gris' in 1968. His theatrical stage presence, often featuring elaborate costumes and mystical themes, became a hallmark of his performances. He achieved mainstream success in the 1970s with the hit single 'Right Place, Wrong Time' and continued to record prolifically, earning six Grammy Awards and induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

Throughout his five-decade career, Dr. John became a cultural ambassador for New Orleans music, collaborating with a wide array of artists and influencing generations of musicians. His legacy endures through his extensive discography, his role in popularizing New Orleans musical traditions, and his impact on genres ranging from funk to rock and roll.
