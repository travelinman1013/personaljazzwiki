## Biography
Tex Owens, born Doie Hensley Owens on June 15, 1892, in Killeen, Texas, was the eldest of thirteen children in a sharecropping family. Growing up in Texas and Oklahoma, he spent his youth working on ranches and in oil fields, which deeply influenced his later musical themes. Owens began his musical journey as a self-taught guitarist and singer, performing at traveling tent shows and later on radio, where his tall stature and authentic cowboy persona made him a natural entertainer.

In 1931, encouraged by friends, Owens transitioned to radio, co-hosting the popular 'Brush Creek Follies' on KMBC in Kansas City with his group, the Original Texas Rangers, and his daughters. He signed with Decca Records in 1934 and wrote his most enduring song, 'Cattle Call,' in 1935—a tune that would later become a major hit for Eddy Arnold. While Owens' own recordings were modestly received, his influence was felt through his radio performances, songwriting, and his leadership of groups like the Texas Rangers and the Prairie Pioneers. He continued to perform on radio and in live appearances, and even worked in film until a serious injury in 1950 curtailed his career. Owens died in Baden, Texas, in 1962, and was posthumously inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1971, cementing his legacy as a foundational figure in early country and western music.
