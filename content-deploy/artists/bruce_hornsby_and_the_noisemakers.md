## Biography
Bruce Hornsby, born in Williamsburg, Virginia, showed an early interest in music, singing 'Hound Dog' at age 3 or 4 with reel-to-reel tapes capturing his performances in a musical household. Influenced by folk acts like Peter, Paul and Mary, then the Beatles, Stones, Elton John, and Leon Russell, he began playing piano by ear, emulating piano-oriented records. He studied at the University of Miami and briefly at Berklee College of Music, where he immersed himself in jazz, becoming a bebopper while also drawing from Dr. John, Professor Longhair, Steely Dan, and Michael McDonald's white R&B style.[1][2][3][4]

After graduating in 1977, Hornsby returned to Virginia, formed a band, and began songwriting, heavily influenced by Steely Dan, Pat Metheny, and McDonald, who discovered him. His breakthrough came with the 1986 album *The Way It Is*, featuring the hit title track blending pop, jazz, bluegrass, and '60s soul, earning Grammys and platinum sales. He formed Bruce Hornsby & The Noisemakers for live performances and further exploration, maintaining a 'Virginia sound' mixing Bill Evans piano voicings, Leon Russell grooves, hymns, and traditional music.[2][4][6]

Hornsby's legacy spans diverse collaborations with Grateful Dead, Bob Dylan, Branford Marsalis, Ricky Skaggs, Bonnie Raitt, Béla Fleck, Pat Metheny, Willie Nelson, and others, alongside solo albums like *Camp Meeting* showcasing jazz prowess. A two-time Grammy winner, he continues adventurous work drawing from American traditions including pop, R&B, folk, jazz, bluegrass, gospel, and classical elements.[4][5][6]
