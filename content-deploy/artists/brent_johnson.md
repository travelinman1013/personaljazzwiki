## Biography
Brent Johnson is a South Texas-born blues and blues rock guitarist who began playing guitar at the age of four, displaying prodigious talent from an early age. After his family relocated to New Orleans during his teenage years, Johnson immersed himself in the city’s vibrant musical culture, drawing inspiration from a wide range of genres including blues, jazz, rock, punk, country, and world music. He formed several high school bands with a blues focus and gained local recognition performing with the group Under The Gun, which developed a strong following on the Louisiana live circuit.

Johnson’s career took a significant turn when he was discovered by the legendary 'Braille Blues Daddy' Bryan Lee, who recognized Johnson’s virtuosity and dedication to the blues. At 22, Johnson joined Bryan Lee and the Blues Power Band, touring and recording with them nationally and internationally for a decade. In 2014, Johnson released his debut album 'Set the World on Fire' with his band The Call Up, featuring Bill Blok (bass), John Perkins (drums), and Wayne Lohr (keyboards), as well as guest appearances by Alvin Youngblood Hart and Sonny Landreth. Johnson’s musical style is deeply rooted in the blues but incorporates elements of rock, funk, folk, and New Orleans R&B, emphasizing emotional authenticity and personal experience over strict adherence to tradition.

Known for his passionate and urgent playing, Johnson has established himself as a distinctive voice in contemporary blues, blending classic influences with a modern sensibility. His approach to music prioritizes feeling and directness, and he is celebrated for his dynamic live performances and soulful guitar work.
