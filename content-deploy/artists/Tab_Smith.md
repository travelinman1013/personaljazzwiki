## Biography
Talmadge "Tab" Smith (January 11, 1909 – August 17, 1971) was a prominent American alto saxophonist whose career bridged the worlds of swing, jazz, and rhythm and blues. Born in Kinston, North Carolina, into a musical family—his mother and four sisters were pianists—Smith began on piano before switching to saxophone as a teenager. He joined his first professional band, the Carolina Stompers, in 1929 and quickly became an in-demand performer, playing with groups such as Eddie Johnson’s Crackerjacks and on riverboats with Fate Marable.

Smith rose to national prominence in the 1930s and 1940s as a member of the bands led by Lucky Millinder and Count Basie, and he also freelanced as both a player and arranger. He participated in notable recording sessions with jazz greats including Billie Holiday, Earl Hines, and Coleman Hawkins. After World War II, Smith led his own groups, shifting towards rhythm and blues as jazz evolved. His biggest commercial success came in 1951 with his saxophone rendition of "Because of You," which topped the R&B charts and crossed over to the pop charts. Smith recorded prolifically for United Records until its closure in 1957, after which his career declined. He spent his later years in St. Louis, working in real estate and performing locally until his death in 1971.
