## Biography
Mohammed Ismail Sherif, professionally known as Black Sherif (formerly Blacko), was born on 9 January 2002 in Konongo-Zongo, Ashanti Region, Ghana. Raised primarily by his aunt and extended family due to his parents working overseas, he experienced a nomadic lifestyle that exposed him to diverse influences. He completed basic education at Konongo Zongo Islamic Basic School and Pinamang Educational Complex, secondary school at Kumasi Academy where he developed an interest in music through the Literary Group, and later studied at the University of Ghana after attending the University of Professional Studies.[1]

Black Sherif launched his career in 2019 with 'Cry for Me' on YouTube, followed by 'Money' in 2020. He gained traction in 2021 with 'First Sermon' and its sequel 'Second Sermon' (remixed with Burna Boy). His 2022 breakthrough single 'Kwaku the Traveller' topped charts in Ghana and Nigeria, leading to his debut album *The Villain I Never Was*. He released *Iron Boy* in 2025, performed at major events like Wireless Festival and MOBO Awards, and won awards including Best Hip Hop at the 2023 Soundcity MVP Awards. His style blends highlife, reggae, UK drill, and hip-hop, often in Twi, influenced by Kanye West, Travis Scott, and Ghanaian artists like Sarkodie.[1]

Seyi Vibez (Balogun Afolabi Oluwaloseyi), born 12 July 2000 in Ketu, Lagos State, Nigeria, and raised in Ikorodu, overcame financial hardships and personal losses, including his mother's death in 2023. He debuted in 2019 with 'Anybody', rose with 'Godsent' in 2020, and released albums like *No Seyi No Vibez* and *Billion Dollar Baby* (2022), with hits like 'Chance (Na Ham)'. Known for Afrobeat and street-hop, he won Best Street-Hop at the 2023 Headies and became Spotify Nigeria's second most streamed artist in 2025.[3]
