## Biography
Leo "Bud" Welch was born on March 22, 1932, in Sabougla, Mississippi, and grew up in a large family with seven sisters and four brothers. From an early age, Welch was drawn to music, learning to play guitar on a homemade one-string instrument crafted from hay baling wire, taught by his elder cousin L.C. By age 15, he was performing in public and had already attracted the attention of established musicians, even receiving an audition offer from B.B. King—a trip he could not afford to make. Welch spent much of his life working as a lumberjack and pulpwood tree logger, playing music primarily in church and at local gatherings, and never pursuing a professional career until much later in life.[1][2][3][4]

For decades, Welch's musical life was split between the blues and gospel traditions of Mississippi. He played blues at clubs and social events but focused on gospel music in church, particularly after 1975 when he began performing with groups like the Sabougla Voices and the Skuna Valley Male Chorus. His reputation for marathon performances and his ability to learn songs by ear were well known in his community. It was not until 2014, at the age of 81, that Welch released his debut album, "Sabougla Voices," on Big Legal Mess Records, followed by "I Don't Prefer No Blues" in 2015. His late-blooming recording career brought him international recognition, festival appearances, and a documentary film, "Late Blossom Blues." Welch passed away on December 19, 2017, in Bruce, Mississippi, leaving a legacy as a bridge between the sacred and secular roots of American music.[1][2][3][4]
