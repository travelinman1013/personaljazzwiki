## Biography
Mick Clarke, born July 12, 1950 in London, England, is a highly respected British blues guitarist and songwriter whose career has spanned over five decades. Clarke's passion for the blues was ignited as a teenager after hearing Eric Clapton, which inspired him to dedicate his life to the genre. He first gained prominence in the late 1960s as a founding member of Killing Floor, a band that became a staple of the British blues boom and backed legendary American artists such as Freddie King, Howlin' Wolf, and Otis Spann. Killing Floor released two influential albums before disbanding in the early 1970s, later reforming in the 2000s for new recordings and tours.

In the mid-1970s, Clarke co-founded the blues-rock act SALT and later played with RAMROD, collaborating with former members of Rory Gallagher's band. The early 1980s saw the formation of the Mick Clarke Band, which quickly gained a reputation across Europe and the United States for its fiery live performances and authentic blues sound. Clarke's solo career began with the album 'Looking For Trouble' and has continued with a prolific output of albums, many released on his own Rockfold label. Renowned for his raw, emotive guitar style, Clarke has performed at major festivals worldwide and shared stages with icons such as Johnny Winter, Rory Gallagher, Canned Heat, and Joe Bonamassa. His legacy is cemented as one of the elder statesmen of British blues, continually influencing the genre with both his recordings and live performances.
