## Biography
Brandee Younger is a pioneering American jazz harpist born and raised on Long Island, New York. Immersed in music from a young age, she sang in church choirs and studied classical harp, taking her early inspiration from both the French Impressionist and Baroque traditions. However, her artistic vision expanded dramatically as a teenager when her father introduced her to the music of Alice Coltrane, whose innovative approach to the harp in jazz became a defining influence on Younger's career[3][4][5].

Younger has become one of the most celebrated jazz harpists of her generation, following in the footsteps of Alice Coltrane and Dorothy Ashby while forging her own path. Since her debut with the EP 'Prelude' in 2011, she has developed a distinctive style that blends jazz with classical, R&B, hip-hop, and spirituals, earning critical acclaim as a composer, bandleader, and collaborator. Her versatility has led her to perform with jazz legends such as Jack DeJohnette, Pharoah Sanders, Reggie Workman, and Ravi Coltrane, as well as contribute to recordings by artists across genres, including Beyoncé, Lauryn Hill, Stevie Wonder, and The Roots[1][2][5].

In addition to her performing and recording career, Younger is an educator, serving on the faculty at New York University. Her work has helped redefine the harp's role in contemporary jazz, inspiring a new generation of musicians and expanding the instrument's expressive possibilities. She is a Grammy and NAACP Image Award nominee, and her ongoing projects continue to honor and amplify the legacies of her musical forebears while charting new territory for the jazz harp[2][4].
