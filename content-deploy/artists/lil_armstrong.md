# LIL ARMSTRONG

## Biography
Lillian Hardin Armstrong (February 3, 1898 – August 27, 1971) was born in Memphis, Tennessee, into a strict religious household where she discovered her musical talent early, playing a neglected harmonium and later studying piano formally. After attending Fisk University briefly, she moved to Chicago during the Great Migration around 1917-1918, securing a job demonstrating songs at Jones’s Music Store, where she encountered jazz luminaries like Jelly Roll Morton, whose rhythmic style influenced her playing. She progressed to gigs with Lawrence Duhé’s New Orleans Creole Band and then joined King Oliver’s Creole Jazz Band at Dreamland in 1921, a pivotal step in her career amid Chicago's vibrant jazz scene.[1][2][3]

Hardin married singer Jimmie Johnson briefly in 1922 before meeting Louis Armstrong, whom Oliver brought into the band as second cornetist. She encouraged the young trumpeter to assert himself, manage his finances, and leave Oliver's band, leading him to Fletcher Henderson in New York in 1924 and later his groundbreaking Hot Five recordings. They married in 1924, collaborating extensively in the 1920s on hits like 'Struttin’ with Some Barbecue,' which she composed. Hardin's style blended New Orleans jazz with swing elements, showcasing her skills as pianist, composer, arranger, singer, and bandleader. In the 1930s, she led an all-female orchestra, the Harlem Harlicans, and served as house pianist for Decca Records, accompanying artists like Alberta Hunter.[1][2][3]

Post-divorce from Louis in 1938, Hardin continued performing into the 1950s and 1960s, touring jazz festivals in the US and Europe, recording reminiscences, and seeing her compositions like 'Just for a Thrill' covered by Ray Charles and others. She died on August 27, 1971, after performing in Chicago. Her legacy endures as a key figure in jazz evolution, particularly for propelling Louis Armstrong toward improvisational innovation and establishing herself as a trailblazing female bandleader.[1][2][3]

## Fun Facts
- Lil started her musical journey playing an old harmonium she made 'moan and groan,' then imaginary pianos on windowsills and buckets before formal training.[3]
- She gave Louis Armstrong a complete 'visual makeover' to shed his 'country' look, boosting his star image upon his return from New York.[1][3]
- Hardin led the all-female Harlem Harlicans in Chicago (1931-1932) and was musical director for Decca's Sepia Series, accompanying blues greats like Georgia White.[2]
- She died on stage at 73 after a tribute concert to Louis Armstrong at Chicago's Labor Temple on August 27, 1971.[1]
