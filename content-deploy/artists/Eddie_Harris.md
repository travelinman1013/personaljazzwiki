## Biography
Eddie Harris was born on October 20, 1934, in Chicago, Illinois, where his early musical education began in Baptist churches and at home under the guidance of his cousin, who taught him piano by ear. He attended DuSable High School, where the influential music educator Captain Walter Dyett introduced him to the clarinet, vibraphone, and saxophone, shaping his foundational skills. After further studies at Illinois and Roosevelt Universities, Harris was drafted into the Army, where he excelled musically and performed with Army bands in Germany and France, even taking classical saxophone lessons at the Paris Conservatory.

Harris’s professional career took off with his 1961 recording of the theme from 'Exodus,' which became a pop hit and earned him a gold record. He became renowned for his technical innovation, being one of the first jazz musicians to amplify the saxophone with a Varitone attachment and inventing hybrid instruments like the 'reed trumpet.' His composition 'Freedom Jazz Dance' became a jazz standard after being recorded by Miles Davis. Harris's collaborations with pianist Les McCann, especially their 1969 album 'Swiss Movement' recorded live at the Montreux Jazz Festival, brought him international acclaim and a Grammy nomination. Throughout his career, Harris explored soul jazz, jazz funk, and hard bop, and was known for blending humor and experimentation into his performances.

Eddie Harris’s legacy is marked by his relentless innovation, genre-blending style, and influence on generations of jazz musicians. He continued to perform and record prolifically until his death in Los Angeles on November 5, 1996, leaving behind a body of work that remains vital to the evolution of modern jazz.
