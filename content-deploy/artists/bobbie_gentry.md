## Biography
Bobbie Gentry (born Roberta Lee Streeter on July 27, 1942, in Chickasaw County, Mississippi) is an American retired singer-songwriter who became one of the first female artists in the United States to compose and produce her own material. She rose to international fame in 1967 with her Southern Gothic narrative "Ode to Billie Joe," which spent four weeks at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and became the third biggest hit of 1967. The song earned her Grammy Awards for Best New Artist and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance in 1968, and the Academy of Country Music named her Top New Female Vocalist of 1967. Her Southern-themed narrative songs, including the classic "Fancy," showcased her distinctive storytelling style that blended country, pop, and blues elements.

Gentry's career fell into two distinct halves. During the first six years, she was primarily a recording artist, releasing seven albums on Capitol Records including her defining works "Ode to Billie Joe" (1967), "The Delta Sweete" (1968), and "Patchwork" (1971). "Patchwork" was particularly notable as her first entirely self-written and self-produced album, described as a collection of short stories in song stitched together with cinematic interludes. After releasing her final album in 1971, she reinvented herself as a live entertainer, starring in lavish stage productions primarily in Las Vegas throughout the remainder of the 1970s, where she broke attendance records in the mid-1970s. She created spectacular one-woman shows where she designed costumes, wrote and arranged music, choreographed dances, and produced entire theatrical experiences, negotiating her own multi-million dollar contracts that paid $1 million for 20 weeks of work per year.

A pioneer in multiple aspects of the entertainment industry, Gentry became the first female songwriter to host her own TV series on the BBC in 1968, at a time when television executives didn't believe a woman could front a prime-time program. She also hosted "The Bobbie Gentry Happiness Hour" on CBS in 1974, though it was not renewed for a full season. As a keen businesswoman, she established two music publishing companies organized beneath her parent company Gentry Ltd, which produced her live shows. In the late 1970s, she lost interest in performing and retired from the music industry. In the early 1980s, she completely withdrew from show business and has not performed or recorded since, maintaining her privacy and leaving behind a legacy as a groundbreaking artist who paved the way for female singer-songwriters in control of their own creative output.

## Fun Facts
- Elvis Presley himself witnessed one of her most talked-about live segments—a tribute to the King performed in Las Vegas during her stage career.
- She negotiated her own multi-million dollar Las Vegas contracts, earning $1 million for 20 weeks of work per year, but always refused to sign for longer than two-year periods to maintain creative control.
- Her lavish Las Vegas productions cost her over $200,000 per show to produce, featuring around eight dancers, five musicians, special effects, and elaborate sets—all designed, choreographed, and arranged by Gentry herself.
- She wrote and performed the haunting ending credits theme song "Another Day, Another Time" for the 1974 film "Macon County Line," and "Ode to Billie Joe" was adapted into a feature film in 1976.
