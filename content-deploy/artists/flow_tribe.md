## Biography
Flow Tribe is an American funk rock band formed in 2004 by high school friends from Brother Martin High School in New Orleans, Louisiana. Initially shelved after graduation, the project was revived in 2006 amid the devastation of Hurricane Katrina, as members returned to help rebuild the city. Eager to serve as cultural ambassadors, they hit the road, performing for music fans and displaced survivors across the Southeast, blending New Orleans' rhythmic spirit with genre-spanning 'backbone-cracking music' that mixes funk, rock, hip-hop, and soul.[1][2][3]

Over the years, Flow Tribe evolved into a national touring powerhouse, playing over 120 shows annually at major festivals like Voodoo Music Experience, New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival (since 2010, including the Acura Main Stage), French Quarter Festival (headliner since 2010), and Gretna Heritage Festival. Their 2017 album *BOSS*, produced by hip-hop legend Mannie Fresh, reached #58 on Billboard’s R&B Chart and inspired them to build their own Downman Sounds Studio to foster New Orleans' music scene. Known for high-energy live shows featuring traveling street parades, they released *Garden of Earthly Delights* in 2024, marking their 20th anniversary with collaborations like Ivan Neville on 'Keep Pushing.' Relix Magazine describes their sound as 'bizarrely irresistible.'[1][2]

The band's current lineup includes K.C. O'Rorke (vocals, trumpet), Scott Sibley (drums), Kyle Chervanik (bass, vocals), Evan Oberla (trombone, keys, vocals), and Bryan Santos (guitar), all New Orleans natives delivering resilient, road-tested funk.[1][4]
