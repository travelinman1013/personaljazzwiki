## Biography
James Edward "Sing" Miller (June 17, 1914 – May 18, 1990) was an American jazz pianist and vocalist who became a cornerstone of the New Orleans traditional jazz scene for over five decades.[1][2] Born in New Orleans, Miller initially trained on violin tuned like a ukulele before taking up banjo and string bass as a young musician. His childhood nickname "Sing" proved prophetic, as his vocal talents would ultimately define his artistic legacy despite his considerable instrumental abilities.[2] In 1927, Miller began his professional career as a banjo player at the Okey Lounge and joined Kid Howard's band, while simultaneously establishing his reputation as a vocalist with the Harmonizing Browns Quartet.[2] Beginning in 1928, Miller taught himself piano, drawing inspiration from neighboring blues pianist Stack O'Lee and other local pianists including Steve Lewis, Jeannette Kimball, and Isadore Washington.[2]

Throughout the 1930s and 1940s, Miller built an extensive résumé performing with many of New Orleans' most respected jazz musicians, including Percy Humphrey, Earl Foster, Kid Thomas Valentine, Kid Sheik Colar, and Jim Robinson.[1][2] His career was interrupted by military service during World War II from 1942 onward, but he resumed performing with Foster's ensemble following his discharge.[2] Miller's versatility allowed him to work across multiple venues and contexts—from the Carnival Club and Club Plantation in Bogalusa to tent shows touring throughout the South.[2] By the 1960s, he had become a regular fixture at Preservation Hall, where he performed frequently with Percy Humphrey, Kid Sheik, and other traditional jazz luminaries until the end of his life.[1][2]

Miller's artistic contributions were recognized through two solo albums that captured his definitive work: a 1972 recording for Dixie Records and *Old Times with Sing Miller*, released on Smoky Mary Records in 1975, featuring his vocals and piano alongside Frank Demond (trombone), James Prevost (bass), and Louis Barbarin (drums).[2] Ethnomusicologist Alan Lomax, after witnessing Miller perform at Lincoln Center in New York, was moved to tears by the beauty and emotional depth of his singing, describing his voice as "a sunburst of the soul."[2] Miller remained active until his death on May 18, 1990, leaving behind a legacy as one of New Orleans' most respected traditional jazz performers.[1][2]
