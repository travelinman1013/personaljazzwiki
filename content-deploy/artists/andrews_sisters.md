## Biography
The Andrews Sisters were an iconic American close harmony singing group consisting of three sisters: contralto LaVerne Sophia Andrews (1911–1967), soprano Maxene Anglyn Andrews (1916–1995), and mezzo-soprano Patricia Marie 'Patty' Andrews (1918–2013), born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, to Greek immigrant parents Peter and Olga Andrews.[3] They began performing locally in the late 1920s and gained early experience touring with vaudeville troupes led by Larry Rich in 1931 and others, rehearsing daily and honing their craft through fairs, clubs, and dance bands during the Great Depression.[2][3][4] Their breakthrough came in 1937 with the Decca Records hit 'Bei Mir Bist Du Schön,' a Yiddish tune adapted to English, which topped Billboard charts for five weeks, sold 350,000 copies, and launched them to national fame as swing and boogie-woogie stars.[1][2][3]

In the 1940s, the sisters dominated the music scene, recording over 700 songs (some sources cite up to 1,800), selling 75–100 million records, earning 9–19 gold discs, charting 113 Billboard hits (46 in the Top 10), and starring in 17 Hollywood films, more than any other singing group.[3] Hits like 'Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy,' 'Rum and Coca-Cola,' and 'I Can Dream, Can't I?' defined their upbeat, harmonious style blending big band, swing, and pop, while they boosted wartime morale through radio shows, V-Discs for troops, and performances at the Hollywood Canteen.[2][3] Challenges arose in the early 1950s with arranger Vic Schoen's departure and internal tensions, leading Patty to leave for a solo career in 1953–1954; Maxene and LaVerne continued briefly before reuniting in 1956 with Capitol Records, though rock-and-roll overshadowed their later work.[1][2][3]

The group disbanded after LaVerne's death in 1967, but their legacy endures as the best-selling female vocal group until the Beatles, celebrated for tight harmonies, humor, and bringing joy during tough times, with enduring popularity in genres like swing, big band, and Christmas music.[2][3][5]

- Dubbed 'Sweethearts of the Armed Forces Radio Service,' they volunteered for V-Discs, Hollywood Canteen performances, and treated random servicemen to dinners while touring.[3]
- Nearly quit in 1937 to become secretaries but were discovered by music publisher Lou Levy on radio the day they planned to leave, leading to their Decca audition.[4]
