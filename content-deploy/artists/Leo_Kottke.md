## Biography
Leo Kottke, born September 11, 1945, in Athens, Georgia, is a renowned American acoustic guitarist celebrated for his virtuosic fingerpicking style that fuses elements of blues, jazz, and folk music. Raised in twelve different states due to his family's frequent moves, Kottke developed an early appreciation for music, learning trombone and violin before settling on the guitar as his primary instrument. Influenced by the likes of Mississippi John Hurt, he began performing in coffeehouses in the Minneapolis area in the late 1960s, where he recorded his debut album, '12-String Blues,' in 1969.

Kottke's breakthrough came with the release of '6- and 12-String Guitar' on John Fahey's Takoma Records, earning him a reputation for his syncopated, polyphonic melodies and unconventional techniques. Despite overcoming significant personal challenges—including partial hearing loss and a debilitating bout of tendonitis that forced him to alter his playing style—Kottke continued to innovate, blending classical and jazz influences into his work. Over his prolific career, he has released numerous albums, collaborated with artists such as Mike Gordon of Phish, and performed internationally, becoming a key figure in the evolution of contemporary acoustic guitar.

Kottke's legacy is marked by his technical mastery, genre-defying compositions, and enduring influence on generations of guitarists. His ability to transcend musical boundaries while maintaining a distinct, self-sufficient sound has inspired countless musicians and earned him accolades as one of the foremost fingerstyle guitarists in the world.
