## Biography
Jamie Saft, Steve Swallow, and Bobby Previte form a distinctive jazz trio that bridges generations and genres, each bringing decades of experience and innovation to the group. Jamie Saft, a pianist and keyboardist known for his versatility and genre-blending approach, has collaborated with a wide range of artists from John Zorn to the Beastie Boys, and is recognized for his fearless pursuit of musical exploration. Steve Swallow, a pioneering electric bassist, has been a key figure in jazz since the 1960s, celebrated for his melodic approach to the bass and his work with legends like Gary Burton and Carla Bley. Bobby Previte, a drummer and composer, is renowned for his adventurous spirit and technical prowess, moving fluidly between jazz, rock, and experimental music.

The trio first recorded together on 'The New Standard' (2014), followed by 'Loneliness Road' (2017) and 'You Don’t Know the Life' (2019), all released on RareNoise Records. Their music is characterized by a deep sense of improvisational interplay, drawing on the American songbook, blues, folk, and avant-garde traditions. Saft’s keyboard work—ranging from piano to Hammond B3 organ—melds with Swallow’s lyrical bass and Previte’s dynamic drumming to create a sound that is both rooted in jazz history and boldly forward-looking. The trio has also collaborated with Iggy Pop, who contributed vocals to several tracks on 'Loneliness Road.'

Their legacy lies in their ability to synthesize diverse influences into a cohesive, innovative whole, challenging the boundaries of the traditional piano trio format. Critics have noted their "continual improvisational surprises" and the way they "thumb their noses at slavish period awareness," instead creating music that is historically informed yet strikingly original.
