## Biography
Ramsey Lewis, born Ramsey Emmanuel Lewis Jr. on May 27, 1935, in Chicago, Illinois, began piano lessons at age four and joined his first jazz band, The Cleffs, at 15. After graduating from Wells High School in 1954 and briefly attending Chicago Music College and DePaul University, he formed the Ramsey Lewis Trio in 1956 with bassist Eldee Young and drummer Isaac 'Redd' Holt, signing with Chess Records' Argo subsidiary for their debut album, Ramsey Lewis and the Gentlemen of Swing[1][2][3][4]. The trio started as a straight-ahead jazz group but achieved crossover success in 1965 with their live version of 'The In Crowd,' which hit #5 on the pop charts, won a Grammy for Best Jazz Performance, and earned a gold record, followed by hits like 'Hang On Sloopy' and 'Wade in the Water'[1][2][4][6].

After Young and Holt departed in 1966 to form Young-Holt Unlimited, Lewis recruited bassist Cleveland Eaton and drummer Maurice White, shifting toward soul jazz and pop-influenced material while maintaining high musical standards[1][3][4]. White later left to co-found Earth, Wind & Fire, replaced by Morris Jennings, and Lewis experimented with electronic keyboards on his 1974 album Sun Goddess, produced by White and featuring Earth, Wind & Fire[4][6]. The original trio reunited for a 1983 album, and Lewis continued a prolific career, recording for labels like Columbia and GRP, earning three Grammys, five gold records, and NEA Jazz Master status[2][3][4].

Known for blending jazz with soul, pop, and classical elements—exemplified in albums like Bach to the Blues—Lewis became an iconic figure in contemporary jazz over five decades, with genres including soul jazz and jazz, and a Spotify popularity of 54[1][3][4][8].
