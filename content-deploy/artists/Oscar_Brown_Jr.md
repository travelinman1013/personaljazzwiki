## Biography
Oscar Brown, Jr. (October 10, 1926 – May 29, 2005) was a pioneering American singer, songwriter, playwright, poet, actor, and civil rights activist, celebrated for his innovative blending of jazz, blues, gospel, and folk influences. Born on Chicago’s South Side to a prominent attorney and real estate broker, Brown showed early talent in writing and performance, making his radio debut at age 15 on Studs Terkel’s 'Secret City.' Although his father hoped he would pursue law, Brown’s passion led him to the arts, and after brief studies at the University of Wisconsin–Madison and Lincoln University, he left academia to pursue broadcasting, becoming the nation’s first Black newscaster on 'Negro Newsfront.'[1][2][3][4][5]

Brown’s musical career gained momentum in the late 1950s when Mahalia Jackson recorded his song 'Brown Baby,' prompting him to focus on songwriting and performance. He collaborated with jazz luminary Max Roach on the landmark 'We Insist! Freedom Now Suite,' one of the first jazz works to address civil rights themes. Over his prolific career, Brown released 12 albums, wrote more than 125 published songs, and created over a dozen musical plays, often using his art to celebrate African-American life and challenge racism. His signature style combined storytelling, humor, and social commentary, making his performances both entertaining and thought-provoking.[2][3][4]

Brown’s legacy endures through his influence on generations of artists and his commitment to using music and theater as tools for social change. He is also credited with discovering The Jackson 5 and remained active in civic life, running for political office and producing works that addressed the Black experience in America.[1][3][4]
