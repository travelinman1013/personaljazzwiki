## Biography
Cecilia Victoria Della Peruti, known by her stage name Gothic Tropic, is an American singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist born in New Jersey to Italian heritage and raised in the Los Angeles music scene. Growing up immersed in LA's vibrant music environment, she initially pursued visual arts at art school, though her passion for music soon took precedence, leading her to develop her skills as a guitarist and vocalist.[1][6][8] Gothic Tropic began as Della Peruti's solo loop station jams, evolving into a Los Angeles-based trio blending psych-pop with hard edges, drawing from high-energy afro-cuban beats, exuberant guitars, and pre-punk 1970s acts like Television, Captain Beefheart, and Can.[2][7]

The project quickly gained traction with the release of the debut 'Awesome Problems EP,' showcasing Della Peruti's unique lead guitar and vocal style that keeps a measured, darkly bizarre vibe. She has performed alongside prominent indie artists and collaborated with figures like Beck, solidifying her place in the indie music world as a bad-ass guitarist and frontwoman with dreamy vocals and spirited riffs.[2][3][4][5] Bassist Daniel Denton from Metric and drummer Liv Marisco from Cold War Kids joined to push the band's evolution into one of LA's exciting new acts.[2]

Gothic Tropic's musical style defies simple categorization, encapsulated by its name under an indie pop umbrella but incorporating gothic and tropic elements for a distinctive sound. While still emerging, her work has carved an interesting niche, premiering tracks and discussing industry experiences in interviews.[6][7]
