## Biography
The Daiquiri Queens are an all-female Cajun music band formed in South Louisiana through close friendships and a shared passion for classic Cajun dance music. Emerging from informal backyard jam sessions, the group debuted publicly at the 2017 South Louisiana Blackpot Festival, quickly gaining recognition for their old-school Cajun sound[1][2]. Their music blends traditional Cajun elements with a fresh, energetic twist delivered by an all-women lineup, appealing to fans of authentic regional dancehall styles[2].

The band's career has centered on live performances at key Louisiana festivals, including Festivals Acadiens et Créoles and the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival in 2022, where they were highlighted alongside other Cajun acts like Jambalaya[1][3]. They released their self-titled album in June 2020, featuring tracks such as 'Mes deux beaux-frères,' 'Chère bébe,' and 'Une femme avec un cœur casse,' which showcase their dedication to classic Cajun repertoire[5]. Specializing in genres like Cajun and zydeco, they maintain a niche popularity focused on preserving and revitalizing traditional sounds[context].

While still a relatively new ensemble since 2017, the Daiquiri Queens have established a legacy as a vibrant, female-led force in Cajun music, bringing renewed energy to backyard traditions on festival stages across Louisiana[1][2].
