## Biography
Bill Evans (August 16, 1929 – September 15, 1980) was an American jazz pianist and composer born in Plainfield, New Jersey, who became one of the most influential pianists of his generation. After studying classical music at Southeastern Louisiana College and the Mannes School of Music in New York City, where he majored in composition, Evans moved to New York in 1955 and quickly gained recognition through his work with bandleader and theorist George Russell. His breakthrough came in 1958 when he joined Miles Davis's sextet, contributing significantly to the landmark 1959 album Kind of Blue, which became the best-selling jazz album of all time and established modal jazz as a major force in the genre.

Evans is best known for his innovative approach to jazz trio performance and his revolutionary harmonic concepts. In late 1959, he formed a seminal trio with bassist Scott LaFaro and drummer Paul Motian, recording the classic albums Portrait in Jazz (1959) and Explorations (1961), as well as two albums from a historic 1961 engagement at New York's Village Vanguard: Sunday at the Village Vanguard and Waltz for Debby. His extensive use of impressionist harmony, block chords, innovative chord voicings, and trademark rhythmically independent melodic lines created a conversational style of interplay that went beyond traditional piano trio conventions. Evans recorded over fifty albums as a leader and received five Grammy Awards throughout his career.

Jim Hall (December 4, 1930 – December 2, 2013) was an American jazz guitarist born in Buffalo, New York, who became renowned for his subtle, lyrical approach to the instrument. Hall studied classical guitar and later developed his distinctive cool jazz style, becoming known for his sophisticated harmonic sensibility and restrained, conversational playing. His most celebrated collaboration with Bill Evans was the album Undercurrent (1962), which has been described as subtly altering the course of jazz forever. Hall's career spanned decades, during which he worked with numerous jazz luminaries and became recognized as one of the most influential guitarists in jazz history.

## Fun Facts

- The Bill Evans Trio's 1961 recording session at New York's Village Vanguard was so prolific that it yielded two classic albums from a single engagement: Sunday at the Village Vanguard and Waltz for Debby.
- Evans's collaboration with guitarist Jim Hall on the album Undercurrent (1962) was so influential that Hall himself described it as having 'subtly altered the course of jazz forever,' despite the album's relatively understated presentation.
- Evans recorded over fifty albums as a leader and won five Grammy Awards, establishing himself as the most important jazz pianist of his generation and creating a lasting influence on subsequent generations of jazz pianists.
