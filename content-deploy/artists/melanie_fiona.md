## Biography
Melanie Fiona Hallim, born July 4, 1983, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, to Guyanese immigrant parents, grew up in a multicultural environment that shaped her musical passion. Her father played in a soul/reggae/calypso band on weekends, and her mother loved big-voiced singers, inspiring Fiona from a young age. She began writing songs at 16, performed in Toronto nightclubs, and briefly joined the girl group X-Quisite in 2002. Initially recording reggae as Syren Hall, she co-wrote for artists like Rihanna and Kardinal Offishall before seeking a solo deal in Los Angeles in 2005, wary of labels altering her identity.[1][2][5]

Signed to SRC Records and Universal Motown in 2007 after entrepreneur Steve Rifkind discovered her, Fiona met Jay-Z, joining Roc Nation management. Her debut album, *The Bridge* (2009), featured producers like Salaam Remi and Future Cut, with 'It Kills Me' peaking at #1 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart and earning a Grammy nomination for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance. Her sophomore album, *The MF Life* (2012), included hits like 'Gone and Never Coming Back' and '4 AM'. She toured with Kanye West, Alicia Keys, Mary J. Blige, and D’Angelo, blending R&B, soul, and reggae influences in her honest, emotive style.[1][2]

Post-2012, Fiona faced vocal issues from stress and people-pleasing, leading to a mental breakdown; Eastern medicine and spiritual healing restored her voice. She left her major label for independence, embracing a boutique career while acting in shows like *American Soul* and marrying Jared Cotter in 2020, with whom she has two children. Her legacy endures through commercial success, vocal prowess, and advocacy for mental health in music.[3][4]
