## Biography
Alien Sex Fiend is a pioneering British band formed in North London in 1982 by Nik Fiend (Nik Wade, vocals), Mrs. Fiend (Christine Wade, keyboards), Yaxi Highrizer (David James, guitar), and Johnny Ha Ha (John Freshwater, drums). Their debut performance at the Batcave club in December 1982 placed them at the heart of the burgeoning gothic and deathrock scene, where their theatrical stage presence and macabre, campy aesthetic quickly set them apart. The band’s early sound fused punk, gothic rock, and electronic elements, characterized by Nik Fiend’s phantasmagoric vocals and Mrs. Fiend’s inventive use of synthesizers and drum machines, creating a style that was both danceable and darkly humorous.

Alien Sex Fiend’s 1983 debut single, 'Ignore the Machine,' produced by Youth of Killing Joke, and their first album, 'Who’s Been Sleeping in My Brain?', established their reputation for blending B-movie imagery, psychedelic guitar, and pulsing rhythms. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the group released a prolific stream of albums and singles, including club favorites like 'R.I.P.', 'Dead and Buried', and 'Now I’m Feeling Zombified.' Their music evolved to incorporate more electronic and industrial influences, notably on albums like 'Acid Bath' and the ambient-techno 'Nocturnal Emissions.' Alien Sex Fiend’s legacy is marked by their relentless innovation, cult following, and influence on the gothic, industrial, and post-punk genres, as well as their role in shaping the Batcave scene and the wider goth subculture.
