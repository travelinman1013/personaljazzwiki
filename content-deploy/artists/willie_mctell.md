## Biography
Blind Willie McTell (born William Samuel McTier, May 5, 1898 or 1901 – August 19, 1959) was a pioneering American blues and ragtime singer, songwriter, and guitarist, best known for his fluid, syncopated fingerpicking style on the twelve-string guitar. Born in the Happy Valley community outside Thomson, Georgia, McTell was blind from birth or early childhood. He moved with his mother to Statesboro, Georgia, where he learned guitar from her and local musicians. Despite his disability, McTell attended schools for the blind in Georgia, New York, and Michigan, learning to read and write music in Braille and developing a remarkable independence and musical versatility.[1][2][3][4]

McTell began performing in his teens, playing at carnivals, medicine shows, and on the streets of Georgia cities such as Augusta and Atlanta. He made his first recordings in 1927 for Victor Records, including the iconic 'Statesboro Blues.' Over his career, McTell recorded more than 120 songs across various labels, often using different pseudonyms. His repertoire spanned blues, ragtime, gospel, folk ballads, and popular music, and he was known for his clear tenor voice, which contrasted with the rougher vocals of Delta bluesmen. Despite limited commercial success, McTell remained active through the 1940s and 1950s, performing at house parties, rent gatherings, and on the street, often with longtime collaborator Curley Weaver. He died in 1959 in Georgia, leaving a legacy that would later be celebrated by a new generation of musicians and inducted into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame.[1][2][3][4]

McTell's innovative guitar work and expressive singing made him a central figure in the Piedmont blues tradition. His influence extended far beyond his lifetime, inspiring artists in the blues revival of the 1960s and beyond, and his songs—most notably 'Statesboro Blues'—became standards in American music.[1][2][5]
