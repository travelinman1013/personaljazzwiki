## Biography
The Jazz Crusaders were an American jazz group formed in the early 1950s by Houston schoolmates **Joe Sample** (piano), **Wilton Felder** (tenor saxophone), **Nesbert “Stix” Hooper** (drums), and **Wayne Henderson** (trombone), all raised in Houston’s Fifth Ward.[1][2] As teenagers at Smith Junior High School, Phyllis Wheatley High School, and later Texas Southern University, they first played together as **The Swingsters**, mixing jazz, blues, and Southern R&B in what they later called a distinctive “Gulf Coast sound.”[1][2] Expanding their lineup with bass and woodwinds, they briefly worked as the **Modern Jazz Sextet**, sharpening their hard bop approach before relocating from Houston to Los Angeles in the late 1950s to pursue a professional career.[1][2] After a stint as the **Nite Hawks/Hollywood Night Hawks** playing hotel and club gigs between Los Angeles and Las Vegas, saxophonist Curtis Amy helped them secure an audition with Pacific Jazz’s Dick Bock; in 1961 they adopted the name **The Jazz Crusaders** to reflect their mission of spreading jazz, and recorded their debut album *Freedom Sound*, an energetic blend of hard bop, gospel, blues, and R&B-influenced melodies.[1][2]

Throughout the 1960s, The Jazz Crusaders became known for their acoustic, trombone-and-tenor-fronted hard bop and soul-jazz, releasing nineteen albums between 1961 and 1970 (sixteen on the Pacific Jazz label) and developing a recognizable sound rooted in bebop, R&B, and church-inflected gospel feeling.[1][3][4] In 1971 they shortened their name to **The Crusaders**, embraced electric instruments, and moved decisively into jazz-funk and jazz-rock fusion, with Joe Sample on electric piano and key contributions from electric guitarist Larry Carlton and bassist Robert “Pops” Popwell.[1][3][5] Their 1970s albums crossed over onto jazz and pop charts, and in 1975 they became the first and only instrumental group to tour with the Rolling Stones, underscoring their broad appeal.[1] The group’s commercial peak came with the 1979 album **Street Life**, whose title track featuring vocalist Randy Crawford became a Top 40 pop single and a signature jazz-funk anthem.[1][2] Personnel changes followed—Wayne Henderson left in 1975, Stix Hooper in 1983—and the original band wound down after the 1991 album *Healing the Wounds*.[1][5] Henderson later revived the **Jazz Crusaders** name in the mid‑1990s, while various reunions of original members appeared on recordings such as *Rural Renewal* (2003) and in tours through 2010, cementing the group’s legacy as pioneers of hard bop–to–fusion evolution whose sophisticated yet groove-heavy music remains influential in jazz, soul, and fusion circles.[1][5]

## Fun Facts
- Before becoming The Jazz Crusaders, the core members cycled through multiple names—including The Swingsters, the Modern Jazz Sextet, and the Nite Hawks/Hollywood Night Hawks—as they shifted between jazz, R&B, and dance‑band gigs.[1][2]
- Their 1979 hit “Street Life,” featuring Randy Crawford, not only became their best‑known recording but also reached the Top 40 of the pop singles chart while the album hit the Top 20 on jazz, pop, and Black album charts, an unusual crossover feat for a jazz-rooted group.[1]
- In 1975 the Crusaders became the first and only purely instrumental group to tour with the Rolling Stones, demonstrating how far their jazz‑funk sound had penetrated the rock mainstream.[1]
- Wayne Henderson revived the Jazz Crusaders name in 1995 without Joe Sample’s approval, leading to a period where Henderson’s **Jazz Crusaders** and a later Sample–Felder–Hooper **Crusaders** lineup coexisted, sometimes confusing fans about which group was the “official” continuation.[1][5]
