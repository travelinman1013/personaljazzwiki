## Biography
Jack Teagarden, born Weldon Leo Teagarden on August 20, 1905, in Vernon, Texas, emerged from a musically gifted family—his mother was a ragtime pianist and his siblings also became professional musicians. Teagarden began playing piano at age five, switched to baritone horn by seven or eight, and settled on trombone by age ten, performing in theaters with his mother and later providing live soundtracks for silent films. By his mid-teens, he was already performing professionally in Houston with Peck Kelly’s Bad Boys, and his early exposure to tent revival music and the records of Louis Armstrong and Bessie Smith deeply shaped his musical sensibilities.

Teagarden’s career took off after his move to New York in 1927, where his innovative trombone style—marked by a relaxed, lyrical phrasing and technical mastery—quickly gained attention. He joined Ben Pollack’s orchestra, outplaying Glenn Miller for the first trombone seat, and became a sought-after studio musician, recording with jazz luminaries such as Red Nichols, Benny Goodman, Bix Beiderbecke, and Billie Holiday. In 1933, he joined Paul Whiteman’s orchestra for five years before forming his own band in 1939, which, despite its musical innovation, struggled financially. Teagarden later joined Louis Armstrong’s All-Stars, contributing to classic recordings and touring internationally with his own All Stars Dixieland Band in the 1950s.

Teagarden’s legacy lies in his pioneering approach to jazz trombone, blending Dixieland, swing, and early bebop influences, and in his soulful, blues-inflected singing. He was among the first white jazz musicians to participate in racially integrated recording sessions, and his artistry inspired generations of trombonists and jazz singers. Though not as commercially successful as some contemporaries, Teagarden is widely regarded as one of the greatest jazz trombonists in history.

## Fun Facts
- Jack Teagarden was among the first white jazz musicians to participate in racially integrated recording sessions, notably with Louis Armstrong and Bessie Smith.
- He developed a distinctive trombone technique that included using a drinking glass as a mute for a unique sound.
- Teagarden’s siblings—Norma (piano), Charlie (trumpet), and Clois 'Cub' (drums)—were all professional musicians, and they occasionally performed together.
- His 1931 recording of 'Beale Street Blues' is celebrated not only for his trombone playing but also for his soulful vocal performance.
