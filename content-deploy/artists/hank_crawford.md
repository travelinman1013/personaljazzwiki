## Biography
Bennie Ross Crawford Jr., known professionally as Hank Crawford, was born on December 21, 1934, in Memphis, Tennessee, and became one of the most distinctive alto saxophonists in soul jazz and hard bop music.[1][2] Crawford began his musical education early, studying piano formally at age nine and soon performing for his church choir. He took up the alto saxophone during his high school years at Manassas High School, where he played alongside formidable young talent including pianist Harold Mabern and tenor saxophonist George Coleman.[2] His early musical foundation was shaped by bebop, blues, and country music, influences that would define his signature sound throughout his career.

Crawford's breakthrough came in 1958 when Ray Charles discovered him performing in Nashville and invited him to join his band as a baritone saxophonist.[1][3] This pivotal moment proved transformative; Crawford served not only as a saxophonist but also as an arranger and musical director for Charles, becoming the first stand-up band leader Charles employed.[2] During his time with Charles from 1958 to 1963, Crawford absorbed invaluable lessons in discipline, phrasing, and soulful voicing that would become hallmarks of his style.[1] After leaving Charles in 1963, Crawford embarked on a prolific solo career, recording extensively for Atlantic Records (1960-1970), Kudu Records, and Milestone Records (beginning 1982).[1][2] He became known for his piercing, full-bodied tone that blended blues, soul, and gospel elements, creating music that appealed to average listeners rather than jazz purists.[2] Crawford recorded numerous albums and collaborated frequently with organist Jimmy McGriff beginning in 1986, producing four co-leader albums for Milestone Records.[1][4] He also performed and recorded with notable artists including Dr. John, B.B. King, Etta James, Eric Clapton, and "Fathead" Newman.[2] Crawford died on January 29, 2009, in Memphis at age 74, leaving behind a legacy as one of soul jazz's most recognizable and influential voices.[1][2]

## Fun Facts
- Crawford received his nickname 'Hank' because his saxophone sound resembled that of Hank O'Day, a local Memphis musician, rather than being derived from his first name.[2]
- Before joining Ray Charles, Crawford was discovered performing at the Subway Lounge in Nashville by country producer Roy Hall, who recorded him as a featured vocalist on the singles 'The House of Pink Lights' and 'Christine' for a local label.[1]
- Crawford was recommended to Ray Charles as a one-night replacement when baritone saxophonist Leroy 'Hog' Cooper left the band in 1958; Charles was so impressed that he asked Crawford to join permanently just three months later, causing Crawford to leave Tennessee State University as a college senior.[2]
- Crawford consciously played for 'the average listener, rather than the jazz die-hard,' believing that if music wasn't making people tap their feet and connect emotionally, 'then there was nothing happening'—a philosophy that guided his accessible yet artistically sophisticated approach to soul jazz.[2]
