## Biography
John Craigie is an American singer-songwriter and storyteller known for his witty, narrative-driven folk songs and engaging live performances. Born and raised in Los Angeles, California, he grew up in Southern California’s laid‑back environment, learning guitar from a friend in high school and discovering that he could write and perform his own songs.[3][4][8] He later studied mathematics at the University of California, Santa Cruz, where the supportive campus culture, local music scene, and eclectic radio station KPIG-FM deepened his interest in folk, blues, rock, and Americana and helped him gain confidence as a writer and performer.[3][4] While at UCSC he played in a jam band called Pond Rock with friends, performing at house parties and campus events, and began blending poetry and song in his work.[3]

After graduating with a degree in mathematics, Craigie worked at UC Santa Cruz and then taught math at Watsonville High School until he had saved enough to buy a van and embark on a solo touring life, playing coffee shops and bars around the United States.[3] He gradually built a career as a modern-day troubadour, touring extensively across all 50 U.S. states and internationally, and releasing a prolific catalog of studio, live, and cover albums on his own independent label.[1][3] In 2015 he settled in Portland, Oregon, drawn by its thriving music community and creative scene, and recorded the warmly received album “No Rain, No Rose” in the old Victorian house he calls home, emphasizing community and collaboration.[1][4] His later work includes the 2024 album “Pagan Church,” recorded with members of TK & The Holy Know-Nothings, and Beatles tribute “Beatles Lonely” performances of “Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band” and “Abbey Road” recorded live for special vinyl releases.[2][3]

Craigie’s musical style sits in the folk and Americana tradition, often compared to artists like John Prine, Woody Guthrie, Arlo Guthrie, and Todd Snider for his blend of simple, acoustic instrumentation, observational lyrics, and a mix of humor and seriousness.[1] His songs frequently draw on life on the road, specific places, and contemporary everyday situations, using storytelling and dry humor to make personal experiences feel universal.[1][6][8] Alongside his studio output, he is especially known for his live shows, where between-song stories are as much a part of the experience as the songs themselves, and for community-oriented projects such as his annual Keep It Warm tour supporting regional nonprofits that address food insecurity and homelessness.[3][5] Through his steady touring, collaborative spirit, and narrative songwriting, Craigie has established himself as a respected modern folk voice and a quintessential independent troubadour.
