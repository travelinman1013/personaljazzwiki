## Biography
Precious Bryant (née Bussey; January 4, 1942 – January 12, 2013) was a celebrated American country blues, gospel, and folk singer and guitarist, renowned for her mastery of the Piedmont fingerstyle guitar. Born in Talbot County, Georgia, Bryant was the third of nine children in a deeply musical family. She began singing in her local Baptist church with her sisters and learned guitar from her father and uncle, blues musician George Henry Bussey, becoming proficient by age nine. Bryant left high school in the eleventh grade, married in 1965, and soon began performing locally, developing a repertoire that blended traditional songs with her own original compositions.

Bryant's career took a significant turn when folklorist George Mitchell recorded her in 1967, recognizing her as a 'Georgia musical treasure.' After a pivotal performance at the Chattahoochee Folk Festival in 1983, she gained wider recognition and began performing at regional, national, and international festivals. In 1995, her association with the Music Maker Relief Foundation helped her reach new audiences and facilitated global tours. Bryant released three solo albums, with her 2002 debut 'Fool Me Good' earning two Blues Music Award nominations. Her music, marked by honest storytelling and a deep connection to Georgia's blues tradition, left a lasting legacy in American roots music.
