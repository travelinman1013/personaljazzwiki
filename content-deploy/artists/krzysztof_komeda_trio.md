## Biography
Krzysztof Komeda (born Krzysztof Trzciński on 27 April 1931 in Poznań, Poland – died 23 April 1969 in Warsaw) was a Polish film score composer and jazz pianist widely regarded as one of the most influential Polish jazz musicians and a pioneering figure in European modern jazz. Despite training as a doctor, Komeda's passion for jazz led him to become a central figure in Poland's underground jazz scene during the Stalinist era, performing in clandestine jam sessions known as the "Catacomb Era" alongside musicians such as saxophonist Jerzy Dudus Matuszkiewicz and pianist Andrzej Trzaskowski in the early postwar Melomani ensemble. His breakthrough came in August 1956 at the Sopot Jazz Festival, where his Komeda Sextet performed as Poland's first modern jazz ensemble, combining the cool jazz aesthetics of the Gerry Mulligan Quartet and Modern Jazz Quartet with a distinctly European sensibility that helped legitimize jazz in Poland during the post-Khrushchev thaw.

Komeda's musical style synthesized American modern jazz with European classical traditions and Polish folk elements, creating a unique aesthetic that distinguished him from his American contemporaries. He adopted the stage name "Komeda" while working at a laryngological clinic to conceal his jazz activities from colleagues during a period when jazz faced social and political scrutiny. Throughout the late 1950s and 1960s, Komeda established himself as both a virtuoso pianist and innovative composer, performing extensively across Scandinavia and Europe at venues including the Café Montmartre in Copenhagen and the Golden Circle in Stockholm. His 1965 album *Astigmatic*, recorded with trumpeter Tomasz Stańko and saxophonist Zbigniew Namysłowski, is considered one of the most important European jazz albums, marking what British critic Stuart Nicholson describes as "a shift away from the dominant American approach with the emergence of a specific European aesthetic."

Beyond his jazz career, Komeda became renowned as a film composer, scoring 65 films including four collaborations with director Roman Polanski: *Knife in the Water* (1962), *Cul-de-sac* (1966), *The Fearless Vampire Killers* (1967), and *Rosemary's Baby* (1968), the latter featuring his famous "Lullaby" as a recurring motif. His career was cut short by his premature death in 1969, but his influence was revived internationally in 1997 when trumpeter Tomasz Stańko released the acclaimed album *Litania: Music of Krzysztof Komeda* on the ECM label, reestablishing Komeda's significance in European jazz history.

## Fun Facts
- Komeda adopted his stage name while working as a doctor at a laryngological clinic to conceal his jazz activities from colleagues, as jazz faced social and political scrutiny in communist Poland during the early postwar period.
- The 1956 Sopot Jazz Festival, where Komeda's Sextet performed as Poland's first modern jazz ensemble, took place just two months before the Hungarian uprising was crushed by Soviet tanks, occurring during a brief window of cultural liberalization following Khrushchev's rise to power.
- Komeda's famous "Lullaby" from the film Rosemary's Baby (1968) became a recurring motif throughout the film and is considered one of his most iconic compositions, showcasing his ability to blend jazz sensibilities with film scoring.
- Despite his premature death in 1969, Komeda's international reputation was dramatically revived over 25 years later when trumpeter Tomasz Stańko released Litania: Music of Krzysztof Komeda in 1997 on the prestigious ECM label, which met with huge international acclaim and reawakened global interest in his work.
