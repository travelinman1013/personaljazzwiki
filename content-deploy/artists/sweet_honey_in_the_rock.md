## Biography
Sweet Honey in the Rock is an all-female African-American a cappella ensemble founded in 1973 in Washington, D.C., by Bernice Johnson Reagon during a vocal workshop with the D.C. Black Repertory Company. Originally starting with four women—Reagon, Louise Robinson, Carol Lynn Maillard, and Mie Fredericks—the group drew its name from Psalm 81:16, symbolizing a land of abundance where honey flows from rock, reflecting the power of their blended voices and the strength of Black women. Reagon, a composer, historian, musician, and activist with roots in the Civil Rights Movement, shaped the group's early direction, building on her prior experience founding the Harambee Singers at Spelman College in 1966.[1][2][4]

The ensemble evolved from four to five-part harmonies, with a sixth member providing American Sign Language interpretation, expanding to 25 vocalists over five decades while maintaining its core mission of expressing Black women's history through song, dance, and activism. They recorded 24 albums, including their self-titled debut (1976), and became internationally renowned, touring worldwide and earning three Grammy nominations for their blend of spirituals, children's songs, traditional African and African American music, and socially conscious lyrics addressing justice, equality, and empowerment. Signed by Flying Fish Records after a 1975 performance, they performed over 60 sold-out shows annually.[1][2][4][7]

Bernice Johnson Reagon retired after the group's 30th anniversary in 2003, but the ensemble continued with founding members Louise Robinson and Carol Lynn Maillard, adding singers like Nitanju Bolade Casel and Aisha Kahlil. Sign language interpreter Shirley Childress Johnson Saxton performed with them from 1980 until her death in 2017. Their legacy endures as musical missionaries of peace, solidarity, and spirituality, with recent works like the 2012 tribute album to Abbey Lincoln, Odetta, Miriam Makeba, and Nina Simone.[1][4]

## Fun Facts
- The group name comes from Psalm 81:16, describing a land so rich that honey flows from cracked rocks; the first four singers felt their voices embodied this power instantly.[1][2]
- Originally planned as a 10-13 member mixed-gender group, life circumstances reduced it to four women who decided 'This is it!' after singing five songs together.[1]
- They have had 25 vocalists over five decades, with a unique structure of five singers plus a sign-language interpreter.[1]
- In 2012, they released a tribute album at Jazz at Lincoln Center honoring activists Abbey Lincoln, Odetta, Miriam Makeba, and Nina Simone, backed by a jazz trio called the 'Honey Men'.[4]
