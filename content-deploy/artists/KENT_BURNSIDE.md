## Biography
Kent Burnside, born in 1971 in Memphis, Tennessee, is the eldest grandson of the legendary Hill Country bluesman R.L. Burnside. Raised in Holly Springs, Mississippi, Kent grew up immersed in the North Mississippi Hill Country blues tradition, working the fields and witnessing his grandfather's house parties where music brought together people from all backgrounds. His earliest musical experiences included selling sandwiches to crowds at the family farm and receiving his first guitar lesson from R.L. at age nine, who taught him the importance of finding his own rhythm and voice in the blues.

Kent's professional career began with guitarist and vocalist Jimbo Mathus for Fat Possum Records, and his big break came in the early 2000s when he toured with Buddy Guy, helping to shape his signature style: dark, hypnotic, soulful, and danceable. Over the past two decades, Kent has fronted his own bands, performing at major blues festivals and clubs worldwide, including collaborations with his uncle Garry Burnside and drummer Jake Best. His music blends Mississippi Hill Country, Delta, Chicago Blues, and blues-rock, honoring tradition while forging a contemporary sound. His recent album, 'Hill Country Blood,' produced by Grammy winner Boo Mitchell, features original compositions and covers of blues classics, further cementing his role as a torchbearer for the genre.

Kent Burnside's legacy lies in his ability to bridge generations, keeping the Hill Country blues alive while infusing it with modern energy. His performances are renowned for their raw power and ability to engage audiences, ensuring that the spirit of Mississippi blues continues to resonate with new listeners around the world.
