## Biography
Sir George Ivan 'Van' Morrison, born August 31, 1945, in Belfast, Northern Ireland, is a highly influential singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist whose career has spanned over seven decades. Exposed to music early through his father's extensive record collection, Morrison began performing as a teenager in the late 1950s, playing guitar, harmonica, keyboards, and saxophone in various Irish showbands. He rose to prominence in the mid-1960s as the frontman of the Belfast R&B band Them, penning the garage rock classic 'Gloria' and achieving chart success with songs like 'Here Comes the Night' and 'Baby, Please Don't Go.'[1][2][3][5]

Morrison launched his solo career in 1967 with the hit single 'Brown Eyed Girl,' produced by Bert Berns, which became his signature song and a staple of classic rock radio. He quickly distinguished himself with albums such as 'Astral Weeks' (1968), which fused Celtic folk, jazz, and R&B, and 'Moondance' (1970), which solidified his reputation as a masterful songwriter and performer. Throughout his career, Morrison has explored a wide range of genres, including rock, jazz, blues, soul, and Celtic music, and is known for his poetic lyrics and improvisational vocal style.[1][3][4][5]

With more than 40 albums reaching the UK Top 40 and 18 albums charting in the US, Morrison's influence is profound and enduring. He is a two-time Grammy winner, a Brit Award recipient, and has been inducted into both the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame. Knighted in 2016 for his services to music and tourism in Northern Ireland, Morrison remains an active and respected figure in music, continuing to release new material and perform internationally.[1][2][7][8]
