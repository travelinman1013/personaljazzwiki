## Biography
Joe Henderson (April 24, 1937 – June 30, 2001) was an influential American jazz tenor saxophonist whose career spanned over four decades. Born in Lima, Ohio, Henderson grew up in a large family and began his musical journey on drums before switching to tenor saxophone at age 13. He studied at Kentucky State College and Wayne State University in Detroit, where he became deeply involved in the local jazz scene, arranging for bands and playing with future jazz luminaries. After a stint in the Army (1960–1962), where he played in the Army band, Henderson moved to New York City and quickly established himself as a leading voice in jazz.

Henderson's debut as a leader, 'Page One' (1963), was a landmark Blue Note release and set the stage for a prolific recording career both as a leader and sideman. He became known for his technical mastery, unique tone, and versatility, moving fluidly between hard bop, bebop, free jazz, and fusion. Henderson collaborated with major figures like Horace Silver, Kenny Dorham, Herbie Hancock, and Lee Morgan, contributing to classic albums such as Silver’s 'Song for My Father' and Morgan’s 'The Sidewinder.' In the 1970s and 1980s, he recorded extensively for Milestone and later experienced a resurgence in the 1990s with acclaimed Verve albums that reinterpreted the works of Billy Strayhorn, Miles Davis, and Antonio Carlos Jobim.

Henderson’s legacy is marked by his innovative improvisational style, compositional skill, and lasting influence on generations of saxophonists. His sound, shaped by the influences of Sonny Rollins and John Coltrane, was both aggressive and lyrical, and he was celebrated for his ability to blend tradition with modernity. Even after suffering a stroke in 1998, his recordings and arrangements continued to inspire jazz musicians worldwide.
