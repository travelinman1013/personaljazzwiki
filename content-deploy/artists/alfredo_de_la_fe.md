## Biography
Alfredo De La Fé, born on February 6, 1954 in Havana, Cuba, is a pioneering violinist renowned for transforming the violin into a central instrument in salsa and Latin jazz. A child prodigy, he began studying violin at the Amadeo Roldan Conservatory in Havana at age six and, by eight, had earned a scholarship to the Warsaw Conservatory in Poland. His early classical training included performances with the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra at Carnegie Hall, and further studies at the Juilliard School of Music in New York[1][2][3].

De La Fé's professional career began at age twelve when he shifted from classical music to salsa, joining the orchestra of charanga legend Jose Fajardo. He quickly became the first solo violinist to perform with a salsa orchestra, breaking new ground for the instrument in Latin music. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, he collaborated with leading figures such as Eddie Palmieri, Tito Puente, Celia Cruz, Santana, and the Fania All Stars, and released his own acclaimed albums, including the Grammy-nominated 'Alfredo' (1979). His innovative style blends Cuban, jazz, classical, rock, Caribbean, funk, and pop influences, making him a versatile and influential figure in tropical music[1][2][3].

After relocating to Colombia in 1983, De La Fé further expanded his reach, recording several albums and helping to popularize salsa and vallenato in South America. He has appeared on more than a hundred albums, toured the world over thirty times, and continues to perform and record, maintaining his legacy as a virtuoso and ambassador of Latin violin[1][2][3].
