## Biography
Donny Edward Hathaway (October 1, 1945 – January 13, 1979) was an American soul singer, songwriter, pianist, arranger, and producer celebrated for his profound influence on soul, R&B, and jazz. Born in Chicago and raised in St. Louis by his grandmother, a professional gospel singer, Hathaway began performing in church at age three and was known as a piano prodigy by his teens. He attended Howard University on a fine arts scholarship, where his musical skills flourished and he formed key relationships that would shape his career.

Hathaway's professional journey began as a session musician and arranger at Curtis Mayfield's Curtom Records in Chicago, where he worked with artists such as Aretha Franklin and The Impressions. His solo career took off with the release of 'The Ghetto, Pt. 1' in 1969, followed by acclaimed albums like 'Everything Is Everything' and 'Donny Hathaway Live.' Hathaway is perhaps best known for his collaborations with Roberta Flack, including the Grammy-winning duet 'Where Is the Love' and the classic 'The Closer I Get to You.' His music blended gospel, soul, jazz, and blues, marked by rich arrangements and deeply emotive vocals.

Despite his artistic achievements, Hathaway struggled with mental health issues, specifically paranoid schizophrenia, which affected his personal and professional life. He died tragically in 1979 at the age of 33. Hathaway's legacy endures through his recordings, his influence on generations of artists, and posthumous honors such as the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.
