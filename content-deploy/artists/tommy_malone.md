## Biography
Tommy Malone is an acclaimed American singer, songwriter, and guitarist best known as the frontman of the legendary Americana band The Subdudes. Born and raised in Louisiana, Malone's musical journey began in the 1970s with formative bands such as Dustwoofie, The Cartoons, and the Continental Drifters, laying the groundwork for his distinctive blend of roots rock, Americana, and soulful storytelling. As the heart and center of The Subdudes, Malone helped define the band's sound with his emotive vocals, lyrical depth, and versatile guitar work, earning critical acclaim and a devoted fanbase over three decades. After The Subdudes disbanded in 1997, Malone continued to record and perform as a solo artist, releasing albums like 'Soul Heavy' (2001), 'Natural Born Days' (2013), and 'Poor Boy' (2014), often collaborating with renowned producers and songwriters. He also formed The Batture Boys with multi-instrumentalist Ray Ganucheau, releasing the album 'Muddy Waters' in 2016, which poignantly addressed the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and the Deepwater Horizon disaster. Malone's legacy is marked by his ability to craft vivid musical narratives and his enduring presence in the Americana and roots rock scenes, both as a solo artist and as a collaborator with some of the genre's most respected figures.
