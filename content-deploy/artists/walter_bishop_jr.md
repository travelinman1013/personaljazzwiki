## Biography
Walter Bishop Jr. (October 4, 1927 – January 24, 1998) was an American jazz pianist born and raised in lower Harlem, New York, whose father Walter Bishop Sr. was a renowned songwriter and colleague of Fats Waller. Growing up in Harlem's Sugar Hill neighborhood during the 1930s and 1940s, Bishop was surrounded by musical talent, developing friendships with future jazz legends including pianist Kenny Drew, saxophonist Sonny Rollins, and drummer Art Taylor. After dropping out of high school, he served two years in the Army Air Corps during World War II, where he encountered touring bebop musicians near St. Louis. Upon returning to Manhattan in 1947, Bishop quickly established himself as a bebop virtuoso, becoming a regular at the legendary Minton's Playhouse jam sessions alongside Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, and Thelonious Monk.

Bishop's professional career flourished throughout the bebop and hard bop eras, establishing him as a valuable utility pianist on numerous modern jazz sessions. His most significant association was with Charlie Parker, whom he joined in 1951 and recorded with until Parker's death in 1955, appearing on Parker's later Verve sessions, Bird's Quintet recordings, and Bird with Strings projects. During the 1950s, he also recorded with Miles Davis on the seminal 1951 'Dig' session and returned to the studio with Miles and Sonny Rollins in 1953 for a date that produced 'Serpent's Tooth.' Despite his musical brilliance, Bishop struggled with drug addiction during this period, resulting in imprisonment and the revocation of his New York City Cabaret Card. By the late 1950s, he had become a Muslim and adopted the name Ibrahim ibn Ismail, though he did not use it publicly. He formed his own trio in 1960 with bassist Jimmy Garrison and drummer G.T. Hogan, recording his debut as a leader with 1961's 'Speak Low' on the Jazztime label.

In the late 1960s, Bishop relocated to Los Angeles, where he performed with Supersax and trumpeter Blue Mitchell while studying with composer Lyle Spud Murphy. He returned to New York in 1974 to study at Juilliard with Hall Overton, subsequently formulating his own harmonic theory documented in 'A Study in Fourths,' a neglected but insightful book on jazz improvisation based on cycles of fourths and fifths. Beginning in the early 1980s, he taught jazz theory at the University of Hartford, while also discovering a talent for poetry and incorporating witty, insightful poems into his performances. In 1983, he performed a solo concert at Carnegie Hall. Bishop continued recording and performing actively into the 1990s, regularly touring Europe and Japan and appearing at the Charlie Parker Jazz Festival on New York City's Lower East Side. He died of a heart attack on January 24, 1998, at age 70 at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Manhattan.
