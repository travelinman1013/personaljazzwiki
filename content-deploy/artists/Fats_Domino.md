## Biography
Antoine 'Fats' Domino Jr. was born on February 26, 1928, in New Orleans, Louisiana, into a French Creole family steeped in music. The youngest of eight children, Domino grew up speaking Creole French and was introduced to music at an early age by his brother-in-law, Harrison Verrett, who taught him piano. By age 10, Domino was already performing publicly, and his prodigious talent quickly made him a fixture in the vibrant New Orleans club scene[3][5][7].

Domino's career took off in the late 1940s when he was discovered by bandleader Billy Diamond, who gave him the nickname 'Fats.' In 1949, Domino began a pivotal collaboration with Dave Bartholomew, resulting in the release of 'The Fat Man,' often cited as one of the first rock and roll records. Throughout the 1950s and early 1960s, Domino became one of rock and roll's most influential pioneers, known for his rolling piano style, smooth vocals, and a string of hits including 'Ain't That a Shame' and 'Blueberry Hill.' His approachable, rhythmic sound bridged R&B, boogie-woogie, and early rock, helping to break down racial barriers in American music[1][3][5][6].

Though his popularity waned after the early 1960s, Domino continued to record and tour for decades, remaining a beloved figure in his hometown and beyond. He was among the first inductees into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and is credited with influencing generations of musicians across genres. Domino's legacy endures as a foundational architect of rock and roll, celebrated for his joyful performances and his role in shaping the sound of modern popular music[3][5][7].
