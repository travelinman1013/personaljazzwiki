## Biography
Kevin Roosevelt Moore, known professionally as Keb' Mo', was born on October 3, 1951, in Compton, South Los Angeles, to parents originally from the deep South. He began his musical journey at age eleven, playing steel drums with the Young Calitino Steel Drum band, a popular local calypso group in South Los Angeles that performed at hotel gigs and private parties until he was nineteen. His professional breakthrough came at age twenty-one when he was hired by Jefferson Airplane violinist Papa John Creach, with whom he would work for several years and co-write the instrumental "Git Fiddler" for Jefferson Starship's 1975 album "Red Octopus," which reached number one on the Billboard 200 chart. For approximately twenty years, Keb' Mo' worked primarily behind the scenes as a respected guitarist, songwriter, and arranger, playing with blues legends such as Albert Collins and Big Joe Turner, while also recording a one-off album in 1980 under his birth name, Kevin Moore.

Keb' Mo' emerged into the spotlight in 1994 with his self-titled debut album under his now-iconic stage name, which was given to him by drummer Quentin Dennard. This album won the W.C. Handy Award for Best Country and Acoustic Blues Album in 1995, followed by his 1996 album "Just Like You" featuring special guests Bonnie Raitt and Jackson Browne, which earned him his first Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Blues Album. Throughout the late 1990s and 2000s, he maintained a prolific recording career, releasing albums including "Slow Down" (1998), "Suitcase" (2006), "Live and Mo'" (2009), and "The Reflection" (2011). A career highlight occurred in 2017 when he collaborated with his guitar idol Taj Mahal on the album "TajMo," which won his fourth Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Blues Album.

Keb' Mo' has cultivated a reputation as a modern master of American roots music, known for his genre-bending approach that connects traditional Delta blues with contemporary influences including folk, rock, jazz, pop, and country. With five Grammy Awards, fourteen Blues Foundation Awards, and a groundbreaking career spanning nearly fifty years, he has become a bridge between past and present in American blues music. Currently residing in Nashville, Tennessee, he continues to be recognized for his evocative playing and singing, and has demonstrated his commitment to charitable causes by donating 5% of his royalties from the "BLUESAmericana" album to charity.
