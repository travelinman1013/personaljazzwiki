## Quick Info

- **Origin**: Dallas, Texas, United States

## Biography
The Red Garland Quintet was led by William McKinley 'Red' Garland Jr., born May 13, 1923, in Dallas, Texas. Garland began his musical journey on clarinet and alto saxophone before switching to piano during his service in the United States Army in World War II. He received informal piano lessons from fellow servicemen and, after his discharge, joined bands led by Buster Smith and Hot Lips Page, which brought him to New York City, where he immersed himself in the vibrant jazz scene.[1][3][4]

Garland's career ascended rapidly in the 1950s, most notably as the pianist for Miles Davis's First Great Quintet from 1955 to 1958. His distinctive block chord style and sophisticated voicings became a hallmark of the group's sound, influencing the direction of modern jazz piano. Garland also led his own trio and quintet, recording prolifically for Prestige Records and collaborating with jazz luminaries such as John Coltrane, Donald Byrd, and Jimmy Heath. Despite a decline in jazz's popularity in the 1960s, Garland continued to record and perform, returning to Dallas for family reasons but later resuming his career in the 1970s.[2][3][4]

Garland's legacy is defined by his elegant, blues-inflected approach to hard bop and bebop, and his role in shaping the sound of postwar jazz. He helped popularize the block chord technique, and his recordings remain influential among jazz pianists and aficionados. Garland passed away on April 23, 1984, in Dallas, leaving behind a rich catalog and enduring impact on jazz piano.[1][3][4]

## Fun Facts

- He abruptly left the New York jazz scene in 1965 to care for his mother in Dallas, returning to recording only in the 1970s.[2][3]
- Garland's signature block chord style became a defining sound in jazz piano and is still widely studied today.[3][4]
