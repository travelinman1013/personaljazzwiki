## Biography
John Mooney, born April 3, 1955, in East Orange, New Jersey, and raised in Rochester, New York, is a renowned American blues guitarist and singer celebrated for his distinctive fusion of Delta blues and the vibrant rhythms of New Orleans. Leaving home at age 15, Mooney’s musical path was profoundly shaped at 16 when he befriended and learned directly from the legendary Delta bluesman Son House, whose rhythmic slide guitar and powerful vocal style became foundational to Mooney’s own approach.

In 1976, Mooney relocated to New Orleans, where he immersed himself in the city’s dynamic R&B and blues scene, collaborating with influential musicians such as Earl King, The Meters, Snooks Eaglin, and especially Professor Longhair, whose piano-driven grooves left a lasting mark on Mooney’s sound. He released his debut album, 'Comin’ Your Way,' in 1979 and soon formed his band, Bluesiana, with whom he has toured internationally. Mooney’s music is characterized by his fiery slide guitar, blending the raw energy of Delta blues with the syncopated, funky second-line rhythms of New Orleans, earning him accolades as a 'true New Orleans Blues Legend.'

Over a career spanning more than four decades, Mooney has released numerous albums on labels such as Blind Pig, House of Blues, and Ruf, and his 2006 album 'Big Ol’ Fiya' was nominated for a Blues Music Award. His innovative style and dedication to traditional blues have secured his place as one of the foremost contemporary interpreters of the genre, bridging the gap between its rural roots and urban evolution.
