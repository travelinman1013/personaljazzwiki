## Biography
The Nat King Cole Trio was formed in 1937 in Los Angeles by pianist Nat King Cole, guitarist Oscar Moore, and bassist Wesley Prince. The group quickly distinguished itself with a unique sound that blended jazz, swing, and vocal harmonies, all without the use of a drummer. Their innovative approach to instrumentation—often making the piano and guitar sound like a single instrument—earned them acclaim in jazz circles and helped shape the sound of small-group jazz combos. The trio specialized in both instrumental tracks and vocal performances, with Cole’s smooth baritone voice becoming a defining feature. Their first major hit, 'Straighten Up and Fly Right' (1943), was followed by a string of successes including 'The Christmas Song,' 'Route 66,' and '(I Love You) For Sentimental Reasons.' The group’s popularity led to appearances on radio, television, and in films, and they became one of the most influential jazz trios of the era.

As the 1940s progressed, the trio’s sound evolved, with Cole increasingly focusing on vocals and the group recording with orchestral arrangements. By the early 1950s, Cole’s solo career began to overshadow the trio, and the group disbanded in 1951. The Nat King Cole Trio’s legacy endures as a pioneering force in vocal jazz and small-group jazz, influencing generations of musicians and setting a standard for musical sophistication and innovation.
