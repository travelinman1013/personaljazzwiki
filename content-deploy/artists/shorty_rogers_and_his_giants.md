## Biography
Shorty Rogers and His Giants was the flagship ensemble led by Milton 'Shorty' Rogers, a pioneering trumpeter, composer, and arranger born in Great Barrington, Massachusetts, in 1924. Rogers began his musical journey in New York, attending the High School of Music and Art and playing professionally by age 16. After serving in World War II, he became a prominent figure in the bands of Woody Herman and Stan Kenton, where his skills as an arranger flourished.

In the early 1950s, Rogers emerged as a central architect of the 'West Coast jazz' or 'cool jazz' movement. He formed Shorty Rogers and His Giants in Los Angeles, assembling a roster of top musicians—many from his Kenton days—including Art Pepper, Shelley Manne, Jimmy Giuffre, and Hampton Hawes. The group became known for its innovative arrangements, sophisticated harmonies, and a lighter, more textured sound that contrasted with the intensity of bebop. Albums like 'Cool and Crazy' (1953) and 'Shorty Rogers Courts the Count' (1954) showcased Rogers' inventive use of brass and reeds, and his ability to blend swing-era sensibilities with modern jazz forms.

Rogers' legacy is deeply tied to his role as a composer and arranger who helped define the sound of West Coast jazz. His work influenced both contemporaries and future generations, and his Giants ensemble remains a touchstone for the genre's development. Rogers continued to compose, arrange, and perform until his death in 1994, leaving a lasting imprint on jazz history.
