## Biography
Morphine was an American alternative rock band formed in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1989 by Mark Sandman, Dana Colley, and Jerome Deupree. Sandman, who grew up in Cambridge, was a former cab driver and member of Treat Her Right, and brought a unique vision to the group, inventing a two-string slide bass and combining it with Colley's baritone saxophone and Deupree's drums to create a distinctive, low-end-heavy sound[3][4]. Their debut album, 'Good,' was released in 1991 on Accurate/Distortion, and reissued by Rykodisc in 1992, quickly earning them a cult following for their minimalist yet innovative approach to rock, jazz, and blues[3][4][5].

Morphine's career was marked by relentless touring and a refusal to conform to commercial pressures, turning down lucrative offers and focusing on artistic integrity. Their music appeared in several films, including 'Get Shorty' and 'Beautiful Girls,' and their albums such as 'Cure for Pain' and 'Yes' received critical acclaim for their dark, moody atmospheres and Sandman's enigmatic songwriting[3][5]. Tragically, the band came to an abrupt end in 1999 when Sandman died of a heart attack onstage in Italy, but the remaining members continued his legacy through projects like Vapors of Morphine[1][2][7].

Morphine's musical style blended elements of rock, jazz, and blues, characterized by Sandman's deep vocals, unconventional bass, and Colley's saxophone melodies. Their legacy endures as pioneers of 'low rock,' influencing countless musicians with their innovative instrumentation and emotionally resonant songwriting, and they remain celebrated for their originality and impact on the alternative music scene[3][5][7].

## Fun Facts
- Mark Sandman invented the two-string slide bass, inspired by a 45 rpm record featuring a 'unitar,' a single-string instrument played with a slide[3].
- Sandman survived being stabbed while working as a cab driver in Boston before his music career[3].
- Morphine's music appeared in several films, but the band only had control over commercial use, not film placements, which were decided by their label[3].
- The band's refusal to conform to commercial pressures led them to turn down high-profile touring offers and advertising deals, maintaining their artistic integrity[3].
