## Biography
Kimberly Brewer, Byron Miller, Herman Jackson, and Stevie Wonder form a collaborative group in the smooth jazz and jazz funk genres, known for their joint work on tracks blending soulful vocals, intricate bass lines, and melodic keyboards. Kimberly Brewer, an American singer and background vocalist, is best recognized for her longtime collaboration with Stevie Wonder, contributing her smooth, emotive style to projects that highlight her role in backing and lead vocals.[1][3][4] Byron Miller, a bassist prominent in the 1970s funk scene, brings his 'psycho bass' technique—characterized by funky lead electric bass lines that emerged as an infectious style during that era—adding depth and groove to their shared recordings.[6]

Their career development centers around interconnected smooth jazz releases, with Spotify data indicating a popularity score of 31 in genres like smooth jazz and jazz funk. Herman Jackson contributes keyboard and production elements, as seen in collaborations such as 'Every Day Feels Like Christmas' featuring Stevie Wonder, while tracks like 'The B' and 'Hearts Horizing' showcase the full quartet's synergy, emphasizing Wonder's influential songwriting and musicianship.[2][5][6] This group's musical style fuses Wonder's soulful innovation with Brewer's vocal warmth, Miller's funky bass, and Jackson's melodic support, creating accessible yet sophisticated jazz funk.

No extensive early life details are available from sources, focusing instead on professional ties.[1][2]
