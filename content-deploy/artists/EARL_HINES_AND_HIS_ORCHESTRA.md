## Biography
Earl Hines, born in Duquesne, Pennsylvania in 1903, was a pioneering jazz pianist and bandleader whose innovative approach helped shape the sound of big band, swing, and early bebop. Initially trained on trumpet by his father, Hines switched to piano as a child, developing a distinctive style characterized by trumpet-like right-hand lines and a rhythmically adventurous left hand. After moving to Chicago in the early 1920s, he became a central figure in the city’s vibrant jazz scene, collaborating with Louis Armstrong and recording landmark sessions such as 'West End Blues' and 'Weather Bird.'

In 1928, Hines formed his own big band, Earl Hines and His Orchestra, which became the resident ensemble at Chicago’s Grand Terrace Ballroom for over a decade. His orchestra was renowned for its musicianship and for launching the careers of future jazz stars, including Billy Eckstine, Sarah Vaughan, Dizzy Gillespie, and Charlie Parker. Hines’s willingness to embrace new styles kept his music relevant, and his band was among the first to experiment with bebop, though the 1943-44 recording ban prevented this era from being documented. After disbanding his orchestra in 1948, Hines toured with Louis Armstrong’s All-Stars and later led small groups, remaining an influential performer until his death in 1983.

Hines’s legacy is profound: his rhythmic innovations and melodic inventiveness influenced generations of jazz pianists, and his leadership nurtured some of the most important voices in jazz history. He is remembered as a bridge between early jazz, swing, and modern jazz, and as a key architect of the big band sound.

## Fun Facts
- Earl Hines was nicknamed 'Fatha' by a radio announcer, a moniker that stuck for the rest of his career.
- His orchestra was the first major African-American big band to tour the segregated South in 1931.
- In 1943, Hines hired an all-female orchestra for a brief period when many male musicians were drafted during World War II.
- Despite leading a band that included Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie, no recordings exist of Hines’s legendary bebop orchestra due to the 1943–44 musicians’ strike.
