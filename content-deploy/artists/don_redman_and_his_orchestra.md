## Biography
Don Redman (July 29, 1900 – November 30, 1964), known as 'the little giant of jazz,' was a pioneering American jazz musician, arranger, bandleader, and composer whose innovations laid the foundation for the big band era. Born in Piedmont, West Virginia, Redman was a child prodigy who mastered most orchestral instruments by his early teens. He graduated from Storer College with a music degree at age 20 and continued his studies at conservatories in Boston and Detroit. Redman began his professional career with Billy Paige’s Broadway Syncopators before joining Fletcher Henderson's orchestra in New York, where he became chief arranger and was instrumental in shaping the band's sound.

Redman’s arrangements for Henderson, which featured call-and-response between brass and reeds and inventive use of the clarinet trio, were widely imitated and helped define the swing style. After leaving Henderson in 1927, Redman directed McKinney’s Cotton Pickers, producing influential recordings and original compositions. In 1931, he formed Don Redman and his Orchestra, securing a residency at Connie’s Inn in Harlem and recording for Brunswick, ARC, and Bluebird. His band was noted for sophisticated arrangements and featured top musicians of the era. Redman continued to compose and arrange for leading bands throughout the 1930s and 1940s, freelancing for Count Basie, Cab Calloway, and Jimmy Dorsey, and in 1946 led the first American jazz band to tour postwar Europe. Though he never achieved widespread fame, Redman’s contributions as an arranger and bandleader were crucial to the development of jazz and swing music.
