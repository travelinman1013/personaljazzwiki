## Biography
Vince Giordano, born March 11, 1952, in New York, discovered jazz at age five through his grandmother's collection of 1920s and 1930s phonograph records, including Louis Armstrong and King Oliver, sparking a lifelong passion. He began with violin, switched to tuba in seventh grade, added string bass and bass saxophone, joined the musicians' union at 14, and played with Dixieland bands on Long Island. After high school, he served in the 22-piece Navy Show Band, toured Europe with Eddy Davis, and performed in New York with Tony Parenti and Max Kaminsky.[1][2][5]

In 1976, Giordano formed the Nighthawks (originally New Orleans Nighthawks), a New York-based orchestra dedicated to authentic 1920s-1930s hot jazz, swing, and popular music from artists like Jelly Roll Morton, Louis Armstrong, and Duke Ellington. The band gained residency at Red Blazer Too in 1977, featuring veterans from Glenn Miller, Benny Goodman, and Casa Loma orchestras, and later at the Carlyle Hotel. Giordano studied with period survivors like Bill Challis, Chauncey Morehouse, and Joe Tarto, amassing over 60,000 scores as a big-band historian. His multi-instrumental skills on bass saxophone, string bass, tuba, and vocals led to extensive film and TV work, including Woody Allen films like Zelig and The Purple Rose of Cairo via Dick Hyman, The Cotton Club, The Aviator, and HBO's Boardwalk Empire, earning a 2012 Grammy nomination.[1][2][3][4]

Giordano's commitment to authenticity has preserved Jazz Age music, performing at Jazz at Lincoln Center, Newport Jazz Festival, and worldwide ballet companies, while appearing in films and soundtracks that introduce the era to new audiences. A Grammy winner and New York institution, he continues leading the Nighthawks, blending raw energy with sophisticated syncopation.[1][2][5]
