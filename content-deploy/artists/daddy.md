## Biography
Ramón Luis Ayala Rodríguez, professionally known as Daddy Yankee, was born on February 3, 1977, in Río Piedras, San Juan, Puerto Rico.[1][2] In his youth, he aspired to become a professional baseball player, but a life-altering incident changed his trajectory. While taking a break from a studio recording session, he was shot in the leg by someone who mistook him for a friend. The bullet was never removed, and this tragedy ultimately redirected his focus toward music, allowing him to pursue what would become a legendary career in reggaeton.[1][2] He began rapping and singing at age 13, during the early stages of the underground rap movement in Puerto Rico.[5]

Daddy Yankee emerged as a pioneer of reggaeton during the 1990s, first appearing on DJ Playero's Playero 34 mixtape in 1992 with the song "So' Persigueme, No Te Detengas."[4][6] His debut solo album, No Mercy, was released in 1995.[1][2] Throughout the 1990s, he performed on several of DJ Playero's underground mixtapes, which featured some of the first reggaeton tracks ever made.[4] In the late 1990s, at just 21 years old, he launched his own label, El Cartel Records.[5] He subsequently collaborated with Nicky Jam and released albums including El Cartel and El Cartel II.[1]

Daddy Yankee achieved global mainstream success with his 2004 album Barrio Fino, which debuted at the top of the Latin music charts and remained there for over a year, propelled by hit singles that captured international attention.[3] Dubbed the "King of Reggaeton," he is widely recognized as one of the genre's most influential figures and is frequently cited as an inspiration by other Hispanic urban performers.[6] He has won multiple Latin Grammy Awards and continues to be a defining force in reggaeton and Latin music.[1][8]
