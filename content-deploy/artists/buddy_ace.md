## Biography
Buddy Ace, born Jimmy Lee Land on November 11, 1936, in Jasper, Texas, was a celebrated American blues and soul singer known as 'The Silver Fox of the Blues.' Raised in Baytown near Houston, Ace demonstrated musical talent from an early age, performing with his family and later joining a gospel quartet in high school alongside future soul star Joe Tex. His early musical influences included Ivory Joe Hunter and Big Joe Turner, which helped shape his distinctive blend of soul, blues, and R&B.[1][2][3]

Ace's professional career began in earnest in 1955 when he signed with Duke Records, adopting the stage name 'Buddy Ace' in a move orchestrated by label owner Don Robey to capitalize on the legacy of the late Johnny Ace. Throughout the late 1950s and 1960s, Ace released a string of singles, with his biggest hits being 'Nothing in the World Can Hurt Me (Except You)' and 'Hold On (To This Old Fool),' both charting on Billboard's R&B charts. He toured with notable acts such as Bobby 'Blue' Bland and Junior Parker, further cementing his reputation in the blues circuit. In the 1970s, Ace relocated to California, performing regularly in clubs across Los Angeles, Oakland, and Sacramento. His hair turned white in his forties, earning him the enduring nickname 'The Silver Fox.'[1][2][3]

Despite a decline in commercial success after the 1960s, Ace remained a respected figure in the soul blues scene, recording albums like 'Don't Hurt No More' and 'Silver Fox' in the 1990s. He continued performing until his death from a heart attack on December 26, 1994, while onstage in Waco, Texas. Buddy Ace's legacy endures through his emotive vocal style and his contributions to the Texas blues and soul tradition.[1][2][3]

## Fun Facts
- Buddy Ace was not related to Johnny Ace, despite sharing a stage name and label history; the connection was a marketing decision by Duke Records.[4]
