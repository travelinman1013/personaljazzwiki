## Biography
Isham Jones was born on January 31, 1894, in Coalton, Ohio, and grew up in Saginaw, Michigan, where he was immersed in music from an early age. He moved to Chicago in his early twenties and quickly established himself as a bandleader, fronting his own dance orchestra by 1918. His band became one of the most popular dance ensembles of the 1920s and early 1930s, known for its polished arrangements and sophisticated sound. Jones was not only a skilled saxophonist but also a prolific composer, penning enduring standards such as 'It Had To Be You,' 'I'll See You In My Dreams,' and 'Wabash Blues.' His orchestra was a fixture at major venues like the Hotel Sherman’s College Inn and the Rainbo Gardens, and they toured extensively in the United States and England, earning acclaim as a leading voice of the Jazz Age and the Roaring Twenties.

Jones’s musical style blended elements of ragtime, early jazz, and swing, with arrangements that were both melodic and rhythmically inventive. He was among the first to record jazz on the tenor saxophone and helped bridge the gap between traditional dance music and the emerging swing era. After a period of focusing on songwriting in the late 1920s, Jones returned to leading orchestras in the 1930s, recording for labels such as Victor and Decca. His 1930s band featured arrangements by Jones and Gordon Jenkins and included a young Woody Herman, whose own career was launched from Jones’s ensemble. Jones retired from leading bands in 1936 but briefly returned in 1937–38 before stepping away from the spotlight. His legacy endures through his timeless compositions and his role in shaping the sound of American popular music.
