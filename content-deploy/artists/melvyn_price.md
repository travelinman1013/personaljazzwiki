## Biography
Melvyn Price was born in Pontiac, Michigan, and emerged as a talented trombonist and conga player during the vibrant jazz and funk scenes of the late 1960s and early 1970s. Deeply affected by the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. and the ensuing political turmoil in the United States, Price made the pivotal decision to leave his homeland and settle in Sweden. There, he quickly integrated into the Scandinavian jazz community, becoming a familiar figure among local musicians and audiences alike.

In Sweden, Price established his own record label, Meldor, and released two early 1970s albums—'Jazzbalettrytmer' and 'Rytmer II'—which blended jazz and Latin rhythms, originally intended for dance classes. His 1974 album 'Rhythm and Blues' featured prominent Swedish jazz musicians such as drummer Fredrik Norén and bassist Björn Alke, and showcased a style rooted in late 1960s and early 1970s jazz with subtle influences of Afro-funk. Though his work remained relatively obscure for decades, the reissue of 'Rhythm and Blues' in 2008 sparked renewed interest among collectors and jazz enthusiasts, cementing his legacy as a unique contributor to the international jazz-funk scene.
