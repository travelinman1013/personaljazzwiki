## Biography
James Jay Barnes, born November 30, 1943, in Detroit, Michigan, was an American R&B singer and songwriter who became one of the most beloved artists on the U.K. northern soul scene despite achieving limited commercial success in his native United States.[1][3] Growing up in Detroit's fertile music landscape, Barnes was immersed in gospel music from an early age, performing with his family on the gospel circuit alongside legendary artists like Sister Rosetta Tharpe and the Fairfield Four. At age 15, he joined the gospel quartet the Hurricane Travelers, which led to his first professional recording experience. His early career was marked by work with some of Motown's finest studio musicians, including members of the legendary Funk Brothers, on his 1960 debut single "Won't You Let Me Know."[2]

Throughout the 1960s, Barnes recorded for multiple labels including Mickays, Scepter, Ric-Tic, and Revilot, establishing himself as both a skilled vocalist and respected songwriter.[1] While Berry Gordy of Motown chose not to release Barnes's records as a solo artist—reportedly believing his sound was too similar to Marvin Gaye—he recognized Barnes's songwriting talents and had him co-write tracks for Martha & the Vandellas ("Show Me the Way," 1967) and the Marvelettes ("Don't Make Hurting Me a Habit," 1968).[1] His recordings, particularly "Please Let Me In" (1965) and "Our Love Is in the Pocket" (1968), became foundational cornerstones of the northern soul movement in the United Kingdom, despite being largely ignored in America. After Edwin Starr encouraged him to pursue opportunities in England, Barnes obtained his first passport in 1973 and performed at a sold-out show at the 100 Club in London, eventually wearing out three passports from frequent transatlantic travel.[2]

Barnes remained active for over 50 years, continuing to record and perform into the 2000s.[3] In the 1980s, he released material for Ian Levine's Motor City label, including a cover of Frank Wilson's northern soul classic "Do I Love You (Indeed I Do)."[1] His music experienced a revival in the early 2000s through garage rock band the Dirtbombs, who covered his song "Chains of Love" on their 2001 album Ultraglide in Black.[3] Barnes passed away on December 10, 2022, shortly after his 79th birthday, leaving behind a legacy as a crucial figure in northern soul history and a testament to the enduring power of soul music across generations and continents.[3]
