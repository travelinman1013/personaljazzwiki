## Biography
King Pleasure, born Clarence Beeks on March 24, 1922, in Oakdale, Tennessee, became one of jazz's most innovative vocalists and a pioneering master of vocalese. He grew up in Cincinnati and worked outside the music industry until his late twenties, when he moved to New York City in the mid-1940s. There, he immersed himself in the bebop scene, working as a bartender while absorbing the revolutionary sounds emanating from legendary venues like Birdland, The Famous Door, and Bop City on 52nd Street. His transformative moment came in late 1951 at the Apollo Theater's amateur night, where he performed his own interpretation of "I'm In The Mood For Love" using lyrics originally crafted by Eddie Jefferson to James Moody's instrumental solo. His victory that night marked the birth of "King Pleasure" as an artist and launched his recording career.

Following his Apollo Theater triumph, King Pleasure signed with Prestige Records in February 1952, recording "Moody's Mood For Love" with accompaniment from Teacho Wiltshire on piano and vocalist Blossom Dearie. The recording became an immediate sensation, climbing into the top ten R&B national charts and establishing vocalese as a legitimate and captivating jazz style. Throughout the 1950s, he continued recording prolifically for Prestige, collaborating with jazz luminaries including John Lewis, Percy Heath, Kenny Clarke, J.J. Johnson, Kai Winding, and arranger Quincy Jones. His interpretations of jazz standards and instrumental solos demonstrated his technical mastery and creative sensitivity, earning him recognition as one of the finest practitioners of the demanding vocalese technique.

King Pleasure's legacy rests on his role in elevating vocalese from an experimental novelty to an art form worthy of serious jazz consideration. Though he worked outside the mainstream spotlight compared to some contemporaries, his influence resonated through subsequent generations of jazz vocalists who recognized the sophistication required to sing meaningful lyrics over complex instrumental improvisations. He passed away on March 21, 1982, just three days before his 60th birthday, leaving behind a catalog of recordings that remain essential documents of 1950s jazz innovation.
