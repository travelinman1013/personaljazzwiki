## Biography
Salebarbes is a Canadian band formed in 2019 by brothers Jonathan Painchaud (born September 17, 1974, in Iles de la Madeleine, Quebec) and Éloi Painchaud, both experienced musicians from the Quebec music scene. Jonathan, a former member of the group Okoumé, has released solo albums including Qu'on se lève (2007), La dernière des arcades (2010), Mon cœur collé au tien (2013), and La tête haute (2016), while Éloi, son of Alcide Painchaud—a founding member of the Madelinois band Suroît—previously collaborated with his brother on a duo album in 2002 and served as a multi-instrumentalist and producer. The band, described as a Montreal-based Acadian supergroup, blends traditional Acadian, French-Canadian, Cajun, and Louisiana influences with modern rock and folk elements, creating a hybrid style often called 'folky rock 'n' roll trad.'[1][2][3][4][5][7]

Salebarbes quickly gained prominence with their debut live album Live au Pas Perdus (2019), capturing covers of Louisiana songs performed at a Magdalen Islands venue, followed by Gin à l'eau salée (2021) and À boire deboutte (2023), the latter recorded in just six weeks at Studio B-12 in Valcourt, Quebec. Their energetic live shows, featuring high-energy performances of tracks like 'Marcher l'plancher,' 'Chat par la cheu,' and 'Gagner sa vie,' have sold out venues such as MTelus, Le Capitole de Quebec, and festivals including the Montreal International Jazz Festival and Festival International Nuits d'Afrique. The band won the Félix Award for Group of the Year at the 44th Félix Awards in 2022 and Francophone Artist of the Year at the 2025 Canadian Country Music Association Awards.[1][2][3][4][6]

Salebarbes' legacy lies in revitalizing Acadian and Cajun traditions with a contemporary twist, adding 'maple syrup flavor' to the 'gumbo' of Louisiana music, as described by Jonathan. Their jubilant, celebratory shows foster deep audience connections, positioning them as one of Quebec's most sought-after acts with upcoming collaborations like performances with the Orchestre symphonique de Montréal (OSM) and guests such as Hay Babies, Zachary Richard, and a brass section at the Festival d'été de Québec in 2025.[3][4][6][7][9]

## Fun Facts
