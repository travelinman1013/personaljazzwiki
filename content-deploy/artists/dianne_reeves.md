## Biography
Dianne Elizabeth Reeves (born October 23, 1956) is an American jazz vocalist widely regarded as one of the pre-eminent jazz singers of her generation.[1][4][6] Born in Detroit, Michigan, she was raised in Denver, Colorado by her mother and extended family after her father died when she was two.[1] Her uncle Charles Burrell, a bassist with the Denver/Colorado Symphony, introduced her to jazz and to the recordings of Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday, and Sarah Vaughan, planting the foundations of her musical identity.[1][3] Reeves began singing and playing piano as a teenager, joined her high-school big band, and was discovered at a National Association of Jazz Educators convention by trumpeter Clark Terry, who became a crucial mentor and early bandleader for her.[1][3][4]

After briefly studying classical voice and music at the University of Colorado, Reeves moved to Los Angeles in the mid-1970s, where she worked as a studio vocalist and immersed herself in Latin and fusion styles.[1][2][3][4] She recorded with artists such as Stanley Turrentine, Lenny White, and pianist Billy Childs (with whom she formed the band Night Flight and a lasting musical partnership), and performed with Caldera’s Eduardo del Barrio and her cousin, keyboardist and producer George Duke.[1][3][4] In 1981 she toured internationally with Brazilian bandleader Sergio Mendes, and from 1983 to 1986 she was the lead vocalist in Harry Belafonte’s band, experiences that deepened her engagement with Brazilian, Caribbean, and broader world-music rhythms.[1][2][3][4] Her debut album *Welcome to My Love* (1982) led to a landmark signing as the first vocalist on the reactivated Blue Note label in 1987; her self-titled album *Dianne Reeves*, featuring Herbie Hancock, Freddie Hubbard, and Tony Williams, was nominated for a Grammy and launched a series of acclaimed Blue Note releases through the 1990s, including *I Remember*, *The Grand Encounter*, *The Calling: Celebrating Sarah Vaughan*, and *A Little Moonlight*.[1][3][4]

Reeves’s musical style blends straight-ahead jazz with soul, R&B, and Latin influences, marked by remarkable vocal power, improvisational freedom, and sophisticated scat singing.[3][4][6][8] Critics have called her a logical successor to Dinah Washington and Carmen McRae, and compared her sound to singers such as Anita Baker and Patti Austin, while she has paid direct tribute to Sarah Vaughan on *The Calling*.[4] She became the first artist in any vocal category to win Grammys for Best Jazz Vocal Performance/Album for three consecutive recordings—*In the Moment – Live in Concert*, *The Calling: Celebrating Sarah Vaughan*, and *A Little Moonlight*—and added further Grammys for the soundtrack to George Clooney’s film *Good Night, and Good Luck* and for *Beautiful Life* in 2014.[2][4][5][6] Beyond her recordings, Reeves has appeared in major films, performed with ensembles such as the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra, Chicago Symphony Orchestra, and the Berlin Philharmonic, served as the first Creative Chair for Jazz for the Los Angeles Philharmonic, and in 2018 was named an NEA Jazz Master, underscoring her lasting legacy as one of modern jazz’s definitive vocal voices.[3][4][5][6]
