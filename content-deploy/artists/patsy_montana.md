## Biography
Patsy Montana, born Rubye Rose Blevins in Beaudry, Arkansas in 1908, was the first female country performer to achieve a million-selling single.  Growing up with ten brothers near Hope, Arkansas, two of whom died in a childhood fire, she developed a musical talent early on.  In 1929, she moved to California to study violin at the University of the West (UCLA), winning a talent contest that launched her radio career on the Hollywood Breakfast Club program.  Her musical journey continued with a trip to the 1933 Chicago World's Fair, where an unexpected audition led to a spot with the Prairie Ramblers on WLS-AM's National Barn Dance. This experience proved pivotal in shaping her career.

Montana's career blossomed with the Prairie Ramblers, who backed her on recordings for ARC Records, Decca, and RCA Victor.  In 1934, she reworked the song "Texas Plains" into "Montana Plains," which she further developed into her signature hit, "I Want to Be a Cowboy's Sweetheart," released in 1935. This song propelled her to unprecedented success, making her the first female country artist to sell a million records.  Her National Barn Dance tenure extended into the 1950s, during which she collaborated with notable figures like Gene Autry, Pat Buttram, Red Foley, the Girls of the Golden West, and George Gobel.  She also starred in the feature film *Colorado Sunset* alongside Smiley Burnette and Gene Autry.  It was through the National Barn Dance that she met her husband, Paul E. Rose, a stage manager for Gene Autry.  Later, she and her two daughters formed the Patsy Montana Trio.  After a semi-retirement in the late 1950s, she attempted a comeback in 1964, recording an album with Waylon Jennings on lead guitar.

Montana's musical style blended country and western influences, incorporating yodeling and guitar playing into her performances.  Her innovative approach to country music, particularly her success with "I Want to Be a Cowboy's Sweetheart," broke barriers for female artists in the genre.  Her legacy is cemented by her induction into both the National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame (1987) and the Country Music Hall of Fame (1996).  Her influence is evident in the work of later singers such as Patsy Cline, Dottie West, and more recently, Devon Dawson, the singing voice of Jessie the Yodeling Cowgirl in *Toy Story 2*.  The enduring popularity of "I Want to Be a Cowboy's Sweetheart," featured in the closing credits of John Sayles' 1996 film *Lone Star*, further underscores her lasting impact on country music.
