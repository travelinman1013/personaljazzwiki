Kahil El'Zabar, born Clifton Blackburn in Chicago on November 11, 1953, is a pioneering American jazz multi-instrumentalist, composer, bandleader, and educator. He grew up immersed in Chicago's vibrant music scene, joining the influential Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians (AACM) as a teenager and eventually serving as its chairman in 1975.
