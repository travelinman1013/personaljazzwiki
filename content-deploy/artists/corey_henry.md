## Biography
Cory Alexander Henry, born February 27, 1987 in Brooklyn, New York, is an acclaimed American jazz organist, pianist, gospel musician, and producer. A child prodigy, Henry began playing the piano and Hammond B3 organ at just two years old, and by age six, he had already performed at the legendary Apollo Theater in Harlem, making it to the finalist round. His early exposure to gospel and jazz in Brooklyn's Unity Temple Church deeply influenced his musical foundation and improvisational prowess.[2][4][5][6]

Henry's professional career accelerated when, at nineteen, he toured as the organist for jazz legend Kenny Garrett for three years, further honing his craft and expanding his audience. He joined the experimental jazz and funk ensemble Snarky Puppy in 2012, contributing to several Grammy-winning projects and establishing himself as a versatile collaborator. In 2018, Henry launched his solo career with the album 'Art of Love,' followed by the Grammy-nominated 'Something to Say' and subsequent releases like 'Operation Funk' and 'Live at the Piano.' His style blends retro soul, jazz fusion, gospel, and R&B, drawing inspiration from icons such as Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, Donny Hathaway, P-Funk, and James Brown.[1][3][4][5][6]

Henry's legacy is marked by his genre-defying approach, virtuosic technique, and ability to bridge traditional and contemporary sounds. He has collaborated with a wide array of artists, including Bruce Springsteen, Imagine Dragons, Kanye West, and Rosalía, and continues to inspire both peers and emerging musicians through his innovative performances and educational outreach.[1][3][5][6]
