## Biography
Gal Costa (Maria da Graça Costa e Silva) and Caetano Veloso represent one of Brazilian music's most significant creative partnerships. They met in 1963 when Caetano Veloso, then a philosophy student at the Federal University of Bahia, was introduced to Gal Costa by mutual friend Dedé Gadelha, initiating a friendship and mutual admiration that would shape Brazilian popular music for decades.[1][2] Both artists made their professional debut together on August 22, 1964, at the concert "Nós, por Exemplo" (We, For Example) at the Teatro Vila Velha in Salvador, alongside Gilberto Gil, Maria Bethânia, and Tom Zé.[1][4] Their first collaborative LP, "Domingo" (Sunday), released in 1967 on the Philips label, demonstrated their shared debt to bossa nova and established them as emerging forces in Brazilian music.[1][2]

The partnership reached its artistic peak during the Tropicália movement of the late 1960s and early 1970s, a revolutionary fusion of samba, bossa nova, and modern genres like rock and beat.[4][5] In 1968, both artists participated in the landmark album "Tropicália ou Panis et Circensis," with Gal Costa recording "Mamãe Coragem," "Parque Industrial," "Enquanto Seu Lobo Não Vem," and "Baby"—her first major solo hit that became a classic.[1] When Veloso and Gilberto Gil were forced into European exile due to Brazil's military dictatorship in 1970, Gal Costa became the keeper of their artistic flame, performing songs they sent to her and maintaining the movement's vitality in Brazil.[5]

Throughout their careers, Veloso and Costa continued their creative collaboration across multiple albums and projects. Notable works include the 1974 album "Cantar," directed by Veloso, and various duets including "Sorte" on the 1985 album "Bem Bom."[1] Gal Costa's extensive career spanning over seventy years produced 1,080 songs across more than 200 albums, while Caetano Veloso became one of Brazil's most influential and controversial cultural figures, winning 13 Latin Grammy Awards and 2 American Grammy Awards.[3][8] Their partnership exemplified the creative synergy of the Tropicália movement and helped establish Brazilian popular music (MPB) as a global force.
