## Biography
Tommy Dorsey, born Thomas Francis Dorsey, Jr. on November 19, 1905, in Mahanoy Plane, Pennsylvania, was a prodigious jazz trombonist, trumpeter, composer, and one of the most influential big band leaders of the swing era. Raised in a musical family, Tommy and his older brother Jimmy were taught music by their father, a self-taught musician and coal miner. The brothers began performing professionally as teenagers, forming their first band, the Wild Canaries, and soon became fixtures in the burgeoning jazz scene, playing with prominent orchestras such as those led by Jean Goldkette and Paul Whiteman[2][4][5].

Tommy Dorsey's career took off in the 1920s and early 1930s, first as a freelance musician and then as co-leader of the Dorsey Brothers Orchestra. After a split with Jimmy in 1935, Tommy formed his own orchestra, quickly establishing a reputation for his smooth, lyrical trombone style—earning him the nickname 'The Sentimental Gentleman of Swing.' His band became one of the most popular of the late 1930s and 1940s, known for both swinging jazz numbers and lush ballads. Dorsey's perfectionism and keen ear for talent led him to hire and collaborate with some of the era's greatest musicians and vocalists, including a young Frank Sinatra[1][2][3][5].

Dorsey's influence extended beyond his own recordings and performances. He was a technical innovator on the trombone, admired for his breath control and melodic phrasing. His orchestra served as a launching pad for many future stars, and his arrangements helped define the sound of American big band and swing music. Even as the big band era waned, Dorsey remained active, reuniting with his brother Jimmy in the 1950s for television appearances and continuing to perform until his death in 1956[4][5].
