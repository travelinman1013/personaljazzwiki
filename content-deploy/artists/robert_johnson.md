## Biography
Robert Leroy Johnson (May 8, 1911 – August 16, 1938) was an American blues musician and songwriter, widely regarded as one of the most influential figures in the history of blues and popular music. Born in Hazlehurst, Mississippi, Johnson spent his early years moving between plantations in the Mississippi Delta, absorbing the region’s rich musical traditions. Despite a lack of commercial success during his brief life, Johnson’s intense vocals, innovative guitar technique, and evocative songwriting set him apart from his contemporaries. His career as a traveling performer took him to street corners, juke joints, and Saturday night dances throughout the South, where he developed a reputation for both his musical prowess and his mysterious persona.[1][2][3]

Johnson’s recording career was remarkably short, spanning just two sessions in 1936 and 1937, yet he produced 29 songs that would become foundational to the blues canon. Tracks like “Cross Road Blues,” “Hellhound on My Trail,” “Love in Vain,” and “Sweet Home Chicago” are now considered classics. His music, characterized by expressive vocals and intricate guitar work, epitomized the Delta blues style and later inspired generations of musicians across genres. Johnson’s life and death became shrouded in legend, most famously the tale that he sold his soul to the devil at a crossroads in exchange for his extraordinary talent.[1][2][3][5]

Johnson died at the age of 27 near Greenwood, Mississippi, under mysterious circumstances—possibly poisoned by a jealous husband, though his death certificate cites complications of syphilis. His posthumous fame grew exponentially, and he is now celebrated as the 'King of the Delta Blues Singers.' His influence extends far beyond the blues, shaping the work of rock and roll icons and cementing his legacy as a foundational figure in American music.[1][2][3][4]
