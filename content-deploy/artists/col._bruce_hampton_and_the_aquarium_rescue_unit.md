## Biography
Col. Bruce Hampton & the Aquarium Rescue Unit was a jam band that originated in Atlanta, Georgia, emerging from weekly Monday night jam sessions hosted by Col. Bruce Hampton at the Little Five Points Pub in the late 1980s. The band's core lineup crystallized around Hampton's visionary leadership, featuring guitarist Jimmy Herring, bassist Oteil Burbridge, drummer Jeff Sipe, mandolin player Matt Mundy, and percussionist Count M'Butu. Active primarily from 1988 to 1993, the Aquarium Rescue Unit gained significant popularity in the Atlanta club scene and became one of the first bands to tour with the H.O.R.D.E. Tour, establishing themselves as influential figures in the emerging jamband community. The band's improvisational approach and technical prowess earned them a devoted following among Phish and Grateful Dead fans, as well as audiences interested in neo-jazz and blues fusion.

The Aquarium Rescue Unit's influence far exceeded their commercial success, earning comparisons to the Velvet Underground for their profound impact on the jam band genre despite modest sales figures. Their 1992 live album, recorded at the Georgia Theatre in Athens, Georgia, showcased the band's dynamic interplay and Hampton's distinctive vocal and guitar work. Though Hampton departed in 1993 due to health concerns—his blood pressure reaching critical levels from the demanding touring schedule—the remaining members continued as the Aquarium Rescue Unit with rotating vocalists and musicians. The band reunited for several performances beginning in 2004, with subsequent reunions in 2011 and 2015, demonstrating the enduring legacy and mutual respect among the original members.

Col. Bruce Hampton's broader musical career extended beyond the Aquarium Rescue Unit, encompassing his earlier work with the Hampton Grease Band and The Late Bronze Age, as well as subsequent projects including the Fiji Mariners, Planet Zambee, the Code Talkers, and Col. Bruce & the Quark Alliance. Hampton's role as a mentor and musical philosopher proved as significant as his instrumental abilities; he was known for teaching young musicians about life and music rather than merely technical proficiency, sharing metaphors and wisdom accumulated from decades in the music industry. His legacy in the jam band universe remains substantial, with his influence evident in the careers of numerous musicians who passed through his bands and absorbed his improvisational philosophy.
