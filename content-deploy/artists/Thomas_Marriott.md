Growing up in the 1980s and 1990s, he was immersed in Seattle’s vibrant jazz culture, frequently attending live performances by local masters, which deeply influenced his musical development[4]. Marriott attended Garfield High School and later studied at the University of Washington’s Jazz Studies program before launching his professional career in 1992[6].

In 2024, he was named a 'Jazz Hero' by the Jazz Journalists Association, underscoring his impact both as a musician and a community leader[1][2].
