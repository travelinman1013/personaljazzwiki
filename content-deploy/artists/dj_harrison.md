## Biography
DJ Harrison, born Devonne Andre Harris in 1988 in Petersburg, Virginia, is a highly versatile multi-instrumentalist, producer, songwriter, and recording engineer whose work bridges jazz, funk, hip-hop, soul, and R&B. Raised in Richmond, VA, in a musically rich household—his mother a music aficionado and his father a radio DJ—Harrison was immersed in a wide spectrum of sounds from an early age. He began experimenting with instruments as a child, starting with drums at age three, then moving on to piano, bass, and a variety of wind instruments during his school years. His early fascination with both the mechanics of music and the art of recording led him to pursue formal studies in jazz at Virginia Commonwealth University, where he further honed his craft and met future collaborators.[1][3][6][7]

Harrison's career is marked by both prolific solo output and deep collaborative work. As a founding member and keyboardist of the acclaimed jazz/hip-hop fusion band Butcher Brown, he helped shape a sound that draws from '60s jazz, '70s funk, and modern hip-hop. His solo albums, including 'HazyMoods,' 'Tales from the Old Dominion,' and 'Shades of Yesterday,' showcase his ability to blend live instrumentation with sample-based production, often paying homage to his musical heroes. Harrison is also the founder of Jellowstone Studios in Richmond, a creative hub for local and national artists. His production and session work have earned him two Grammy nominations, and he has contributed to projects by Jack White, Nicholas Payton, Kurt Elling, Charlie Hunter, and many others.[1][2][4][5][8]

Known for his experimental spirit and deep respect for musical tradition, DJ Harrison's legacy is one of innovation and mentorship within the contemporary jazz and beat-making communities. His influence extends through his collaborations, his stewardship of the Richmond music scene, and his genre-defying approach that continues to inspire a new generation of musicians.[1][2][3][4]
