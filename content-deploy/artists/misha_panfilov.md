## Biography
Misha Panfilov is an Estonian-born composer, multi-instrumentalist, and producer whose innovative approach has made him a central figure in the modern garage rock and jazz scenes. Born in Tallinn, Estonia, Panfilov developed a passion for music early in life, mastering a range of instruments and immersing himself in the sonic traditions of jazz, psychedelic rock, ambient, and electronic music. His career blossomed through a prolific output of solo projects and collaborative bands, including Penza Penza, Estrada Orchestra, and Center El Muusa, each exploring different facets of his eclectic musical vision[1][2][3][7].

Panfilov is celebrated for his ability to blend genres, creating a unique sound that draws from the DIY ethos of 1960s garage rock, the improvisational spirit of jazz, and the dreamy textures of ambient exotica. His work often pays homage to musical pioneers while introducing modern influences and experimental techniques, as heard in albums like 'Heli Maagi' and 'In Focus.' Now based in Funchal, Portugal, Panfilov continues to push boundaries, using analogue recording methods and collaborating with a diverse cast of musicians to craft records that are both timeless and forward-thinking[1][4][5][8].

Through his various incarnations and ensembles, Panfilov has established a legacy as a fearless innovator and visionary, earning recognition for his genre-defying compositions and his role in revitalizing the garage rock renaissance. His music is marked by organic improvisation, soulful undercurrents, and a commitment to authenticity, making him a sought-after collaborator and a source of inspiration for emerging artists[1][2][3][6].
