## Biography
Lee Dorsey (born Irving Lee Dorsey, December 24, 1924, in Portland, Oregon, raised in New Orleans, Louisiana) and Betty Harris (born September 9, 1939, in Orlando, Florida) were prominent New Orleans soul and R&B artists in the 1960s, known for their collaboration on the duet 'Love Lots of Lovin'' released in 1968 on the Sansu label. Dorsey began his career in the late 1950s with early recordings like 'Rock Pretty Baby' before achieving breakthrough success with 'Ya Ya' in 1961, a million-selling hit produced after meeting Allen Toussaint. Harris entered the scene in 1963 with her slowed-down cover of 'Cry to Me' on Jubilee, produced by Bert Berns, reaching Billboard Hot 100 #23 and R&B #10, followed by 'His Kiss' in 1964. Both artists developed their careers under Toussaint's production at Sansu, blending raw Southern soul with uptempo funk and deep ballads; Dorsey with hits like 'Ride Your Pony' (1965), 'Working in the Coal Mine' (1966), and 'Holy Cow,' while Harris delivered classics such as 'Nearer to You' (1967).[1][2]

Their musical styles epitomized New Orleans R&B: Dorsey's playful, rhythmic delivery and auto-body repairman persona infused songs with gritty authenticity, often backed by the Meters, while Harris's rich, emotive vocals shone in dramatic deep soul ballads and Northern soul favorites like 'I'm Evil Tonight.' After peak success, Harris retired in 1970 to raise a family but returned in 2005 amid a royalties dispute with Toussaint and Marshall Sehorn; Dorsey shifted between music and his repair business, releasing albums like 'Yes We Can' (1970) and touring into the 1980s until his death on December 1, 1986, in New Orleans. Their joint single 'Love Lots of Lovin'' (backed with 'Take Care of Our Love') highlighted their chemistry within the Sansu scene, though they were not a formal duo but individual artists with this key partnership.[1][2][3]

Their legacy endures among soul enthusiasts; Dorsey's whimsical hits influenced funk and pop, covered by artists like the Pointer Sisters ('Yes We Can Can'), while Harris's Sansu output, compiled on 'Soul Perfection' (1969 UK) and 'Soul Perfection Plus' (1999 CD), commands high collector value for its sophisticated Southern soul essence. Despite modest chart peaks, both are revered for quintessential 1960s New Orleans sound.[1][2]
