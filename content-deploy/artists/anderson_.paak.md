## Biography
Brandon Paak Anderson, professionally known as Anderson .Paak, was born on February 8, 1986, in Oxnard, California, to a multicultural family of African American and Korean heritage. His early life was marked by significant hardship: at age seven, he witnessed his father violently attacking his mother, an incident that resulted in his father's arrest and imprisonment for approximately 14 years. During his high school years, his mother—initially a successful strawberry seller—was convicted of defrauding investors of millions through her produce distribution company and received a seven-year prison sentence. Despite these traumatic circumstances, Anderson found solace in music, beginning his musical journey at age 12 when he played drums in his church band. He attended Foothill Technology High School in Ventura, California, where he began rapping and producing music from his bedroom.

After high school, Anderson moved to Los Angeles at age 21 to study drumming at the Musicians Institute in Hollywood, driven by encouragement from a girlfriend who later became his wife. Adopting the stage name Breezy Lovejoy, he worked with the band The Free Nationals while simultaneously working at a marijuana farm in Santa Barbara to support his growing family. In 2011, he was unexpectedly fired from his farm job, leaving him homeless with his wife and infant son. However, producer Shafiq Husayn of Sa-Ra provided crucial assistance, employing Anderson as an assistant, videographer, editor, writer, and producer—a period during which he began recording his debut album. His transformation into Anderson .Paak marked a turning point, with the period dot in his name representing "detail." His debut album *Venice* (2014) and his contributions to Dr. Dre's *Compton* album (2015) established him as a rising talent in hip-hop and R&B.

Anderson .Paak's artistic evolution culminated in widespread recognition through his collaboration with Bruno Mars on Silk Sonic, a neo-funk project celebrating 1970s soul music. Their debut single "Leave the Door Open" became his first number-one hit on the Billboard Hot 100 and earned him four Grammy Awards at the 64th Grammy Awards ceremony, including Song of the Year and Record of the Year. As a three-time Grammy Award winner, Anderson .Paak has established himself as a versatile multi-instrumentalist and producer, creating an eclectic blend of hip-hop, soul, rock, and R&B that defies genre categorization. His journey from homelessness and family trauma to international acclaim represents a remarkable testament to artistic perseverance and creative vision.
