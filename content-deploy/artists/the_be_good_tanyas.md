## Biography
The Be Good Tanyas are an acoustic trio from Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, formed in 1999 and rooted in the folk and Americana traditions.[1][2] The band's origin story is uniquely Canadian, beginning in the Kootenay Mountains where Frazey Ford and Samantha Parton met while working on seasonal tree-planting crews in the early-to-mid 1990s. After discovering their mutual love of music, they parted ways but remained connected. Ford later met Trish Klein while both were attending music school in Nelson, British Columbia, where they participated in open-mic nights and honed their craft. By the late 1990s, each member had explored diverse musical styles—Ford had performed in a trip hop band in Montreal and co-founded the soul/folk band Saltwater June with Klein, while Parton had toured America with spoken word poet Chris Chandler and performed in her country-duo side project, The Illegitimate Daughters of Johnny Cash. Chance reunited the trio in Vancouver in the winter of 1999, leading to the formation of The Be Good Tanyas.[1]

The band's early years were marked by humble beginnings and unexpected success. They began playing weekly at a local thrift store in exchange for clothing, describing themselves as "a hillbilly garage band" that played traditional songs alongside original compositions.[2] Their breakthrough came with their debut album, *Blue Horse*, released independently in November 2000. Though independent record stores initially helped promote the album, it was the Canadian Broadcasting Company's (CBC) frequent airplay that brought them into the spotlight, eventually attracting the attention of Nettwerk Records.[2] *Blue Horse* was named one of 2002's Top 50 albums by Britain's Q Magazine, establishing the band's reputation for lush vocal harmonies and deceptively simple arrangements that blended old-time music with contemporary sensibilities.[1][2] The group followed with *Chinatown* in 2003 and *Hello Love* in 2006, gaining popular and critical success across English-speaking nations including Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States.[2]

In late 2004, the band announced plans for a temporary break from touring, reflecting their philosophy that this music was meant to be played "in your living room with friends after dinner."[2] The group took a more extended hiatus beginning in 2008, during which members pursued solo projects and other musical endeavors.[4] Frazey Ford released her debut solo album *Obadiah* in 2010, while other members explored collaborations—Trish Klein formed Po' Girl with Allison Russell, and Samantha Parton worked with co-founder Jolie Holland on recording and touring projects.[5] Though their active recording and touring period was relatively concentrated, The Be Good Tanyas left an indelible mark on the Americana landscape, creating some of the best Appalachian-influenced music of the early 2000s and establishing themselves as significant figures in the Vancouver folk and old-time music communities.

## Fun Facts
- The band's name comes from a song called 'Be Good Tanya' by Obo Martin, which Jolie Holland introduced to the group.[2]
- Frazey Ford and Samantha Parton initially met while working on seasonal tree-planting crews in the Canadian Kootenay Mountains, where they lived a vagabond lifestyle replenishing forests damaged by the lumber industry.[1]
- The band's first paid performance experience was busking outside the Lilith Fair, where they earned more pot than hard cash.[3] Their first festival gig at the Maine Island Folk Festival drew about 400 people, and Klein recalls they 'totally bombed.'[3]
- The band started their career playing weekly at a local Vancouver thrift store in exchange for clothing, describing themselves as 'very jangly, always on the verge of falling apart.'[2]
