## Biography
Dan Weiss, born in New Jersey and now based in Brooklyn, NY, began playing drums at the age of six, nurtured by a musical family—his father was a guitarist. Early exposure to rock icons like Led Zeppelin, The Who, and Jimi Hendrix shaped his initial musical direction, with John Bonham serving as a formative drumming influence. Weiss pursued formal studies at the Manhattan School of Music, earning a bachelor's degree in jazz percussion and a minor in classical composition, which laid the foundation for his genre-defying career.[3][5]

Weiss's career is marked by a relentless pursuit of musical innovation, blending jazz with influences from Indian classical music, contemporary classical, West African rhythms, and metal. He has studied tabla for over two decades under Pandit Samir Chatterjee, a mentorship that deeply informs his compositional style and drumming technique. Weiss is acclaimed for his angular melodies, complex rhythmic cycles, and the integration of raga-inspired melodic forms. His trio—featuring Jacob Sacks (piano) and Thomas Morgan (bass)—has released several critically acclaimed albums, including 'Now Yes When' (2006), 'Timshel' (2011), 'Utica Box' (2019), and 'Dedication' (2022), noted for their inventive song structures and improvisational depth.[1][2][3][4]

Beyond the trio, Weiss leads large ensembles and genre-crossing projects such as Starebaby, which fuses jazz, metal, and new music. His work is celebrated for pushing the boundaries of modern jazz, earning him recognition as one of the top five jazz drummers by The New York Times and repeated honors in Downbeat's Critic's Poll. Weiss's legacy lies in his fearless synthesis of global musical traditions and his influence on a new generation of improvisers.[1][2][4]
