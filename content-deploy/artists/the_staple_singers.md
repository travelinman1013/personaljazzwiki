## Biography
The Staple Singers were an American gospel, soul, and R&B family singing group formed by patriarch Roebuck 'Pops' Staples (1914–2000), born in Winona, Mississippi, where he was influenced by blues legends like Charley Patton while picking cotton as a teen. In the mid-1930s, Pops moved to Chicago with his wife Oceola and children Cleotha (1934–2013), Pervis (1935–2021), and later Yvonne (1937–2018) and Mavis (b. 1939), beginning local church performances in 1948 with Mavis, then seven, singing bass parts in a Southern quartet style. Their professional recording career started in 1954 with United Records, achieving early hits like 'Uncloudy Day' (1959) on Vee-Jay, blending close vocal harmonies with Pops' tremolo-drenched bluesy guitar in an acoustic gospel-folk style.[1][2][3][4][5]

The group's sound evolved in the 1960s, incorporating folk revival elements and civil rights protest songs like Pops' 'Freedom Highway' on their 1965 Epic live album, alongside covers of Stephen Stills' 'For What It's Worth.' Signing with Stax Records in 1968 marked their mainstream breakthrough, producing soul-folk albums with Steve Cropper, then funkier hits at Muscle Shoals like 'Respect Yourself' (1971), 'I'll Take You There' (No. 1, 1972), and 'If You're Ready (Come Go with Me).' After Stax's bankruptcy, they joined Curtis Mayfield's Curtom for their second No. 1 'Let's Do It Again' (1975), later covering Talking Heads' 'Slippery People' (1984).[1][2][3][5]

Known for seamless gospel-to-pop crossover with optimistic, empowering messages, the Staple Singers influenced generations despite later solo pursuits by members like Mavis Staples, whose albums earned Grammys into the 21st century. They remained active into the 1990s, cementing a legacy of genre-blending hits and social commentary.[2][3]
