## Biography
Tinsley Ellis (born June 4, 1957) is an American blues and rock guitarist, singer, and songwriter, widely regarded as one of the leading electric blues‑rock players of his generation.[2][1] Born in Atlanta, Georgia, and raised in South Florida, he first encountered guitar through mid‑1960s rock and British Invasion bands such as the Yardbirds, the Animals, Cream, the Rolling Stones, and garage‑rock acts like the Standells and Johnny Rivers.[2][1] His passion shifted decisively to blues after hearing artists like Freddie King and, especially, after seeing B.B. King live—an encounter where King broke a string, handed it to the 15‑year‑old Ellis, and helped set him on a lifelong path in the blues.[2] In the mid‑1970s Ellis returned to Atlanta to attend Emory University, playing with the Haygood Band and then his first professional blues group, the Alley Cats, while earning a degree in history in 1979.[2][5]

In 1981 Ellis co‑founded The Heartfixers with veteran singer and harmonica player Chicago Bob Nelson, quickly becoming Atlanta’s top‑drawing blues band and recording several albums for the Landslide label, including a collaboration with Nappy Brown, before disbanding in 1988.[2][1][4] That same year he launched his solo career on Alligator Records with *Georgia Blue*, followed by a long string of critically praised albums that mixed roadhouse blues, Southern rock, and soul‑drenched songwriting; *Billboard* has noted that “nobody has released more consistently excellent blues albums than Atlanta’s Tinsley Ellis.”[2][4] Over the years he recorded for Capricorn and Telarc before returning to Alligator and later issuing releases on his own Heartfixer label, all while touring relentlessly—Ellis has performed in all 50 U.S. states as well as across Europe, Australia, Canada, South America, and beyond.[2][4] Known for powerful, “spine‑tingling” guitar work and gritty, soulful vocals, he has gradually expanded his palette to include more acoustic, folk‑blues textures, culminating in solo acoustic projects such as *Naked Truth*, which showcase his songwriting and storytelling in a stripped‑down, intimate setting.[1][3][4]

Ellis’s musical style draws deeply from electric Chicago and Texas blues, British blues‑rock, and Southern rock traditions, filtered through a modern, song‑oriented sensibility.[1][2][5] His playing emphasizes searing lead lines, vocal‑like bends, and melodic hooks as much as raw power, and critics frequently highlight his combination of virtuosity and taste. Onstage he has long been known as a tireless, high‑energy bandleader, yet his later acoustic work underlines his command of fingerpicking and slide guitar as well.[1][3] Over four decades and more than twenty albums, Ellis has helped keep blues‑rock vital on the touring circuit, mentored younger players, and built a reputation as a “musician’s musician” whose catalog and work ethic have earned him lasting respect in contemporary blues.[2][4][5]

## Fun Facts
- At a B.B. King concert when he was about 15, Ellis was handed one of King’s broken guitar strings; he has said he still owns that string and that the moment cemented his decision to become a blues guitarist.[2]
- Ellis claims to have performed live in all 50 U.S. states at least once, reflecting a relentlessly road‑warrior touring ethic over more than four decades.[2][4]
- Early in his career, Ellis spent a summer playing in a rock band at Six Flags Over Georgia, doing nine shows a day in polyester jumpsuits and performing the long version of “Free Bird” three times daily—an experience he credits with teaching him how to read and adapt to an audience.[5]
- After briefly enrolling in law school at Mercer University, Ellis decided the legal profession was not for him, left after about three weeks, and soon formed The Heartfixers, the band that launched his national blues career.[5]

## Musical Connections

### Mentors/Influences
- [[b.b._king|B.B. King]] - Major early inspiration; a live show where King gave Ellis a broken guitar string convinced Ellis he had to become a blues guitarist. (Live performances that Ellis witnessed as a teenager rather than specific recordings together.) [Early–mid 1970s (Ellis around age 15).]
- [[freddie_king|Freddie King]] - Core stylistic influence; Ellis painstakingly learned Freddie King solos note‑for‑note as part of his blues education. (Ellis has cited working out solos such as “The Stumble” from King’s recordings as a formative study tool.[2][5]) [Mid–late 1970s during his formative years in Atlanta.]
- [[british_invasion_bluesrock_bands_the_yardbirds_the_animals_cream_the_rolling_stones|British Invasion blues‑rock bands (The Yardbirds, The Animals, Cream, The Rolling Stones)]] - Gateway influences that led Ellis from rock into deeper exploration of American electric blues. (Early exposure via their blues‑based singles and albums, which preceded his immersion in artists like B.B. and Freddie King.[1][2]) [Childhood and early teens in the 1960s–early 1970s.]
- [[dana_fastfret_scholl|Dana “Fast‑Fret” Scholl]] - Local Atlanta blues aficionado and roommate who rigorously schooled Ellis in traditional blues, insisting he reproduce classic guitar parts accurately. (Intensive listening and practice with recordings such as Freddie King’s “The Stumble,” repeated and copied from Scholl’s record collection.[5]) [Mid‑to‑late 1970s in Atlanta.]

### Key Collaborators
- [[chicago_bob_nelson|Chicago Bob Nelson]] - Co‑founded and co‑led The Heartfixers, the leading Atlanta blues band of the early–mid 1980s. (Multiple Heartfixers albums on Landslide Records, including *The Heartfixers* and follow‑up releases before the band split in 1988.[1][2][4]) [Approximately 1981–1988.]
- [[nappy_brown|Nappy Brown]] - Veteran R&B/blues singer who fronted The Heartfixers for a collaborative album. (A Heartfixers album recorded with Nappy Brown for Landslide Records, pairing Brown’s vocals with Ellis’s guitar work.[2]) [Mid‑1980s.]
- [[preston_hubbard|Preston Hubbard]] - Bassist in Ellis’s early professional blues band the Alley Cats; later known for his work with the Fabulous Thunderbirds. (Live performances with the Alley Cats in Atlanta’s club scene during Ellis’s early professional years.[2]) [Late 1970s.]
- [[derek_trucks|Derek Trucks]] - Ellis gave the young guitarist an early platform; Trucks made his recording debut on an Ellis project, and Ellis is noted as a mentor figure. (Trucks’s first recorded appearance, at age 15, was on a Tinsley Ellis album (often cited in profiles of both artists).[5]) [Early–mid 1990s.]

### Artists Influenced
- [[derek_trucks|Derek Trucks]] - Cited as one of the notable younger guitarists Ellis has mentored; Ellis provided an early recording opportunity, contributing to Trucks’s emergence as a major modern slide guitarist. (Trucks’s recording debut on a Tinsley Ellis release in 1994, preceding his later work with the Allman Brothers Band and Tedeschi Trucks Band.[5]) [1990s onward.]
