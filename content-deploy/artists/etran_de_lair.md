## Biography
Etran de L'Aïr, meaning 'stars of the Aïr region,' is a Nigerien rock band formed in 1995 in the neighborhood of Abalane, Agadez, Niger, consisting of brothers and cousins from nomadic Tuareg families who settled in the 1970s fleeing droughts. Initially led by Aghaly Migi, the band, including young Moussa “Abindi” Ibra who was just nine at formation, began playing at local weddings and ceremonies, walking miles with guitars and amps strapped to their backs to build a reputation on the wedding circuit over two decades[1][2][3][4][6][7]. Their sound evolved into a pan-African style blending Tuareg Desert blues—first popularized by Tinariwen—with Northern Malian blues, Hausa bar bands, and Congolese Soukous, featuring three guitarists who swap bass and treble roles, hypnotic solos, and Tamasheq vocals[1][2][4][6].

International breakthrough arrived in 2018 with their debut album *No. 1* on Sahel Sounds, hailed as the top album of the year by *The New Yorker*'s Amanda Petrusich, followed by *Agadez* (2022) and *100% Sahara Guitar* (2024), all receiving critical acclaim[1][3][6][7]. Signed to Sahel Sounds, they now tour globally—Europe from 2021, U.S. debut in 2023, and African festivals like Uganda's Nyege Nyege in 2018—sharing Nigerien culture and bringing pride to Agadez amid its urbanization[3][6][7]. Their raw, electrified Saharan rock maintains joy-fueled energy from local roots to worldwide stages[1][3][6].
