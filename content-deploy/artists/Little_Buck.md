## Biography
Charles "Lil Buck" Riley, born May 25, 1988 in Chicago, Illinois, and raised in Memphis, Tennessee, is a renowned movement artist celebrated for bringing Memphis Jookin—a freestyle street dance characterized by intricate footwork and fluid motion—to international prominence. Buck was introduced to Jookin around age 14 and quickly rose through the ranks of the local dance scene, blending his street dance roots with two years of formal ballet training on scholarship[3][4]. This unique combination enabled him to develop a signature style noted for its gravity-defying glides and expressive storytelling.

Lil Buck's career gained widespread attention in 2011 when he performed with cellist Yo-Yo Ma to Saint-Saëns’ "The Swan." The performance, captured and shared online by director Spike Jonze, went viral and established Buck as a global ambassador for Jookin[3][4]. Since then, he has collaborated with Cirque du Soleil’s "Michael Jackson: One," choreographed for Janelle Monáe, toured with Madonna, and danced alongside Mikhail Baryshnikov in Rag & Bone’s fashion campaign. His artistry extends beyond dance into activism and fashion, including co-founding MOVEMENT ART IS, an organization using movement to inspire social change, and designing for Versace[3][4].

Lil Buck's innovative fusion of street and classical dance has influenced both the dance and fashion worlds, making him a sought-after performer and collaborator. His legacy is marked by his ability to bridge cultural and artistic divides, inspiring a new generation of dancers to explore interdisciplinary movement and social impact through art[3][4].

## Fun Facts
- Lil Buck first arrived in Los Angeles with only $20 in his pocket after paying unexpected luggage fees[2].
