## Biography
De La Soul is an American hip hop trio formed in 1988 in Amityville, Long Island, New York, consisting of Posdnuos (Kelvin Mercer), Trugoy the Dove (Dave Jolicoeur), and Maseo (Vincent Mason). Emerging from the local scene, they debuted with the groundbreaking album *3 Feet High and Rising* in 1989, produced by Prince Paul, which blended eclectic samples from funk, soul, pop, jazz, reggae, and psychedelia with clever, humorous lyrics, earning acclaim as a hip hop masterpiece and introducing the 'D.A.I.S.Y. Age' (Da Inner Sound, Y'all) ethos of peace and positivity.[1][2][3] As leaders of the Native Tongues posse alongside A Tribe Called Quest, Jungle Brothers, Queen Latifah, and others, they offered a gentler alternative to hardcore rap, with hits like 'Me Myself and I' reaching Top 40 status and the album topping year-end lists.[1][2]

Their career evolved through challenges, including a lawsuit from The Turtles over an uncleared sample on 'Transmitting Live from Mars,' which influenced sampling practices in hip hop.[1][2] Follow-up albums like *De La Soul Is Dead* (1991) rejected the hippie label with edgier content, while *Buhloone Mindstate* (1993) leaned funkier yet stayed true to their roots; later works such as *Art Official Intelligence: Mosaic Thump* (2000) and *AOI: Bionix* (2001) featured collaborations with Common, Mos Def, and J Dilla, maintaining critical respect amid shifting commercial landscapes dominated by gangsta rap.[1][2] They won a Grammy in 2006 for 'Feel Good Inc.' with Gorillaz.[2]

De La Soul's legacy lies in pioneering jazz rap and alternative hip hop subgenres through innovative sampling and eccentric lyrics, sustaining a thirty-plus-year career marked by creative independence and influence on progressive hip hop, even as they navigated label changes and member health issues, including Trugoy's passing.[2][5]

## Fun Facts
- De La Soul coined 'D.A.I.S.Y. Age' (Da Inner Sound, Y'all) for their positive, neo-psychedelic vibe on their debut, leading to an unwanted 'neo-hippie' label they later rejected with *De La Soul Is Dead*.[1]
- A lawsuit from The Turtles over sampling 'You Showed Me' without clearance on 'Transmitting Live from Mars' set a precedent for hip hop sampling rights.[1][2]
- They launched the Spitkicker Tour and collective in 2000, featuring Common, Biz Markie, Talib Kweli, Pharoahe Monch, Dave Chappelle, and chef Marcus Samuelsson.[2]
- Their debut *3 Feet High and Rising* was hailed as the future of hip-hop and topped The Village Voice's best-of-1989 list.[1]
