## Biography
Sippie Wallace, born Beulah Belle Thomas on November 1, 1898, in Plum Bayou, Arkansas, was a pioneering American blues singer, pianist, and songwriter known as 'The Texas Nightingale.' Raised in a deeply musical family, she moved to Houston, Texas, as a child, where she sang and played piano in church under the guidance of her Baptist deacon father. By her teens, she and her brothers, George and Hersal Thomas, were performing in tent shows, blending sacred and secular music traditions.

Wallace's professional career blossomed in the early 1920s when she moved to Chicago and began recording for Okeh Records. Between 1923 and 1927, she released over 40 songs, many of which she wrote herself or co-wrote with her brothers. Her powerful, expressive voice and rhythmic style placed her alongside blues greats like Ma Rainey and Bessie Smith. Wallace collaborated with jazz luminaries such as Louis Armstrong and King Oliver, further cementing her influence in early blues and jazz circles. After the deaths of her brothers and husband in the 1930s, she withdrew from secular music, serving as an organist and choir director in Detroit for several decades.

The blues revival of the 1960s brought Wallace back to the stage, thanks to encouragement from Victoria Spivey. She recorded and toured with Spivey and later with Bonnie Raitt, who credited Wallace as a major influence. Wallace's comeback included Grammy-nominated recordings and performances at major venues, and her songs resonated with new generations, especially feminists drawn to her strong, independent lyrics. She continued performing until her death in Detroit on November 1, 1986, leaving a lasting legacy as one of the last great classic blues shouters.
