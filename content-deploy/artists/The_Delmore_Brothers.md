## Biography
Alton and Rabon Delmore, known as The Delmore Brothers, were pioneering country music singer-songwriters and musicians who rose to prominence on the Grand Ole Opry in the 1930s. Born into poverty in Elkmont, Alabama, the brothers were raised in a household steeped in gospel music and Appalachian folk traditions, with their mother, Mollie Delmore, a significant influence, writing and singing gospel songs.  This upbringing shaped their musical style, a blend of gospel harmonies, the faster guitar work of traditional folk music, and the blues, contributing to the development of the emerging country genre.  Alton's songwriting began early; at 16, he co-wrote his first song, "Bound for the Shore," with his mother.  Their unique instrumentation included the rare tenor guitar, a four-string instrument previously common in vaudeville.

The Delmore Brothers' career took off with their first recording session for Columbia Records in 1931, followed by a contract with Bluebird Records in 1933, solidifying their place as Grand Ole Opry regulars.  They quickly became the Opry's most popular act, and in 1934, began a successful collaboration with fiddler Arthur Smith, forming the Arthur Smith Trio.  This trio recorded extensively for three years, releasing over 52 sides.  Despite their success, disagreements with Opry management led to their departure in 1938, after which they moved to WPTF in Raleigh, North Carolina.  While they continued recording and performing throughout the 1940s, their later success never matched their Opry heights.  Their career included recordings for King Records, often under pseudonyms like Alton's "Jim Scott," and their recordings spanned various locations across the Southern United States.  Their song "When It's Time for the Whippoorwill to Sing" reached the Billboard "Hillbilly" top three in 1941.  "Freight Train Boogie" (1946) is considered by some to be one of the first rock and roll records, and their best-known song, "Blues Stay Away From Me" (1949), was covered by numerous artists.  Alton Delmore wrote over a thousand songs during his career.

The Delmore Brothers' musical style, characterized by their distinctive harmonies and guitar work, played a crucial role in establishing the guitar as a central instrument in country music and its subsequent evolution into rockabilly and rock and roll.  Their use of the tenor guitar also added a unique dimension to their sound.  The brothers' influence on subsequent generations of musicians is undeniable, with Bob Dylan famously stating his admiration for their harmonies.  The Delmore Brothers' legacy is cemented through their induction into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame, the Alabama Music Hall of Fame, and the Country Music Hall of Fame, as well as recognition from the Rockabilly Hall of Fame.  Their prolific output, including over 200 recordings under their own name and many more under pseudonyms, continues to inspire and influence musicians today.  Alton Delmore's posthumously published autobiography, *Truth is Stranger than Publicity*, offers further insight into their lives and careers.
