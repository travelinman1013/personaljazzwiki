## Biography
Eddie Bo, born Edwin Joseph Bocage on September 20, 1930, in New Orleans, Louisiana, emerged from a family deeply rooted in the city’s traditional jazz community. Raised in Algiers and the Ninth Ward, Bo was surrounded by music from an early age—his mother was a self-taught pianist, and his cousins played in prominent jazz orchestras before World War II. After graduating from Booker T. Washington High School and serving in the Army, Bo returned to New Orleans to study composition and arranging at the Grunewald School of Music, where he developed a distinctive piano style influenced by jazz greats like Art Tatum and Oscar Peterson, as well as local legend Professor Longhair.[1][2][3]

Bo’s career began in earnest in the mid-1950s, debuting on Ace Records in 1955. Over the next five decades, he recorded for more than 40 labels and released more singles than any New Orleans artist except Fats Domino. His songwriting prowess produced classics such as “Check Mr. Popeye,” “I’m Wise” (later a hit for Little Richard as “Slippin’ and Slidin’”), and “My Dearest Darling,” which became a national hit for Etta James. Bo was also a prolific producer and arranger, working with artists like Irma Thomas, Art Neville, and Robert Parker. His music traversed jazz, R&B, blues, and funk, and he was instrumental in shaping the New Orleans sound from the 1950s through the funk era of the 1970s.[1][2][3][4]

Despite being described as an “underappreciated veteran” of the New Orleans R&B scene, Eddie Bo’s influence is profound. His innovative piano techniques, genre-blending compositions, and contributions as a producer and arranger have left a lasting legacy in American music. He continued performing and recording until his death on March 18, 2009, in Picayune, Mississippi, leaving behind a rich catalog that continues to inspire musicians worldwide.[1][2][6]
