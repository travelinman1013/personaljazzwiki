## Biography
Iman Europe is a multifaceted singer, songwriter, rapper, and author, born in New York and raised in Los Angeles, California. Her upbringing in both cities has deeply influenced her music, which fuses the melodic sensibilities of the East Coast with the vibrant harmonies of the West Coast. Coming from a family with musical and literary roots—her father is a musician and her mother a wordsmith—Iman’s creative path was shaped early on, and she began playing piano at age seven. She later earned a Bachelor’s degree in Creative Writing from UC Riverside, which she credits for refining her songwriting and lyrical craft.

Iman’s career took off after she independently funded and released her debut album 'Nami' in 2018, following a successful Kickstarter campaign. The album’s success led to her music being featured on soundtracks for HBO’s 'Insecure,' Netflix’s 'Nappily Ever After,' and Disney’s 'Good Trouble.' She has since released projects including 'LA Lovechild' and has performed at major events like SXSW and Coachella. Her style is a blend of R&B, Soul, Hip-Hop, and Electronic elements, characterized by relatable lyricism and a focus on themes of love, growth, and self-discovery. Iman is also recognized for her work in the Web3 music space, serving as Head of Artist Relations at Sound.xyz and selling out several NFT collections.

Known for her authenticity and inspirational presence, Iman Europe has built a loyal fanbase and garnered attention from brands and media outlets such as Forbes, Bloomberg, and Vibe. Her mission is to inspire listeners to evolve into their higher selves, and she continues to push creative boundaries while remaining independent in the industry.
