- **Origin**: New York

## Biography
The Sha La Das are a Brooklyn‑based vocal soul group built around the **Schalda family**: father Bill Schalda and his sons Will (often credited as Swivs), Paul, and Carmine.[3][4][1] Bill grew up in Brooklyn’s doo‑wop and R&B scene of the 1960s, singing Moonglows and Flamingos tunes in neighborhood vocal groups such as The Montereys and learning his craft on street corners and in schoolyards where harmony singing was a nightly ritual.[3] Years later, after moving to Staten Island, he passed this tradition directly to his children, teaching them parts on songs—famously even the Sesame Street theme—while they sang together on the stoop of their family home.[3][4]

By the 2010s the three brothers had become accomplished musicians in their own right: Will toured the world as keyboardist for Charles Bradley & His Extraordinaires, Paul led his own project Paul & The Tall Trees and also played guitar and sang with Bradley’s band, and Carmine likewise developed as a singer and musician.[3][1] Their family group coalesced after producer and Dunham/Daptone musician Thomas Brenneck heard the four Schaldas singing close harmonies while they were in a Brooklyn studio recording background vocals for Charles Bradley’s album *Victim of Love*; struck by their sound, he pushed to capture it on record.[3] The result was their debut album *Love in the Wind*, released on Daptone’s Dunham imprint in 2018, an 11‑song set that reimagines classic doo‑wop harmony within a vintage soul framework, drawing comparisons to groups like The Manhattans and The Moments while remaining deeply personal and atmospheric.[3][7][8][9] Since then, The Sha La Das have been recognized for their moody yet lush blend of doo‑wop, blues, and soul, and for carrying forward the lineage of classic vocal‑group harmony into a contemporary retro‑soul context.[1][2][8] Their work adds a distinctive family‑based chapter to the Daptone Records story alongside artists such as Sharon Jones and Charles Bradley, emphasizing organic musicianship, analogue production, and emotionally direct songwriting.[3][5][7]

Although still relatively early in their discography, The Sha La Das’ legacy already rests on the authenticity of Bill’s first‑generation doo‑wop experience paired with the modern sensibilities of his sons, who are deeply embedded in New York’s soul revival scene.[3][8][9] Their music has been praised by soul and retro‑soul press for its warmth, tight harmonies, and cinematic evocation of mid‑century New York, from Coney Island boardwalk imagery to late‑night street‑corner reveries.[3][9] As part of the broader Daptone/Dunham circle of musicians, they help bridge generations of Black American vocal traditions and contemporary independent soul, inspiring a new wave of listeners and artists seeking the emotional impact of classic harmony groups rendered with present‑day intimacy.[3][5][7]

## Fun Facts
- The group is literally a **family quartet**: all four members share the surname Schalda, with father Bill singing alongside his three sons Will, Paul, and Carmine.[3][4][1]
- Bill Schalda honed his craft singing street‑corner doo‑wop in Brooklyn in the 1960s, then later taught his sons harmony by having them sing songs like the **Sesame Street** theme together on the stoop of their Staten Island home.[3]
- The Sha La Das first came to producer Thomas Brenneck’s attention not through their own project but while recording **background vocals** for Charles Bradley’s album *Victim of Love*; hearing their blend in the studio convinced him they needed their own record.[3]
- When they released their debut album *Love in the Wind* on Daptone’s Dunham label in 2018, the Schaldas initially thought the project might be a **one‑off**, but its reception helped cement them as part of the modern soul‑revival landscape.[7]
