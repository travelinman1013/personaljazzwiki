## Biography
Compay Segundo, born Máximo Francisco Repilado Muñoz Telles on November 18, 1907, in the coastal town of Siboney, in the province of Santiago de Cuba, grew up at the heart of Cuba’s emerging son tradition. As a child he moved with his family to nearby Santiago de Cuba, where he joined the Municipal Band and began formal musical training, first on the clarinet and later on guitar and the tres. Over the 1920s and 1930s he absorbed the repertoire and techniques of older trovadores and soneros, playing with local groups and gradually developing the relaxed, behind‑the‑beat vocal delivery that became his trademark.

By the 1930s he had relocated to Havana, performing as a clarinetist in the capital’s municipal band while working in small ensembles and popular conjuntos, and he soon became associated with leading son groups such as El Conjunto Matamoros. In the late 1940s he formed the vocal and guitar duo Los Compadres with Lorenzo Hierrezuelo, taking the stage name “Compay Segundo” in reference to his usual role as second voice. During these years he also invented the armónico, a custom seven‑string, guitar‑like instrument designed to bridge the harmonic space between the Spanish guitar and the tres, and he composed a large catalog of sones, including what would later become his signature song, “Chan Chan.” In 1956 he founded his own group, Compay Segundo y sus Muchachos, maintaining a classic son lineup and continuing to perform and record primarily within Cuba for decades.

Although highly respected at home, Compay Segundo achieved worldwide recognition only late in life. In the 1990s he returned to international touring and gained global fame through his central role in the Buena Vista Social Club project, where his warm baritone, traditional son phrasing, and compositions introduced millions of listeners to pre‑revolutionary Cuban styles. His music blended rural son, trova songcraft, bolero romanticism, and subtle jazz inflections while remaining firmly rooted in the structures and rhythms of eastern Cuban son. He continued to record and tour into his nineties, often performing with a multigenerational version of his group that included his son Salvador Repilado on bass, and he became a symbolic guardian of Cuba’s musical heritage until his death in Havana on July 13, 2003.

## Fun Facts
- His stage name “Compay Segundo” comes from a colloquial shortening of “compadre” plus “segundo,” referring to his customary role as second voice in vocal duos.
- He invented a custom seven‑string, guitar‑like instrument called the armónico to bridge the harmonic gap between the standard guitar and the tres in Cuban son ensembles.
- Before music provided a steady living, he worked various jobs in Havana, including as a cigar roller and hairdresser, while performing in bars and small venues.
- His global breakthrough came when he was around 90 years old, through the Buena Vista Social Club project, making him one of the most celebrated late‑career success stories in popular music.
