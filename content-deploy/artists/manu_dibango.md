# Manu Dibango

## Biography
Emmanuel N'Djoké Dibango, known as Manu Dibango, was born on December 12, 1933, in Douala, Cameroon, to a Yabassi father and Duala mother. Sent to France at age 15 for studies in Saint-Calais and later Chartres, he discovered piano and immersed himself in the local culture, developing a passion for jazz influenced by artists like Duke Ellington and Charlie Parker. After failing finals in 1956, he moved to Brussels, where he honed his skills in jazz clubs, married Belgian actress Marie-Josée (Coco) in 1957, and joined Joseph Kabasele's African Jazz band, contributing to the Congolese rumba revolution and the pan-African hit 'Indépendance Cha Cha' in 1959.[1][2][6]

## Fun Facts
- "Soul Makossa" (1972) is the most sampled African song in history, notably used without permission by Michael Jackson and Kanye West, prompting Dibango's lawsuits.[1][2]
- His band was the first African group to perform a 10-day stand at Harlem's Apollo Theater alongside Edwin Starr and the Temptations.[2]
- Dibango released over 70 albums and composed more than a dozen film scores across his career.[4]
- He was appointed UNESCO Artist for Peace in 2004 and received the French Legion of Honor in 2010.[1][6]
