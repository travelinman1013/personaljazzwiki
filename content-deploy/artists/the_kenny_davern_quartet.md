## Biography
The Kenny Davern Quartet was one of the working ensembles led by American jazz clarinetist **Kenny Davern** (John Kenneth Davern), a central figure in traditional and mainstream jazz from the 1950s through the early 2000s. Born in Huntington, Long Island, New York, in 1935, Davern was largely self‑taught and began playing professionally as a teenager, sitting in with established New York bands by age sixteen.[1][3][6] Early stints with trombonist Jack Teagarden and trumpeters Phil Napoleon and Pee Wee Erwin, among others, immersed him in swing and Dixieland, grounding the stylistic language that would later define his small‑group quartets.[1][3][6]

Over the decades Davern worked in big bands and classic jazz combos, toured with the Dukes of Dixieland, and co‑led the acclaimed Soprano Summit with Bob Wilber in the 1970s before refocusing on clarinet‑led small groups.[1][6] Under his own name he fronted various quartets; one documented configuration, heard on “The Kenny Davern Quartet: In Concert at the Outpost Performance Space, Albuquerque, 2004,” pairs Davern’s clarinet with James Chirillo (guitar), Greg Cohen (bass), and Tony DeNicola (drums), playing classic standards and trad repertoire with relaxed virtuosity and buoyant swing.[1] These quartets showcased Davern’s highly personal time feel, his affectionate yet modern treatment of early jazz tunes, and a conversational interplay between clarinet and rhythm section. Davern’s work with such groups reinforced the clarinet’s place in contemporary traditional jazz and influenced later clarinetists and mainstream players who drew on his blend of historical awareness and idiosyncratic phrasing.[1][4][6]

Davern remained active as a bandleader and recording artist into the 2000s, releasing albums such as “Live at the Floating Jazz Festival,” “Grenadilla,” and “No One But Kenny,” often in quartet or similarly intimate formats.[1][6] Critics highlighted his ability to personalize older repertoire, comparing his rhythmic conception to innovators like Thelonious Monk and noting his flexible approach to chord changes and bar lines while staying rooted in song form.[1] He died of a heart attack in December 2006 at age 71, leaving behind a legacy as one of the foremost modern clarinet voices in traditional and small‑group jazz; the Kenny Davern Quartet recordings stand as a vivid testament to his late‑career artistry.[1][4][6]

## Fun Facts
- Kenny Davern (leader of the Kenny Davern Quartet) appeared onscreen in the classic 1961 film “The Hustler” starring Paul Newman, one of several non‑concert settings where his playing was featured.[1]
- He performed not only in jazz clubs and festivals but also in theatrical productions, including the Broadway show “Marathon ’33” and the Off‑Broadway show “One Mo’ Time.”[1]
- Davern once co‑led the group Soprano Summit, focusing on soprano saxophone before turning his attention decisively back to the clarinet, which then became the centerpiece of his quartet work.[1][6]
- His 1985 recording “The Very Thought of You” won the Music Trades Association Award as Best Jazz Record of the Year in England, and he had earlier been voted the number‑one clarinetist in the world by readers of the English Jazz Journal, acclaim that helped elevate interest in his later quartet projects.[1]

## Musical Connections

### Mentors/Influences
- [[pee_wee_russell|Pee Wee Russell]] - Major stylistic inspiration for Davern’s clarinet conception and early focus on Dixieland and traditional jazz. (General influence heard across Davern’s small‑group and quartet recordings rather than specific shared projects.) [Influence from Davern’s teens in the early 1950s onward.[2][6]]

### Key Collaborators
- [[james_chirillo|James Chirillo]] - Guitarist in the Kenny Davern Quartet, providing harmonic support and counter‑melodies on standards and classic jazz tunes. (Album “The Kenny Davern Quartet: In Concert at the Outpost Performance Space, Albuquerque, 2004.”) [Documented collaboration in 2004.[1]]
- [[greg_cohen|Greg Cohen]] - Bassist in the Kenny Davern Quartet, anchoring rhythm and interacting closely with Davern’s phrasing. (“The Kenny Davern Quartet: In Concert at the Outpost Performance Space, Albuquerque, 2004.”) [Documented collaboration in 2004.[1]]
- [[tony_denicola|Tony DeNicola]] - Drummer in the Kenny Davern Quartet, contributing swinging, unobtrusive drive to the group’s sound. (“The Kenny Davern Quartet: In Concert at the Outpost Performance Space, Albuquerque, 2004.”) [Documented collaboration in 2004.[1]]
- [[bob_wilber|Bob Wilber]] - Co‑leader with Davern of Soprano Summit, an important small‑group precursor and parallel to Davern’s own quartets. (Soprano Summit recordings beginning with sessions released in the mid‑1970s.) [Early–mid 1970s and beyond.[1][6]]

### Artists Influenced
- [[later_traditional_and_mainstream_jazz_clarinetists_e.g._contemporary_swingarbors_records_circle|Later traditional and mainstream jazz clarinetists (e.g., contemporary swing/Arbors Records circle)]] - Davern’s highly individual clarinet style within traditional frameworks became a reference point for younger players interested in pre‑bop idioms with modern phrasing. (Influence reflected broadly in later traditional‑jazz recordings; specific direct protégés are not clearly documented in available sources.) [Primarily from the 1980s through the 2000s and after his death.[1][4]]
