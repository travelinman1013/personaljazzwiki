## Biography
Pedro Pablo “Pedrito” Martinez, born on September 12, 1973, in the Cayo Hueso neighborhood of Old Havana, Cuba, is widely recognized as one of the most influential percussionists and vocalists in contemporary Latin jazz, timba, and son cubano. Immersed in the rich traditions of rumba and Afro-Cuban Yoruba music from an early age, Martinez began performing professionally at age 11, quickly establishing himself within Havana’s vibrant music scene. His early career included collaborations with major rumba groups such as Yoruba Andabo and Obba Ilu, and he became renowned for his mastery of the batá drum and congas[1][2][6].

In 1998, Martinez relocated to New York City, where his career flourished through collaborations with a diverse array of artists, including Wynton Marsalis, Paul Simon, Paquito D’Rivera, Bruce Springsteen, Dave Matthews, and Sting. He contributed to over 100 albums and became the world’s first-call rumbero, performing, singing, and dancing with dozens of Cuban rumba groups. Martinez was a founding member of the influential Afro-Cuban/Afro-Beat band Yerba Buena, recording two albums and touring internationally in the late 1990s. In 2005, he formed The Pedrito Martinez Group in New York, whose debut album was Grammy-nominated and acclaimed by NPR and The Boston Globe as one of the best albums of 2013[2][3][4][7].

Martinez’s musical style is defined by his virtuosic percussion, deep knowledge of Afro-Cuban folkloric traditions, and innovative blending of jazz, timba, and son cubano. His legacy is marked by his role in bringing Afro-Cuban rhythms to new audiences, his collaborations with jazz and pop luminaries, and his influence on a new generation of Latin and jazz musicians[2][3][5].
