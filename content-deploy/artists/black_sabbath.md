## Biography
Black Sabbath, formed in Birmingham, England in 1968 by Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, Ozzy Osbourne, and Bill Ward, are widely recognized as pioneers of heavy metal. The band members grew up in the industrial, working-class neighborhood of Aston, where the harsh sounds of factories shaped their musical sensibilities and inspired the dense, heavy sound that would become their trademark[5][6]. Initially performing blues rock under the names Polka Tulk Blues Band and Earth, they soon adopted the name Black Sabbath, drawing inspiration from horror films and occult themes, which set them apart from their contemporaries[4][1]. Their early albums—'Black Sabbath' and 'Paranoid' (both 1970), followed by 'Master of Reality' (1971)—introduced ominous guitar riffs, slow tempos, and dark, horror-inspired lyrics, laying the foundation for heavy metal as a genre[4][2].

Throughout the 1970s, Black Sabbath's music was often shunned by critics and radio, but their relentless touring and unique style earned them a massive following. Songs like 'Paranoid,' 'Iron Man,' and 'War Pigs' became metal anthems, and the band sold millions of records, influencing countless musicians[2][1]. The group underwent several lineup changes, most notably when Ozzy Osbourne left in 1978 due to substance abuse, replaced by Ronnie James Dio. Tony Iommi remained the band's constant member through decades of evolving lineups, with periodic reunions of the original members[1][4]. Black Sabbath's legacy is cemented by their induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2006, multiple Grammy Awards, and their role as the standard-bearers of heavy metal[2][4].

Their final studio album, '13' (2013), reunited Osbourne, Butler, and Iommi, and topped charts worldwide. Black Sabbath concluded their career with a farewell tour in 2016 and a final show in Birmingham in 2017, commemorated by the live album and film 'The End: Live in Birmingham.' Their influence on rock and metal is profound, with their innovative use of down-tuned guitars, dark imagery, and powerful riffs inspiring generations of musicians[2][4].
