## Biography
Roberta Cleopatra Flack (February 10, 1937 – February 24, 2025) was an American singer and pianist renowned for her emotive, genre-blending ballads that seamlessly traversed R&B, jazz, folk, and pop music. Born and raised with classical piano training from an early age, she received a full music scholarship at age 15 to attend Howard University, where she would later meet her future duet partner Donny Hathaway. Before pursuing music professionally, Flack worked as a teacher at several junior high schools in Washington, D.C., including Banneker, Browne, and Rabaut, while also teaching private piano lessons from her home.

Flack's transition from educator to performer began in the early 1960s when she started accompanying opera singers at the prestigious Tivoli Opera House club in Georgetown. Her breakthrough moment came in December 1967 when she was asked to switch from opera music to Christmas carols and found herself singing 'The Christmas Song' to an appreciative audience. This led to regular performances at local clubs, including the 1520 Club and eventually Mr. Henry's Restaurant on Capitol Hill. Her discovery came in 1968 when jazz musician Les McCann heard her perform at a benefit concert for the Inner City Ghetto Children's Library Fund and was so captivated that he arranged an audition with Atlantic Records producer Joel Dorn. She performed 42 songs in three hours, leading to an immediate record deal and the release of her debut album 'First Take' in 1969.

Flack became a defining voice of 1970s popular music, achieving unprecedented success as the first artist to win the Grammy Award for Record of the Year in consecutive years with 'The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face' (1973) and 'Killing Me Softly with His Song' (1974). Her musical style contributed significantly to the birth of the quiet storm radio format, and she maintained a successful career spanning decades with hits like 'Feel Like Makin' Love,' collaborations with Donny Hathaway, and later duets with artists like Peabo Bryson and Maxi Priest. Notably, she used the pseudonym 'Rubina Flake' (her actual given name) for producing credits on her fifth album 'Feel Like Makin' Love,' using this identity to break barriers for Black women in the music industry during an era of significant racism and sexism.

## Fun Facts
- She used her actual given name 'Rubina Flake' as a pseudonym for producing credits, specifically to break barriers for Black women in the music industry during an era of significant discrimination.
- Flack performed 42 songs from her nightclub repertoire in just three hours during her Atlantic Records audition, and later recorded 39 song demos in less than 10 hours.
- Her debut album 'First Take' was recorded in only 10 hours and represented 'an elegant fusion of folk, jazz and soul.'
- The pivotal moment in her singing career came in December 1967 when she was asked to switch from opera music to Christmas carols at the Tivoli Opera House, leading to her first experience singing 'The Christmas Song' for an audience.
