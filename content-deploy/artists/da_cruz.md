## Biography
Da Cruz is a Brazilian-Swiss world music and electronic group formed in 2005, centered on Brazilian vocalist **Mariana Da Cruz** and Swiss producer **Ane Hebeisen (Ane H.)**.[2][3] The project took shape after Hebeisen, then known from the Swiss industrial-electro band Swamp Terrorists, met Mariana—who was singing Bossa Nova in an Irish pub in Lisbon—while touring Portugal.[2] Following this meeting and Mariana’s subsequent move to Switzerland, guitarist **Oliver Husmann** and drummer/percussionist **Pit Lee** joined to complete the core lineup, with horn players such as trumpeter Nik Hurny and saxophonist Marc Stucki supporting the group live.[2] The band is based between Bern and São Paulo and is often described as an “urban, Afro‑Brazilian” project that uses music as a stance against hatred and political short‑sightedness.[1]

Across albums including *Nova Estação* (2007), *Corpo Elétrico* (2008), *Sistema Subversiva* (2011), *Disco e Progresso* (2014), and *Eco do Futuro* (2017), Da Cruz has developed a style that fuses Brazilian genres such as Bossa Nova, MPB and baile funk with Afrobeat, dub, hip hop, electro, synth‑punk and other African‑diasporic rhythms.[1][2] Critics have praised their work as an “edgy fusion” of Brazilian styles with electronic and global influences, marked by loud synths, booming bass and colorful, club‑ready grooves.[2] The group’s records have repeatedly charted in American college radio top‑10s, and tracks like “Boom Boom Boom” from *Sistema Subversiva* reached world music charts and were featured by tastemaker outlets such as KEXP.[2] A defining thread in their work is Mariana Da Cruz’s ongoing search for her Afro‑Brazilian roots—shaped by travels to places like Burkina Faso, Bahia and Rio—which she channels into lyrics and performances that link Brazilian and African sound worlds.[1]

Da Cruz’s music is frequently characterized as a collision of seemingly incompatible elements: Mariana’s foundation in traditional Brazilian song (Bossa Nova, MPB, classic artists such as Elis Regina and Jorge Ben) intersecting with Ane H.’s background in industrial, post‑punk and Afrobeat, influenced by artists like Fela Kuti and the avant‑garde edge of bands such as Swans and Suicide.[1] This synthesis has positioned Da Cruz within contemporary global bass and world‑fusion scenes, where they are regarded as part of a growing movement connecting Brazilian popular music with European club culture and broader African‑diasporic aesthetics.[1][2] While their long‑term legacy is still evolving, their consistent critical reception, chart presence in college/world radio, and reputation for politically conscious, dance‑driven performances have secured them a notable place in 21st‑century world‑fusion music.[1][2]

## Fun Facts
- The band Da Cruz was born from a chance meeting in an Irish pub in Lisbon, where Swiss producer Ane H., on tour with another project, encountered Brazilian singer Mariana Da Cruz performing Bossa Nova; this led directly to their collaboration and the formation of the group in 2005.[2]
- Before becoming a touring vocalist, Mariana Da Cruz grew up as the seventh child of a cotton picker and a cook in Paranapanema, a small town in São Paulo state, and first absorbed music through a simple transistor radio because records, concerts and formal lessons were unaffordable.[1]
- An important creative engine for Da Cruz is Mariana’s search for her Afro‑Brazilian ancestry: she has traveled to Burkina Faso, Bahia, Rio de Janeiro and other places to trace cultural and musical connections, feeding those experiences back into the band’s lyrics and sound.[1]
- Each of Da Cruz’s first six records is reported to have reached the Top 10 of American college radio charts, giving this Brazilian‑Swiss world‑fusion project an unusually strong foothold in US alternative and world‑music broadcasting.[1][2]
