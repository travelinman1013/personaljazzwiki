## Biography
The Ahmad Jamal Trio, led by pianist Ahmad Jamal (born Frederick Russell Jones, July 2, 1930, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania), was pivotal in shaping modern jazz piano trio performance. Jamal began piano studies at age three and made his professional debut by age eleven, drawing early inspiration from pianists Art Tatum and Erroll Garner. After graduating from George Westinghouse High School, he toured with George Hudson's Orchestra and joined the Four Strings, a group that would eventually evolve into his own trio, the Three Strings, in 1951. With the support of influential producer John Hammond, Jamal began recording for Okeh Records, marking the start of a career that would span more than six decades.

The Ahmad Jamal Trio gained national attention with the 1958 live album 'At the Pershing: But Not for Me,' featuring bassist Israel Crosby and drummer Vernel Fournier. Their innovative approach—marked by Jamal's use of space, dynamic contrasts, and orchestral textures—set a new standard for jazz trios and influenced countless musicians. The trio's signature rendition of 'Poinciana' became a jazz classic, and their interplay and arrangements inspired both contemporaries and future generations. Jamal's music, often described as 'chamber-like jazz,' combined intricate group dynamics with a refined sense of swing, and he continued to perform, record, and compose well into the 21st century.

Jamal's legacy is profound: he was a National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master and a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award recipient. His recordings have been featured in films and dance productions worldwide, and his trio's sound remains a benchmark for jazz musicians. Jamal's influence is particularly notable in his approach to rhythm, space, and melodic reinterpretation, which helped redefine the possibilities of the jazz piano trio.
