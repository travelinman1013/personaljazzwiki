## Biography
Bradford Alexander Mehldau, born August 23, 1970, in Jacksonville, Florida, is an American jazz pianist, composer, and arranger whose innovative style and eclectic repertoire have made him one of the most influential jazz artists of his generation[2][3]. Mehldau began classical piano studies at age six and discovered jazz in his early teens, inspired by hearing Keith Jarrett’s Bremen/Lausanne solo concert[1]. He attended the Hall High School jazz band in Hartford, Connecticut, before moving to New York City in 1988 to study at The New School, where his teachers included jazz pianists Junior Mance, Fred Hersch, and Kenny Werner[3][4]. Early professional experience came with saxophonist Christopher Hollyday’s band and drummer Jimmy Cobb, helping Mehldau develop his own sound influenced by Wynton Kelly and McCoy Tyner[4].

Mehldau’s career took off in the mid-1990s as a member of Joshua Redman’s quartet, but he is best known for leading his own trio, initially with bassist Larry Grenadier and drummer Jorge Rossy (later replaced by Jeff Ballard in 2005)[1][2][3]. The trio’s sensitive interplay and Mehldau’s arrangements in uncommon meters became hallmarks, showcased in the acclaimed Art of the Trio series (1997–2001) and subsequent albums like Anything Goes (2004) and Blues and Ballads (2016)[3]. Mehldau has also distinguished himself as a solo pianist, with albums such as Elegiac Cycle (1999) and After Bach (2018) demonstrating his virtuosity and versatility[3]. His willingness to incorporate rock, pop, and classical elements—evident in covers of Radiohead, Nick Drake, and The Beatles, as well as original compositions—has expanded the jazz piano palette and influenced musicians across genres[1][2][3].

## Fun Facts
- Mehldau’s 2002 album Largo featured arrangements of songs by Black Sabbath and The Beatles, blending rock with jazz in a way that was groundbreaking for the genre[1].
- He has composed music for film soundtracks, including Ma femme est un actrice (2001), and played on several others before that[3].
- Mehldau’s 2022 album Jacob’s Ladder was inspired by his teenage love for progressive rock bands like Rush, Gentle Giant, and Yes, reinterpreted through a biblical lens[1].
- Despite his jazz fame, Mehldau has maintained a deep connection to classical music, even releasing an album of solo Bach interpretations (After Bach, 2018)[1][3].
