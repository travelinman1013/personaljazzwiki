## Biography
The Art Ensemble of Chicago emerged in 1966 from the vibrant creative music scene of Chicago's South Side, rooted in the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians (AACM). Founded by saxophonist Roscoe Mitchell, the group initially included bassist Malachi Favors and trumpeter Lester Bowie, who joined after attending an AACM meeting and famously remarked, "I had never seen so many weird motherfuckers in my life." Saxophonist Joseph Jarman became a permanent member in 1968, solidifying the cooperative quartet that would revolutionize avant-garde jazz.

In 1969, under Bowie's leadership as AACM president, the group relocated to Paris, with Bowie selling his house, furniture, and Bentley to finance the move. The quartet settled in Saint-Leu-la-Forêt outside Paris, where they established their "cooperative economics" model—pooling all income and expenses collectively. During their European period (1969-1971), they recorded an astonishing fifteen albums and adopted their definitive name, Art Ensemble of Chicago. Percussionist Don Moye joined in 1970, completing the lineup that would define the group for decades. Their sound incorporated theatrical elements, "little instruments" like bells and whistles, poetry, spoken word, and a philosophy they termed "Great Black Music: Ancient to the Future."

Returning to America in 1971, the Art Ensemble achieved their breakthrough performance at the 1972 Ann Arbor Blues & Jazz Festival before ten thousand people, sharing the stage with Muddy Waters. This led to a contract with Atlantic Records, joining a roster that included Led Zeppelin and John Coltrane. Throughout their career, they recorded for diverse labels including Delmark, ECM, BYG, and DIW, maintaining their avant-garde vision while becoming the leading practitioners of the AACM's artistic principles. Despite the passing of Favors in 2004, Bowie in 1999, and Jarman in 2019, Mitchell and Moye continued to perform under the Art Ensemble name, preserving the legacy of one of jazz's most innovative and enduring collectives.

## Fun Facts
- When the Art Ensemble moved to Paris in 1969, they traveled by ship with "several hundred musical instruments that weighed over two tons," settling in a country house surrounded by cherry and apple trees where they could rehearse in isolation.
- The group adopted a "cooperative economics" model in their French country house, where all income from shows and recordings went into a collective fund that covered everyone's expenses equally, from food to equipment—a radical extension of AACM principles.
- During their prolific 1969 European period alone, the Art Ensemble recorded seven albums, including classics like 'A Jackson In Your House,' 'Message To Our Folks,' and 'People In Sorrow,' establishing their signature sound that incorporated theatrical elements, poetry, and "little instruments" like bicycle horns, bells, and woodblocks.
- Their breakthrough American performance came at the 1972 Ann Arbor Blues & Jazz Festival before a crowd of ten thousand, sharing the stage with blues legend Muddy Waters. Atlantic Records executive Michael Cuscuna was so impressed that he signed them immediately, releasing a live recording of that very performance as 'Bap-tizum.'
