## Biography
Sarah Wilson is a multifaceted American trumpeter, vocalist, and composer, born and raised in Healdsburg, California. Her early musical influences stemmed from her mother's love of 1970s singer-songwriters, which laid the foundation for her eclectic approach to music[1]. Initially drawn to anthropology and theater at UC Berkeley, Wilson's creative journey took a pivotal turn when she joined Vermont’s Bread and Puppet Theater, where she wrote and conducted music for their productions and rekindled her passion for the trumpet[3].

In 1993, Wilson moved to New York City to focus on music, immersing herself in the city's vibrant jazz scene while also serving as music director for Lincoln Center’s annual puppet program[3]. Her career has been marked by a dynamic interplay between jazz, avant-pop, Afro-Latin grooves, and indie rock, as well as collaborations with dance, theater, and film[2][4]. Wilson’s discography includes critically acclaimed albums such as 'Trapeze Project' (2010) and 'Kaleidoscope' (2021), both released on Brass Tonic Records and featuring top improvisers like Myra Melford, Matt Wilson, Charles Burnham, Jerome Harris, and John Schott[2][4].

After relocating to the Bay Area in 2005, Wilson became deeply involved in community-based arts projects, including 'Tenderloin Voices,' a vocal music production working with formerly shelterless youth[2]. Her innovative compositions and interdisciplinary collaborations have earned her numerous commissions and residencies, establishing her as one of the most intriguing and promising composers and trumpeters on the contemporary music scene[2][4].
