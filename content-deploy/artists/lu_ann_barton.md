## Biography
Lou Ann Barton, born February 17, 1954, in Fort Worth, Texas, emerged as a prominent blues singer after moving to Austin in the 1970s. She began her career in the local scene, joining the Triple Threat Revue in late 1977 alongside Stevie Ray Vaughan and W.C. Clark, which became Double Trouble after Clark's departure in 1978; Barton remained with the band until November 1979[1]. In the early 1980s, she performed with Roomful of Blues, catching the attention of producer Jerry Wexler, leading to her debut album *Old Enough* (1982) on Asylum Records, co-produced with Glenn Frey[1].

Barton's musical style blends blues and jump blues, characterized by her powerful voice, grace, and confidence in interpreting vintage R&B and blues traditions[1][4]. Subsequent releases included the pop-oriented *Forbidden Tones* (1986) on Spindletop Records and a return to blues roots with *Read My Lips* (1989) on Antone's Records, featuring covers of Slim Harpo, Hank Ballard, and Wanda Jackson. She collaborated with Marcia Ball and Angela Strehli on *Dreams Come True* (1990) and continued performing, appearing on *Austin City Limits* in 1989 and 2001, at the 2006 Austin City Limits Festival, and touring with Jimmie Vaughan into the 2010s[1].

Barton's legacy endures in the Austin blues scene, where she dominated the Austin Music Awards in the 1980s, winning Female Vocalist of the Year three consecutive times, and was inducted into the Clifford Antone Foundation Hall of Fame[1][5]. She remains active, performing locally and occasionally touring[2].
