## Biography
King Curtis, born Curtis Ousley (originally Curtis Montgomery) on February 7, 1934 in Fort Worth, Texas, was a prodigious saxophonist whose career spanned jazz, blues, rhythm and blues, soul, rock and roll, and funk. Adopted as a child, Curtis grew up in a musical household and began playing saxophone at age twelve, inspired by his father's church band and the legendary tenor saxophonist Lester Young. He attended I.M. Terrell High School, a hub for Black musical talent, where he performed alongside future jazz great Ornette Coleman and was mentored by music teacher G.A. Baxter[1][2].

Curtis declined college scholarships to join Lionel Hampton's band, gaining experience as a performer, arranger, and multi-instrumentalist before moving to New York City in 1952. There, he became one of the most sought-after session musicians, contributing to hits by The Coasters ('Yakety Yak'), Buddy Holly, Aretha Franklin, and many others. His own recordings, such as 'Soul Twist,' 'Soul Serenade,' and 'Memphis Soul Stew,' showcased his distinctive, syncopated saxophone style, blending jazz improvisation with the big beat of R&B and soul[1][3]. Curtis led the Kingpins, a renowned backing band that supported Aretha Franklin and even opened for The Beatles at Shea Stadium in 1965. He was also a prolific producer and arranger, working with Jerry Wexler at Atlantic Records and collaborating with artists like Jimi Hendrix and John Lennon[1][2][3].

Curtis's legacy is profound: he shaped the sound of American soul, influenced generations of saxophonists, and bridged genres with his versatility. His tragic death in 1971 at age 37 cut short a vibrant career, but his impact endures in the work of artists he inspired and the recordings that remain staples of soul and R&B history[1][2][3].
