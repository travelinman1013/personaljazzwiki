## Biography
Booker T. Jones, born November 12, 1944, in Memphis, Tennessee, is an American multi-instrumentalist, songwriter, producer, and arranger, best known as the frontman of the instrumental soul group Booker T. & the M.G.'s[2][4]. From an early age, Jones was immersed in music, playing organ in church and various horns in his high school band, and by his mid-teens, he was already a working musician[1][2]. His professional career began in earnest when he started playing sessions at Satellite Records (later Stax Records), where he quickly became a regular fixture in the studio, contributing to recordings for artists like Rufus and Carla Thomas while still in high school[4].

In 1962, Jones, along with guitarist Steve Cropper, drummer Al Jackson Jr., and bassist Lewie Steinberg (later replaced by Donald 'Duck' Dunn), formed Booker T. & the M.G.'s, Stax Records’ pioneering house band[1][3]. Their debut single, 'Green Onions,' became an international hit and is now considered one of the greatest instrumental tracks in music history[2][4]. Jones’s leadership and innovative use of the Hammond B3 organ helped define the Memphis soul sound, influencing countless artists and shaping the direction of R&B and rock music. After briefly leaving Stax to earn a music degree from Indiana University, Jones returned to the label, further elevating its musical output and collaborating with a who’s who of soul and blues legends[1]. Over his long career, Jones has continued to push musical boundaries, working across genres and generations, and remains a revered figure in American music[2][5].

## Fun Facts
- Booker T. Jones was only 17 years old when 'Green Onions' became a hit, making him one of the youngest bandleaders to top the charts[2][4].
- Despite the racial tensions of the era, Booker T. & the M.G.'s was one of the first racially integrated bands in the American South, with both Black and white members[2].
- Jones temporarily left Stax Records to attend Indiana University, where he earned a degree in music, returning to the label with formal training that influenced the sophistication of later Stax recordings[1].
- He is considered one of the most famous Hammond B3 organ players in history and was a key architect of the Memphis soul sound[5].
