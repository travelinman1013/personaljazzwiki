## Biography
William Henry Joseph Bonaparte Bertholf Smith, known as Willie 'the Lion' Smith, was born on November 23, 1893, in Newark, New Jersey, and became one of the most influential stride pianists in jazz history.[5] Smith discovered his musical talent early, learning piano from his mother at age six after finding a deteriorated organ in his home's basement.[5] By age twelve, he had mastered ragtime pieces and began performing in Newark bars and saloons, eventually earning his first steady gig at Bill Buss's saloon.[3] His early career was shaped by encounters with other Newark-based pianists Charles 'Luckey' Roberts and James P. Johnson, all of whom pioneered the stride piano style—a sophisticated ragtime improvisation technique that would define their legacies.[3]

After serving as an artilleryman in World War I, Smith returned to Harlem and established himself as one of the 'Big Three' stride pianists alongside James P. Johnson and Fats Waller.[1][2] During the 1920s and beyond, Smith became a central figure in Harlem's jazz scene, performing regularly in clubs and at rent parties where pianists would compete to showcase their virtuosity.[2] Though he emerged on recordings relatively late compared to his contemporaries, beginning in 1933-35, Smith made up for lost time with his landmark 1939 Commodore recordings, where he recorded fourteen songs in a single day, including definitive versions of his compositions 'Echoes of Spring,' 'Fingerbuster,' and 'Morning Air.'[2] Throughout the 1940s-1970s, Smith maintained an active career touring North America and Europe, recording extensively in Paris and Germany, and continuing to perform as a solo pianist and bandleader well into his seventies.[2][3] He passed away in New York City on April 18, 1973, at age 79, leaving behind a profound influence on jazz piano and a legacy as one of stride piano's greatest masters.[3]

## Fun Facts
- Smith's birth date was a lifelong source of confusion and debate. He consistently claimed to have been born in 1897, but his WWI draft registration indicated 1893. Later, when he needed a birth certificate to travel to Europe in the 1940s, he discovered the Orange County Courthouse document stated November 25, contradicting what his mother had told him (November 23).[5]
- The origin of his nickname 'The Lion' is disputed. Smith always claimed he earned it for his bravery as an artilleryman in World War I, though the exact circumstances remain subject to debate.[1]
- Smith was a Hebrew cantor for a Black Jewish congregation in Harlem later in his life, and was Bar-Mitzvahed in Newark at age thirteen, adding a unique spiritual dimension to his multifaceted career.[4]
- Smith recorded his landmark 1939 Commodore debut as a solo pianist on January 10, 1939, laying down 14 songs in a single day—finally achieving the solo recording success that had eluded him for decades while his contemporaries James P. Johnson and Fats Waller had already recorded numerous classic performances.[2]
