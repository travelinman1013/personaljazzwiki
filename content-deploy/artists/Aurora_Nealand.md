## Biography
Aurora Nealand is a New Orleans–based sound artist, composer, and multi‑instrumentalist best known as a bandleader on the city’s vibrant traditional and experimental jazz scenes. Born on May 28 in California, she spent her early years in Pacifica, California, and later Colorado, growing up in an eccentric, highly musical household where her mother played classical piano and her father balanced archival work with rehearsals in rock bands.[1][2][3] She absorbed a wide spectrum of music at home—from Preservation Hall Jazz Band and Stravinsky to Joan Baez and the Pixies—which later fed into her genre‑blending approach.[1][2][3] Despite this musical environment, she had relatively little formal training until college, instead teaching herself and experimenting, and ultimately earning a degree in music composition from Oberlin Conservatory before continuing her studies in physical theatre at the Jacques Lecoq School in Paris.[1][2][3] After college she undertook a cross‑country bicycle trip, recording interviews and stories in rural America to use in compositions about “true American Dreams,” a project that reflected her interest in sound as a vehicle for storytelling.[1]

That bicycle journey brought Nealand to New Orleans around 2004, where she immersed herself in the city’s street and club culture and began learning traditional jazz, manouche jazz in the style of Django Reinhardt, and Balkan/Klezmer music directly from local players.[1][3] She cut her teeth as a sideman with groups such as Panorama Jazz Band, VaVaVoom, The New Orleans Moonshiners, and the women’s band Some Like It Hot, while also appearing in improvisation‑oriented settings like the Open Ears series.[1][3] In 2010 she formed her own non‑traditional traditional jazz band, The Royal Roses, whose collective improvisation draws from early New Orleans jazz, the AACM, collage‑sound art, and musique concrète; their debut album, “A Tribute to Sidney Bechet: Live at Preservation Hall,” earned national attention, and she was named one of DownBeat Magazine’s top rising stars on soprano saxophone that same year.[1][5] Alongside The Royal Roses, she leads or co‑leads projects such as The Monocle Ensemble (her original‑music and installation ensemble), Rory Danger and the Danger Dangers (a theatrical rockabilly outfit), The Inquiry Quintet, redrawblak Trio, and Instigation Orchestra, while also performing with groups like John Hollenbeck’s GEORGE and various Jazz at Lincoln Center educational initiatives.[1][4][5]

Nealand’s musical style spans traditional New Orleans jazz, free improvisation, rockabilly, sound installation, and experimental sound art, unified by a focus on narrative, collective improvisation, and the “sonification of everyday objects” as carriers of memory and history.[1][5] She frequently incorporates theatrical elements and alter egos into her performances—most notably the persona of Rory Danger—and develops fully staged works such as “KindHumanKind,” a 90‑minute theatrical show based on her original music that premiered at the Contemporary Arts Center New Orleans in 2019–2020.[5] As a performer and educator, she has appeared at major festivals and venues including the Montreal, Copenhagen, Istanbul, and New Orleans Jazz & Heritage festivals, Big Ears, Lincoln Center, the Kennedy Center, and SummerStage NYC, and she has long been involved with programs like the Walden School for Young Composers and Found Sound Nation.[1][4][5][8][9] Through these activities, as well as her contributions to post‑Katrina New Orleans and her visibility as a female bandleader and soprano saxophonist, Nealand has become a central figure in both preserving and reimagining the city’s jazz traditions for younger generations.[1][3][5]

## Fun Facts
- Before settling in New Orleans, Nealand rode a bicycle across the United States, collecting audio interviews and stories from people in rural America to turn into compositions about “true American Dreams.”[1]
- Early in her New Orleans days she would bike about seven miles every night from uptown to Frenchmen Street just to listen to bands like the Jazz Vipers at the Spotted Cat, staying late to talk with the musicians and learn from them.[3]
- She sometimes performs solo with a gas mask and accordion, and has been known to play saxophone and clarinet “duets with herself,” highlighting her flair for theatrical, visually striking performances.[7]
- Under her rockabilly alter ego Rory Danger, she fronts the band Rory Danger and the Danger Dangers, blurring the lines between concert, performance art, and tongue‑in‑cheek character work.[1][5]
