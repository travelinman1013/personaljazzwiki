## Biography
Jelly Roll Morton's Red Hot Peppers were a pioneering jazz ensemble led by Ferdinand 'Jelly Roll' Morton, one of the earliest and most influential figures in jazz. Morton, born Ferdinand Joseph Lamothe in New Orleans, Louisiana, in 1890 (some sources cite 1885), grew up in a Creole family opposed to his musical ambitions. He began playing piano in New Orleans' Storyville district, blending ragtime, minstrelsy, and dance rhythms to help shape the emerging jazz genre[2][3].

After touring the United States as a musician and entertainer, Morton settled in Chicago in the early 1920s. In 1926, he formed the Red Hot Peppers, assembling top New Orleans-style freelance musicians. The group, typically seven or eight members, recorded for Victor and produced landmark tracks such as "Black Bottom Stomp," "Smoke-House Blues," and "Doctor Jazz." Morton's sophisticated arrangements balanced ensemble interplay with individual solos, setting a new standard for small group jazz and establishing the Red Hot Peppers as a model for future jazz bands[1][2].

Morton's move to New York in 1928 marked the end of the Red Hot Peppers' classic period, though he continued recording under the name with various musicians. The band's recordings were crucial to the race records industry of the 1920s and 1930s and showcased Morton's mastery as a composer and arranger. Their blend of composition and improvisation influenced the development of swing and left a lasting legacy on jazz, even as Morton's style came to be viewed as old-fashioned in later years[1][2].
