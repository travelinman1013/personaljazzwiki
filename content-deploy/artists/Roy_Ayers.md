## Biography
Roy Ayers, born September 10, 1940, in Los Angeles, California, grew up in a musically gifted family—his mother was a piano teacher and his father a trombone player. Ayers’ lifelong connection to the vibraphone began at age six after attending a Lionel Hampton concert, where Hampton handed him a pair of mallets, inspiring his musical journey[1][4][5]. By his late teens, Ayers was active in the Los Angeles jazz scene, performing with local legends like Teddy Edwards and Chico Hamilton, and released his debut album, 'West Coast Vibes,' in 1963[1][3].

Ayers’ career accelerated when he joined flutist Herbie Mann’s band in 1966, touring and recording with Mann for four years, including on the influential album 'Memphis Underground.' After leaving Mann’s group in 1970, Ayers formed his own band, Ubiquity, which featured a rotating cast of musicians and fused jazz, funk, soul, rock, and Latin influences. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Ayers became a leading figure in jazz-funk and R&B, releasing classics like 'He’s Coming,' 'Vibrations,' and the iconic 'Everybody Loves the Sunshine,' which became a Southern California anthem and a staple for hip-hop sampling[1][2][4].

Ayers’ innovative use of effects on the vibraphone and his open-minded approach to genre blending made him a pioneer of acid jazz and neo-soul. His music has been sampled by artists such as Dr. Dre, Mary J. Blige, J Dilla, and 2Pac, cementing his legacy as a foundational influence in contemporary R&B, hip-hop, and soul. Ayers continued performing and collaborating with younger artists until his passing in 2025, remaining eternally relevant and celebrated as the 'Godfather of Neo-Soul'[2][4].
