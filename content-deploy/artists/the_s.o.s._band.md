## Biography
The S.O.S. Band, an American R&B and electro-funk group known as Sounds of Success, formed in Atlanta, Georgia, in 1977 as Santa Monica, inspired by a memorable performance there. Original members included lead vocalist Mary Davis, keyboardist Jason Bryant, saxophonists Billy Ellis and Willie 'Sonny' Killebrew, guitarist Bruno Speight, bassist John Simpson, and drummer James Earl Jones III. Managed by Bunny Jackson-Ransom, they sent a demo to Clarence Avant of Tabu Records, who signed them and paired them with producer Sigidi Abdullah, who renamed them The S.O.S. Band. Their 1980 self-titled debut album, produced by Abdullah, went gold, driven by the platinum single 'Take Your Time (Do It Right),' which topped the R&B chart and reached No. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100.[1][2][3]

The group evolved with key collaborations, including trumpeter/percussionist Abdul Ra'oof joining during their world tour, and producers Leon Sylvers III, Jimmy Jam, and Terry Lewis on later albums. Hits like 'Just Be Good to Me' and 'Tell Me If You Still Care' from the 1983 gold album *On the Rise* defined their post-disco, quiet storm, and funk sound, blending smooth vocals, strong rhythms, and electronic elements like the Roland TR-808. Mary Davis left in 1986 for a solo career; Chandra Currelley and Fredi Grace took over vocals for albums like *Diamonds in the Raw* (1989). Saxophonist Billy Ellis died during its recording. Davis rejoined in 1994.[1][4]

Their legacy endures as 1980s R&B pioneers alongside Michael Jackson and Prince, with enduring hits like 'The Finest' from *Sands of Time* (1986). They received a 2012 achievement award at the Georgia Music Awards, maintaining popularity in genres like post-disco and funk.[1][4]
