## Biography
Naomi Shelton & the Gospel Queens are a Brooklyn-based gospel and soul group fronted by the powerful vocalist Naomi Shelton, born Naomi Davis on October 14, 1942, in Midway, Alabama. Shelton’s musical journey began in her childhood, singing in her Baptist church and performing on the radio with her siblings as the Davis Sisters. After graduating high school in 1958, she moved to Florida, where she was influenced by both gospel and secular soul music, before settling in Brooklyn, New York, in 1963. There, she became a fixture on the club scene, notably as a house singer at the Nite Cap club, and forged a partnership with pianist Cliff Driver, who would become her long-time musical director.

Despite a career spanning over four decades, Shelton did not release her first full-length album until 2009, when Daptone Records issued 'What Have You Done, My Brother?' to critical acclaim, followed by 'Cold World' in 2014. The group’s sound is rooted in classic gospel, soul, and blues, characterized by Shelton’s gritty contralto and the Queens’ rich harmonies, blending vintage soul with a deeply spiritual message. Their music, described as 'timeless funk and blues-tinged soul,' has earned them a reputation as one of the hardest working live acts, with performances at major festivals and venues in the US and Europe. Shelton’s legacy endures as a bridge between the sacred and the secular, bringing gospel fire and heartfelt authenticity to contemporary soul music.
