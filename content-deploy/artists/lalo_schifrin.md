## Biography
Boris Claudio "Lalo" Schifrin was born on June 21, 1932, in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and became one of the most prolific and versatile composers of the 20th century[1]. Though he initially studied sociology and law at the University of Buenos Aires, his passion for music led him to pursue a scholarship to the Conservatoire de Paris at age 20, where he studied under the legendary composers Olivier Messiaen and Charles Koechlin[1][4]. During his time in Paris from 1952 onward, Schifrin balanced formal classical training with his love of jazz, performing in Parisian jazz clubs at night and representing Argentina at the International Jazz Festival in 1955[1][4]. In 1955, he played piano with the renowned bandoneon player Ástor Piazzolla, further developing his unique blend of classical, jazz, and Latin American musical elements[1].

Returning to Argentina in the mid-1950s, Schifrin formed Latin America's first jazz orchestra, a 16-piece big band that became a fixture on Buenos Aires television[1][7]. A pivotal moment came in 1956 when he met jazz legend Dizzy Gillespie, who invited him to become his pianist and arranger after hearing him perform[1][5]. Schifrin moved to the United States in 1958 and worked with Gillespie from 1960 to 1962, composing major works including the Grammy-nominated "Gillespiana" (1960) and "The New Continent" (1962)[1][3]. During this period, he also signed with Verve Records in 1962 and won his first Grammy Award in 1965 for arranging "The Cat" for organist Jimmy Smith[3].

Schifrin's film and television career became his defining legacy, with over 180 credits to his name[6]. He achieved international recognition through his iconic "Theme from Mission: Impossible" (1966) and scores for acclaimed films including "Cool Hand Luke" (1967), "Bullitt," "Enter the Dragon" (1973), and the "Dirty Harry" film series[2][6]. His compositional style synthesized traditional orchestration with jazz and Latin American elements, creating a distinctive sound that influenced generations of film composers[3]. Beyond film work, Schifrin maintained an active classical composition career with over 60 works, and from 1993 onward, he pioneered the "Jazz Meets the Symphony" series with the London Philharmonic Orchestra, featuring collaborations with jazz luminaries[5][6]. Over his lifetime, Schifrin received five Grammy Awards, six Oscar nominations, and one Latin Grammy Award[2][5]. He passed away on June 26, 2025, leaving behind an unparalleled legacy spanning jazz, classical, and film music[1].
