## Biography
Toots & the Maytals are one of the foundational groups in Jamaican popular music, helping shape ska, rocksteady, and reggae into globally recognized styles. Formed in Kingston, Jamaica in 1962 as **The Maytals**, the original vocal trio featured Frederick “Toots” Hibbert alongside Henry “Raleigh” Gordon and Nathaniel “Jerry” Mathias/McCarthy, drawing on Toots’s church-trained gospel voice and close-harmony singing.[1][2][4] They first recorded at Clement “Coxsone” Dodd’s Studio One, scoring early Jamaican hits such as “Hallelujah,” “I’ll Never Grow Old,” and the gospel-inflected “Six and Seven Books of Moses,” and briefly used names like The Vikings and The Flames on early releases.[1][3][4] After leaving Studio One, they cut key ska sides for producer Prince Buster and then, with Byron Lee and the Dragonaires, won the inaugural Jamaican Independence Festival Popular Song Competition in 1966 with “Bam Bam,” cementing their status at the forefront of the island’s new sound.[1][2][4]

Their rise paused when Toots was jailed in the mid‑1960s on a marijuana charge, later immortalized in the song “54‑46 Was My Number,” but on his release in 1967 the group re-formed and evolved into **Toots & the Maytals**, teaming with producer Leslie Kong for a run of late‑1960s and early‑1970s classics.[1][2][4] The single “Do the Reggay” (1968) is widely credited with coining the word *reggae*, while songs like “Monkey Man,” “Pressure Drop,” “Sweet and Dandy,” and “54‑46 Was My Number” helped define the new genre.[2][4][6] Signing with Chris Blackwell’s Island Records in the early 1970s, they released internationally influential albums such as *Funky Kingston* (1973) and *Reggae Got Soul* (1975/76), showcasing a sound that fused Jamaican rhythms with American soul, R&B, and rock, and brought them tours across the UK, Europe, and the US.[1][2][4] Toots’s gritty, Otis Redding–like vocal delivery and the band’s tight, gospel-charged arrangements made them peers of Bob Marley in bringing reggae to international audiences, and their songs have been widely covered and sampled, leaving a lasting imprint on ska, roots reggae, punk, and rock.[2][4][6]

Even as line‑ups evolved—adding key instrumentalists like bassist Jackie Jackson, guitarist Hux Brown/Rad Bryan, and drummer Paul Douglas—Toots & the Maytals maintained a distinctive blend of **gospel, ska, soul, reggae, and rock**, built around call‑and‑response vocals, uplifting choruses, and socially aware yet deeply spiritual lyrics.[1][2][4] Their music featured prominently in the 1972 film *The Harder They Come* with tracks such as “Sweet and Dandy” and “Pressure Drop,” further amplifying their global reach.[2][4] Frontman Toots Hibert continued to record and tour under the Toots & the Maytals name into the 21st century, earning a Grammy Award for Best Reggae Album for *True Love* (2005) and additional acclaim for later work until his death in 2020, after which he has been remembered as a reggae pioneer whose influence rivals that of Jamaica’s most celebrated artists.[2][4][5]

## Fun Facts
- The 1968 single "Do the Reggay" by Toots & the Maytals is widely credited with introducing and naming the genre "reggae," helping define the term that would soon describe Jamaica’s signature music style.[2][4][6]
- Toots Hibbert’s arrest and 18‑month imprisonment on a marijuana charge in the 1960s directly inspired the classic song "54‑46 Was My Number," which refers to his prison identification number.[1][4]
- The group twice won Jamaica’s national song competition in its early years: first with "Bam Bam" in the inaugural Jamaican Independence Festival Popular Song Contest in 1966, and again with "Sweet and Dandy" in 1969.[2][4]
- Toots’s powerful, gospel-drenched voice was frequently compared to American soul legend Otis Redding, underscoring how deeply soul and R&B influenced the band’s reggae and ska sound.[2][4]
