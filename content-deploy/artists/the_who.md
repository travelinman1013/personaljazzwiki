## Biography
The Who are an English rock band formed in London in 1964, originally emerging from an earlier group called The Detours. The classic lineup consisted of lead vocalist Roger Daltrey, guitarist and songwriter Pete Townshend, bassist John Entwistle, and drummer Keith Moon. Their early years were marked by a rebellious energy and association with the British 'mod' subculture, and they quickly gained notoriety for their aggressive sound, innovative use of feedback and power chords, and their theatrical stage antics, which often included the destruction of instruments. Their first single as The Who, 'I Can't Explain' (1965), reached the UK top ten, followed by a string of hits like 'My Generation' and 'Substitute' that established them as leaders of the British Invasion alongside the Beatles and the Rolling Stones.

Throughout the late 1960s and 1970s, The Who pushed musical boundaries, pioneering the use of synthesizers in rock and developing the concept of the rock opera, most notably with their landmark albums 'Tommy' (1969) and 'Quadrophenia' (1973). Their live performances became legendary for their intensity and innovation, and they played iconic sets at festivals such as Monterey Pop and Woodstock. Despite the tragic deaths of Keith Moon in 1978 and John Entwistle in 2002, The Who continued to perform and record, with Townshend and Daltrey carrying the band's legacy into the 21st century. The Who have sold over 100 million records worldwide and are widely regarded as one of the most influential rock bands of all time, shaping the sound and attitude of generations of musicians.
