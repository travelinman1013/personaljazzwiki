## Biography
Grupo Arembepe appears to be a misattribution or confusion with the culturally significant village of Arembepe, located on the north coast of Bahia, Brazil. While there is no verified musical group by the name 'Grupo Arembepe' with documented recordings or a recognized discography, Arembepe itself is renowned for its vibrant alternative culture, especially as the site of Brazil's most famous hippie village. During the late 1960s and 1970s, Arembepe attracted international musicians and artists, including Janis Joplin, Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, and the influential Brazilian group Novos Baianos, who drew inspiration from the area's laid-back lifestyle and communal spirit.[1][5]

The village has long been a hub for musical performances, fairs, and exhibitions, fostering a creative environment that blends traditional Bahian music with global influences. While no official group named 'Grupo Arembepe' is documented, the region's musical legacy is carried forward by local musicians, capoeiristas, and cultural leaders such as Mestre Lua de Bobó, a prominent Capoeira Angola master born in Arembepe in 1950. Mestre Lua founded the Grupo de Capoeira Angola Menino de Arembepe (GCAMA), which has played a key role in preserving and spreading Afro-Brazilian musical and cultural traditions.[2][4]

Arembepe's enduring legacy is its role as a meeting point for countercultural movements, environmental activism, and musical innovation. The village continues to inspire artists and musicians who visit or reside there, maintaining its reputation as a cradle of creativity and alternative culture on the Brazilian coast.[1]
