## Biography
Nnenna Freelon (born Chinyere Nnenna Pierce on July 28, 1954, in Cambridge, Massachusetts) is a celebrated American jazz vocalist, composer, producer, arranger, actress, and playwright. Raised in a musically supportive family, Freelon began singing in her community and church choirs at Union Baptist Church and St. Paul AME in Cambridge. She graduated from Simmons College in Boston with a degree in health care administration and initially worked in hospital administration before pursuing music professionally in her late thirties.[2][1][6]

Freelon's career took a pivotal turn in 1990 when she met Ellis Marsalis at a Southern Arts Federation jazz meeting, leading to her signing with Columbia Records and the release of her debut album in 1992. Over the decades, she has recorded numerous acclaimed albums, earning seven Grammy nominations, and has performed at prestigious venues such as Carnegie Hall, the Apollo Theater, and the Hollywood Bowl. Her musical style is rooted in vocal jazz, blending soulful storytelling with technical virtuosity, and she is renowned for her emotionally resonant performances and commitment to arts education and advocacy.[2][3][4]

Freelon’s legacy extends beyond performance: she is a tireless educator, arts advocate, and mentor, known for her master classes and workshops. Her influence is felt in the jazz community and beyond, inspiring younger musicians and collaborating with legends such as Ray Charles, Herbie Hancock, and Aretha Franklin. Her recent work, including the deeply personal 'Time Traveler' and 'Beneath the Skin,' reflects her journey through grief and resilience, further cementing her place as a transformative figure in contemporary jazz.[2][4][5]
