## Biography
Cyrus Chestnut, born January 17, 1963, in Baltimore, Maryland, is a celebrated jazz pianist renowned for his soulful blend of jazz, gospel, and bop influences. Raised in a musically rich household—his father was a church organist and his mother a choir director—Chestnut began playing piano at age three and was performing in church by age seven. By nine, he was studying classical music at the Peabody Preparatory Institute, and his early exposure to both gospel and jazz, including artists like Thelonious Monk and Jimmy Smith, profoundly shaped his musical voice[2][1].

Chestnut attended the Baltimore School for the Arts before enrolling at Berklee College of Music in 1981, where he earned a degree in jazz composition and arranging in 1985. At Berklee, he was recognized with several prestigious awards, including the Eubie Blake Fellowship and scholarships named for Oscar Peterson and Quincy Jones. After graduation, Chestnut honed his craft as a sideman with jazz luminaries such as Jon Hendricks, Terence Blanchard, Donald Harrison, and Wynton Marsalis, and he gained invaluable experience touring with the legendary vocalist Betty Carter[1][2][3].

As a bandleader, Chestnut has released numerous acclaimed albums, including 'Revelation' (1994), 'The Dark Before The Dawn' (1995), and 'Cyrus Chestnut' (1998), featuring collaborations with Anita Baker, James Carter, and Ron Carter. His improvisational prowess and deep roots in gospel have made him a sought-after pianist for big bands and orchestras, and he continues to inspire audiences and students worldwide through his performances and educational work[1][3].
