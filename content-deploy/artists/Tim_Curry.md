## Biography
Timothy James Curry, born on April 19, 1946 in Grappenhall, Cheshire, England, is a celebrated English actor and singer whose career spans stage, screen, and music. Raised by a school secretary mother and a Methodist Royal Navy chaplain father, Curry showed early musical promise as a boy soprano singing in church from age six. He studied Drama and English at Birmingham University, graduating with Combined Honors, and soon launched his professional career in the London production of 'Hair.'

Curry's breakthrough came with his iconic portrayal of Dr. Frank-N-Furter in 'The Rocky Horror Show,' a role he originated on stage and immortalized in the cult film 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show' (1975). His stage work includes acclaimed performances in 'Travesties,' 'Amadeus,' 'The Pirates of Penzance,' and 'Spamalot,' earning him multiple Tony and Olivier Award nominations. Parallel to his acting success, Curry pursued music, releasing three solo rock albums—'Read My Lips' (1978), 'Fearless' (1979), and 'Simplicity' (1981)—with collaborators like Bob Ezrin and Dick Wagner. His musical style blends rock, pop, and theatrical influences, with a penchant for eclectic covers and original compositions.

Curry's legacy is defined by his versatility and charisma, influencing generations of performers in musical theatre and beyond. His distinctive voice and flamboyant stage presence have made him a sought-after figure in film, television, and voice acting, with memorable roles in 'Annie,' 'Clue,' 'It,' and 'Muppet Treasure Island.' Despite health challenges later in life, Curry remains a beloved figure whose work continues to inspire artists and audiences worldwide.
