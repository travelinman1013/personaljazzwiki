## Biography
Huntertones is a dynamic American jazz-funk group known for their high-energy, horn-driven sound and genre-blending compositions. The band was formed in 2010 at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio, by saxophonist Dan White, trombonist Chris Ott, and trumpeter/sousaphone player Jon Lampley. Originally named the Dan White Sextet, the group began by performing house shows on Hunter Avenue, which later inspired their current name. Their early years were marked by a collaborative spirit and a deep engagement with jazz tradition, particularly through their experience playing the music of Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers in college ensemble classes[2][3][4][9].

After relocating to Brooklyn, New York, in 2014, Huntertones expanded their lineup and musical horizons, embracing influences from funk, soul, hip hop, gospel, and rock. Their discography includes both studio and live albums, such as 'Passport' (2018), which reflects the impact of their international travels through the U.S. State Department’s American Music Abroad program. The band has performed in over 25 countries, sharing the stage with acclaimed artists and appearing at major festivals. Their music is celebrated for its technical virtuosity, infectious energy, and commitment to community, both within the band and with audiences worldwide[2][3][4][6].

Huntertones' legacy lies in their fearless approach to genre, their collaborative ethos, and their role as cultural ambassadors for American music. Their live performances are renowned for their celebratory atmosphere and ability to connect across language and cultural barriers. As individual members pursue successful careers in New York, including television and touring work, Huntertones continues to evolve, inspiring new generations of musicians with their innovative sound and dedication to musical excellence[3][4][6].
