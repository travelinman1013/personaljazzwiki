## Biography
Neville Jacobs is a collaborative musical project formed by Ivan Neville, a New Orleans funk legend and scion of the famed Neville family, and Cris Jacobs, a Baltimore-born singer-songwriter and guitarist known for his roots-rock and soulful style.

Their debut album, released in 2023, showcases their chemistry and mutual respect, with songs that reflect both personal and collective journeys. The project is notable for its organic collaboration, with both artists contributing vocals, songwriting, and instrumental work, resulting in a sound that is both fresh and deeply rooted in tradition.

Musically, Neville Jacobs draws from Ivan Neville’s rich heritage in New Orleans funk—his father is Aaron Neville and his uncles include Art, Charles, and Cyril Neville of the Neville Brothers and The Meters—as well as Cris Jacobs’ experience leading the band The Bridge and his solo career. Their style is characterized by soulful melodies, groove-driven rhythms, and heartfelt lyrics, creating a sound that is both contemporary and timeless. The group has been praised for its ability to bridge genres and generations, offering a new chapter in the legacy of New Orleans music while also highlighting Jacobs’ songwriting prowess.
