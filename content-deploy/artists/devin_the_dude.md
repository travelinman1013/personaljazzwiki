## Biography
Devin Copeland, known as Devin the Dude, was born on June 4, 1970, in Pontiac, Michigan, though sources also note St. Petersburg, Florida as a birthplace; he spent his early years moving between New Boston, Florida, and Houston, Texas, where he settled after high school and became immersed in the local hip-hop scene.[2][4][6] As a child, he collected discarded records from a nearby radio station, sparking his love for music, and later discovered hip-hop, performing as a pop-locker for friends, family, and at a nursing home.[1] In the late 1980s, he formed the Odd Squad (later Coughee Brothaz) with Rob Quest, Jugg Mugg, and DJ Screw (later DJ Styles), signing to Rap-A-Lot Records in 1992 and releasing their debut album Fadanuf Fa Erybody!! in 1994, praised for its effort but not commercially successful.[3][4][5]

Devin advanced his career joining Scarface's Facemob for their 1996 album The Other Side of the Law before launching solo with The Dude in 1998, inspired by Quincy Jones' album of the same name; it earned a rare 4-mic rating from The Source and built a cult following with its funk-laden, laid-back style centered on weed, women, wine, and storytelling.[1][2][4] His feature on Dr. Dre's 'Fuck You' from 2001 elevated his profile, leading to collaborations across hip-hop eras and solo albums like Just Tryin’ ta Live (2002), Waiting to Inhale (2007, his first Top 40 Billboard entry), Suite #420 (2010), One for the Road (2013), and later works such as Acoustic Levitation (2017).[2][4] Known for his hazy, spacey flow and g-funk/southern hip-hop sound, Devin has released multiple critically acclaimed albums, becoming a respected underground figure and 'your favorite rapper's favorite rapper.'[1][2][4]

His legacy endures as a consistent, amiable artist with deep Houston ties, influencing Southern rap through raw storytelling without mainstream commercial peaks, maintaining a dedicated fanbase via albums into the 2020s like Still Rollin’ Up (2019) and Soulful Distance (2021).[3][4]
