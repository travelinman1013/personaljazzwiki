## Biography
The Fat Babies are a Chicago-based jazz ensemble founded in 2010 by string bass player Beau Sample. The group formed with the mission of authentically interpreting and reviving the classic jazz styles of the 1920s and 1930s, a period often referred to as the golden age of jazz. Over the years, the band has grown to include eight members, each a consummate musician with deep roots in both local and international jazz scenes. Their lineup has featured Andy Schumm (cornet), Paul Asaro (piano and vocals), Dave Bock (trombone), Alex Hall (drums), Johnny Donatowicz (banjo/guitar), John Otto (clarinet/alto sax), and Jake Sanders (banjo/guitar), among others.

The Fat Babies quickly established themselves as one of the leading traditional jazz bands in the United States, regularly performing at Chicago venues and gaining national and international recognition. Their discography includes several albums released on the prestigious Delmark label, such as 'Solid Gassuh' and 'Uptown,' which showcase their dedication to historically accurate arrangements and vibrant ensemble playing. The band is known for its meticulous approach to period authenticity, from their choice of repertoire to their instrumentation and arrangements, often drawing on rare and obscure jazz compositions alongside well-known classics. Their performances evoke the emotional vitality and danceable joy of early jazz, appealing to both seasoned aficionados and younger audiences.

While firmly rooted in tradition, The Fat Babies are not mere imitators; they bring fresh energy and inventive musicianship to their interpretations, often creating original arrangements and compositions that seamlessly blend with vintage material. Their legacy lies in their role as cultural custodians, keeping the spirit of early jazz alive and relevant in the modern era, and inspiring a new generation of musicians and listeners to appreciate the enduring charm of ragtime and swing.
