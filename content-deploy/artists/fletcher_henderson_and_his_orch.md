## Biography
Fletcher Henderson (James Fletcher Hamilton Henderson, December 18, 1897 – December 29, 1952) was a pioneering American pianist, bandleader, arranger, and composer, born in Cuthbert, Georgia. Raised in a middle-class African-American family, Henderson initially pursued chemistry at Atlanta University but turned to music for professional opportunities after facing racial barriers in his field. He began his career as a song demonstrator for Pace-Handy Music Corporation and soon became a house pianist for Black Swan Records, accompanying blues singers such as Ethel Waters and Lucille Hegamin[2][3].

In the early 1920s, Henderson formed one of the first big band orchestras in New York City, quickly attracting top musicians and soloists. His ensemble became the house band at the Roseland Ballroom, where he collaborated with arranger Don Redman and, notably, brought Louis Armstrong to New York in 1924. Henderson’s arrangements, which blended written scores with improvisatory jazz styles, were instrumental in bridging Dixieland and swing eras. By the 1930s, his orchestra was considered among the best African-American bands in New York, but financial difficulties during the Great Depression led to its dissolution. Henderson then became a key arranger for Benny Goodman, whose success in the swing era owed much to Henderson’s innovative charts[1][2][3].

Henderson’s musical style was characterized by sophisticated arrangements, strong ensemble playing, and the integration of hot jazz solos. His legacy includes not only his own recordings and performances but also his role in shaping the swing era and mentoring future jazz greats. He continued arranging and occasionally performing until a stroke in 1950 ended his career. Henderson died in New York City in 1952, leaving a lasting impact on jazz and big band music[1][3].
