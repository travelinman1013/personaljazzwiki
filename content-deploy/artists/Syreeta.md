## Biography
Syreeta Wright, born August 3, 1946, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, emerged as a distinctive voice and songwriter in the Motown era. Moving to Detroit as a young woman, she initially joined Motown Records as a receptionist in 1965, but her musical talent was soon recognized by Brian Holland, who began using her as a background vocalist and introduced her to Berry Gordy. Under the name Rita Wright, she released her first single, 'I Can't Give Back the Love I Feel For You,' in 1967, a song originally intended for Diana Ross. Syreeta's songwriting prowess quickly became apparent, leading her to collaborate with Stevie Wonder, with whom she co-wrote several Motown classics, including 'Signed, Sealed, Delivered, I'm Yours' and 'If You Really Love Me.'

Her creative and personal partnership with Stevie Wonder, whom she married in 1970, defined much of her early career. Together, they produced her critically acclaimed debut album 'Syreeta' (1972) and 'Stevie Wonder Presents Syreeta' (1974), both of which showcased her expressive, soulful vocals and a blend of Motown, soul, and funk influences. Even after their divorce, Syreeta continued to work with Wonder and other notable producers and artists, including Leon Ware, Richard Perry, and Jermaine Jackson. Her duet with Billy Preston, 'With You I'm Born Again,' became an international hit in 1979, cementing her status as a versatile and emotive performer.

Syreeta's musical style was marked by a gentle, nuanced vocal delivery and a willingness to explore lyrical themes ranging from love and spirituality to social consciousness. Though she never achieved the commercial heights of some Motown peers, her influence as a songwriter and collaborator is widely recognized, and she is remembered as one of the label's most talented and respected artists. Syreeta passed away on July 6, 2004, in Los Angeles, leaving behind a legacy of innovation and artistry within the soul and Motown genres.

## Fun Facts

- She started at Motown as a receptionist and secretary before being discovered for her singing talent.
- The cover of her 1977 album 'One To One' features a drawing instead of a photo because Motown felt the time it took to braid her hair was not cost-effective.
- Her international hit 'With You I'm Born Again' with Billy Preston was featured in the film 'Fast Break' (1979).
