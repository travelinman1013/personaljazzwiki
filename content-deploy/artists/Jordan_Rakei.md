## Biography
Jordan Rakei is a New Zealand-born, Australia-raised musician, celebrated for his soulful vocals, intricate production, and genre-blending artistry. Born in Tokoroa, New Zealand, on May 23, 1992, Rakei moved to Brisbane, Australia, where he developed his musical talents and released his first two EPs, 'Franklin’s Room' and 'Groove Curse,' by age 21[6][1][3]. His early work was characterized by a DIY, bedroom-produced aesthetic, drawing on influences from neo soul, jazz, and electronic music.

Seeking broader horizons, Rakei relocated to London in 2015, immersing himself in the city’s vibrant soul, jazz, and electronic scenes[2][7]. He quickly gained recognition for his debut album 'Cloak' (2016), followed by 'Wallflower' (2017), which showcased his evocative songwriting and willingness to experiment with stripped-back acoustic arrangements[1][7]. Rakei’s subsequent albums, including 'Origin' (2019) and 'What We Call Life' (2021), further cemented his reputation as a masterful producer and multi-instrumentalist, with themes ranging from technology’s impact on society to personal introspection[3][4]. His fifth album, 'The Loop' (2024), marks a new chapter, featuring bold orchestral arrangements and deeply personal narratives reflecting his journey through marriage and fatherhood[1][4][5].

Rakei’s musical style is rooted in indie soul and neo soul, with influences from Stevie Wonder, Bill Withers, Curtis Mayfield, and D’Angelo[1]. His ability to blend genres and collaborate with a diverse array of artists has made him a sought-after figure in contemporary music, earning him GRAMMY and Ivor Novello nominations. With over a billion streams and sold-out shows at venues like London’s Royal Albert Hall, Rakei’s legacy is defined by his innovation, emotional depth, and commitment to pushing musical boundaries[5][1].
