## Biography
John Allen Campbell (January 20, 1952 – June 13, 1993) was an American blues guitarist, singer, and songwriter, renowned for his raw, slide-heavy guitar style and deeply expressive vocals. Born in Shreveport, Louisiana, Campbell was exposed to music early, acquiring his first guitar at age eight and performing by thirteen. His musical journey was profoundly shaped by a serious drag racing accident in his teens, which left him with lasting injuries and a period of solitude that deepened his devotion to the blues, particularly the works of John Lee Hooker and Lightnin’ Hopkins.

Campbell began his career in Texas with the power trio Junction in the early 1970s, later moving through the blues circuits of New Orleans and East Texas. By the mid-1980s, he had relocated to New York City, where his talent quickly earned him opening slots for major blues acts and the attention of producer Ronnie Earl. Campbell's breakthrough came with the albums 'One Believer' (1991) and 'Howlin Mercy' (1993) on Elektra Records, which showcased his distinctive approach to modern blues and his mastery of both acoustic and resonator guitars. His music was marked by a dark, haunting quality, often drawing on Southern folklore and personal hardship.

Despite a tragically short career—he died of a heart attack in Manhattan at age 41—Campbell left a lasting impact on the blues revival of the early 1990s. His recordings are celebrated for their emotional intensity, innovative slide technique, and the way they bridged traditional Delta blues with contemporary sensibilities. Campbell’s legacy persists as a cult figure whose influence is felt among modern blues musicians.
