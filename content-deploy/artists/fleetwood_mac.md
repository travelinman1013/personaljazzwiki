## Biography
Fleetwood Mac is a British-American rock band founded in London in 1967 by guitarist Peter Green, drummer Mick Fleetwood, and bassist John McVie, all former members of John Mayall’s Bluesbreakers. Initially conceived as a hard-edged British blues combo, the band quickly found success during the late 1960s blues boom with their debut album and the instrumental hit “Albatross.” Over the next decade, Fleetwood Mac underwent numerous lineup changes, most notably with the addition of keyboardist Christine McVie in 1970 and, in 1974, the American duo of singer-songwriter Stevie Nicks and guitarist Lindsey Buckingham. This infusion of new talent shifted the band's sound from blues to a more polished pop/rock style, culminating in their 1975 self-titled album and the landmark 1977 release, 'Rumours.'

'Rumours' became one of the best-selling albums of all time, celebrated for its melodic songwriting, vocal harmonies, and emotionally charged lyrics that reflected the band members' personal turmoil and romantic breakups. The album won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year and has sold over 40 million copies worldwide, solidifying Fleetwood Mac's legacy as one of the most influential and enduring acts in rock history. The band's musical style evolved from blues to soft rock and pop, characterized by intricate vocal interplay, memorable hooks, and introspective lyrics. Despite frequent personnel changes, solo pursuits, and internal conflicts, Fleetwood Mac continued to record and tour, earning induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1998 and remaining a major force in popular music for over five decades.
