## Biography
Miss Sophie Lee Lowry is a jazz and swing vocalist, composer, and bandleader based in New Orleans, Louisiana. Born in Chicago to a racially mixed family—her mother is Korean and her father is Black, with roots in Mississippi and Tallulah, Louisiana—Lee grew up surrounded by a diverse musical and cultural heritage.

Lee's career began in earnest after she moved to New Orleans, where she became a fixture on Frenchmen Street, the city's vibrant hub for live jazz. She is known for her fresh interpretations of classic swing and jazz standards, drawing inspiration from legends like Billie Holiday while infusing her performances with her own conversational and playful style[3][9]. As a bandleader and composer, Lee has released original music and led ensembles that celebrate the rich traditions of New Orleans jazz, earning a reputation as one of the hardest-working musicians in the city[4].

Beyond her musical achievements, Lee is also recognized for her entrepreneurial spirit and community involvement. She balances her roles as a performer, businesswoman, mother, and wife, all while supporting local musicians and fostering the next generation of jazz artists[7]. Her legacy is one of resilience, creativity, and a deep commitment to the cultural life of New Orleans.
