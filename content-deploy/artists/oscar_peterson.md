## Biography
Oscar Emmanuel Peterson was born on August 15, 1925, in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, to immigrants from the West Indies who instilled in him a deep love of music. Growing up in the predominantly Black neighbourhood of Little Burgundy, Peterson was exposed to jazz culture from an early age. He began studying piano at age five under the tutelage of his father Daniel and sister Daisy, receiving classical training from Hungarian-born pianist Paul de Marky, a student of István Thomán who traced his lineage back to Franz Liszt himself. A bout of tuberculosis at age seven prevented him from pursuing trumpet, redirecting his focus entirely to piano. By age nine, Peterson demonstrated remarkable technical control that impressed professional musicians, and at fourteen, he won the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's national music competition. He became a professional pianist while still in high school, performing with the Johnny Holmes Orchestra and starring in weekly radio shows.

Peterson's international breakthrough came in 1949 when jazz impresario Norman Granz heard him performing live on radio from the Alberta Lounge in Montreal and was so impressed that he invited the 24-year-old to perform as a surprise guest at Jazz at the Philharmonic's Carnegie Hall performance on September 18, 1949. This pivotal moment launched Peterson onto the world stage, and he subsequently toured extensively with JATP, performing alongside legends including Ella Fitzgerald, Ray Eldridge, Lester Young, and Lionel Hampton. Throughout his career spanning more than 60 years, Peterson became renowned for his technical mastery, melodic inventiveness, and ability to seamlessly blend classical training with jazz improvisation. He earned the nickname "Maharaja of the Keyboard" from Duke Ellington and was informally known as "the King of inside swing" in the jazz community.

Peterson's prolific output included more than 500 recordings and numerous compositions, earning him eight Grammy Awards between 1975 and 1997, plus a lifetime achievement award from the Recording Academy. Beyond his performance career, he was a significant composer, creating works such as the Grammy-nominated "Canadiana Suite," the three-part "A Salute to Bach," the jazz ballet "City Lights," and the "Africa" suite. His contributions to music and humanitarian efforts earned him international recognition including the UNESCO International Music Prize, the Praemium Imperiale World Art Award, and sixteen honorary doctorates. Peterson remained a proud ambassador for Canada throughout his career, maintaining a grueling touring schedule of over 300 days per year until his death on December 23, 2007. Posthumously, he was inducted into the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame and Canadian Music Hall of Fame, and his legacy is commemorated through a statue in Canada's capital, a Canada Post stamp, and a commemorative circulation coin issued by the Royal Canadian Mint.

## Fun Facts
- Peterson was called 'the Brown Bomber of the Boogie-Woogie' as a child due to his exceptional skill in that style, and he maintained a rigorous practice schedule of four to six hours daily for many years, only reducing it to one or two hours in his later years.
- Norman Granz discovered Peterson in one of the most serendipitous moments in jazz history: while taking a taxi to the Montreal airport in 1949, Granz heard Peterson's live broadcast from the Alberta Lounge on the radio and asked the cab driver to turn around and take him to the club instead of the airport.
- Peterson was the first Canadian and the first jazz musician to receive the UNESCO International Music Prize, which he received in 2000, reflecting the global recognition of his contributions to music.
- Despite maintaining a grueling touring schedule of over 300 days per year throughout most of his career, Peterson was also a prolific composer who created numerous major works including ballets and suites, demonstrating his versatility beyond performance.
