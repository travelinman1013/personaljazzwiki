## Biography
George Benson, born March 22, 1943, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, emerged from humble beginnings as a child prodigy in the Hill District. Raised by a single mother, he began performing publicly at age seven, playing ukulele in local drugstores and later guitar in nightclubs. By age ten, he had recorded his first single with RCA Victor under the name 'Little George.'

Benson's early career was shaped by his work with organist Jack McDuff, where he honed his jazz guitar skills and developed a reputation for his dynamic sense of swing and technical agility. Influenced by jazz greats such as Wes Montgomery, Benson soon launched a solo career, blending jazz, pop, R&B, and scat singing. His 1976 album 'Breezin'' became a triple-platinum hit, and his vocal performance on 'This Masquerade' earned him the Grammy for Record of the Year. Over the decades, Benson has won ten Grammy Awards and is celebrated for his unique ability to play and sing melodic lines in unison, as well as for his rest-stroke picking technique reminiscent of gypsy jazz.

Benson's legacy extends beyond his chart-topping albums and sold-out concerts. He is recognized as one of the greatest jazz guitarists, bridging genres and influencing generations of musicians. His innovative style and crossover appeal have made him a major figure in both jazz and popular music, earning him a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and the title of NEA Jazz Master.
