## Biography
Pink Floyd are an English rock band formed in London in 1965 by Syd Barrett (guitar, vocals), Nick Mason (drums), Roger Waters (bass, vocals) and Richard Wright (keyboards, vocals), with David Gilmour (guitar, vocals) joining at the end of 1967.[1][4] Emerging from London’s mid‑1960s underground scene, they evolved out of earlier student groups such as Sigma 6 and the Tea Set, gradually shifting from rhythm and blues covers to exploratory psychedelic jams while serving as a resident band at clubs like the Countdown Club and playing influential shows at venues such as the Marquee Club and the Roundhouse.[1][3] Under Barrett’s leadership they signed to EMI, released the hit singles “Arnold Layne” and “See Emily Play,” and issued their debut album *The Piper at the Gates of Dawn* (1967), a landmark in British psychedelia noted for its surreal lyrics, experimental sound effects and extended improvisations like “Interstellar Overdrive.”[1][2][4]

After Barrett’s departure in 1968 due to deteriorating mental health, Gilmour assumed lead guitar duties and Waters increasingly became Pink Floyd’s conceptual and lyrical architect, steering the band toward long‑form suites, ambitious studio production and thematically unified albums.[1][2][4] Through releases such as *Atom Heart Mother* (1970), *Meddle* (1971), *The Dark Side of the Moon* (1973), *Wish You Were Here* (1975), *Animals* (1977) and *The Wall* (1979), they pioneered progressive rock with extended compositions, innovative use of studio technology, philosophical and political lyrics, and elaborate live shows featuring quadraphonic sound, film projections and large‑scale stage props.[1][4][6] Internal tensions led to Wright’s departure in 1981 and Waters’ exit in 1985, but Gilmour and Mason continued the band with *A Momentary Lapse of Reason* (1987) and *The Division Bell* (1994), culminating in the largely instrumental *The Endless River* (2014), built from earlier sessions with Wright.[1][2][4] Widely regarded as architects of both psychedelic and progressive rock, Pink Floyd have sold tens of millions of albums worldwide, with *The Dark Side of the Moon* spending more than 900 weeks on the charts, and their influence and legacy are reflected in their induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and the Polar Music Prize, as well as a highly publicized one‑off classic‑lineup reunion at Live 8 in 2005.[2][4][5][6]

Pink Floyd’s musical style blends psychedelic rock, progressive rock, classic rock and art rock, characterized by atmospheric soundscapes, conceptual narratives and meticulous studio craft.[1][4][6] They are known for fusing blues‑based guitar, experimental keyboards, tape loops, spoken‑word elements and sound design into cohesive thematic works that explore madness, alienation, war, consumerism and the human condition.[1][4][6] Their groundbreaking approach to album‑length concepts, immersive concerts and sonic experimentation helped redefine the possibilities of rock music, inspiring generations of musicians across genres and cementing their status as one of the most influential bands in popular music history.[4][6]

## Fun Facts
- The name “Pink Floyd” was coined by Syd Barrett by combining the first names of two Carolina Piedmont blues musicians, Pink Anderson and Floyd Council, after discovering another band was already using their then‑name, the Tea Set.[1][4]
- *The Dark Side of the Moon* became one of the best‑selling and most enduring albums in chart history, remaining on the best‑selling albums chart for more than 900 weeks and solidifying the band’s global reputation.[2][5]
- In 2005, Roger Waters, David Gilmour, Nick Mason and Richard Wright reunited the classic lineup for a one‑off performance at the Live 8 charity concert, their first appearance together in over 24 years.[2]
- Pink Floyd were honored both by induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and by receiving the Polar Music Prize, recognizing their pioneering role in psychedelic and progressive rock and their lasting impact on popular music.[3][6]
