## Biography
Paul Daniel "Ace" Frehley (April 27, 1951 – October 16, 2025) was an American musician best known as the original lead guitarist and a founding member of the legendary rock band Kiss. Born and raised in The Bronx, New York City, Frehley received his first electric guitar at age 14 and quickly developed a passion for music, drawing inspiration from rock icons like The Rolling Stones, Jimi Hendrix, and Led Zeppelin. In 1973, he answered a newspaper ad and successfully auditioned for a then-unnamed band, joining Gene Simmons, Paul Stanley, and Peter Criss to form Kiss, where he created the iconic 'Spaceman' persona and contributed to the band's explosive stage presence and sound.[1][4]

Frehley's tenure with Kiss spanned from 1973 to 1982, during which the band achieved massive commercial success, particularly after the release of "Kiss Alive" in 1975. Known for his aggressive, melodic guitar playing and innovative use of special effects guitars, Frehley became a defining figure in glam rock and metal. After leaving Kiss, he formed Frehley's Comet and launched a solo career, releasing several albums, including his platinum-selling 1978 debut. He rejoined Kiss for their 1996 reunion and remained until 2002, later continuing his solo work, with his final album, "10,000 Volts," released in 2024. Frehley was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2014 as a member of Kiss, cementing his legacy as one of rock's most influential guitarists.[1][2][4]
