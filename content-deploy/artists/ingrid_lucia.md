## Biography
Ingrid Lucia, born in 1971 in the USA, was raised in a family of street musicians, primarily in New Orleans, Louisiana, and Austin, Texas, amid her parents' itinerant lifestyle. She began her musical journey as a dancer with the family band, The Flying Neutrinos, before transitioning to singing by age eight, immersing herself deeply in music from an early age.[1][3][5][6][8] This familial environment honed her skills as a performer, blending swing, retro swing, and vintage styles with a sultry voice and magnetic stage presence.[2][6]

Lucia's career gained momentum in the late 1990s amid the swing revival trend, where she formed her own version of The Flying Neutrinos, releasing music and performing widely. Active primarily in the 1990s and 2000s, she established herself as a dynamic vocalist, bandleader, and songwriter, drawing from pop/rock, alternative/indie rock, and retro swing genres.[4][6] Her work with the band and solo efforts showcased her charismatic performances, often compared to Billie Holiday by critics, though she carved a unique path.[7]

While specific details on her later legacy are limited in available sources, Lucia's enduring association with swing music and her roots in street performance continue to define her as a vibrant figure in niche revival scenes, with ongoing recognition via platforms like Spotify in the swing genre.[context]
