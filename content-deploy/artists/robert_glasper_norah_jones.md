## Biography
Robert Glasper is an American pianist, record producer, songwriter, and musical arranger born on April 5, 1978, in Houston, Texas. He is widely recognized for his innovative fusion of jazz, hip-hop, R&B, and neo-soul, which has helped redefine contemporary jazz and broaden its appeal. Glasper studied at the New School University in Manhattan, where he began performing and collaborating with a diverse range of artists. His breakthrough came with the release of the Robert Glasper Experiment’s album *Black Radio* in 2012, which won a Grammy for Best R&B Album and featured guest appearances from prominent artists such as Erykah Badu, Lupe Fiasco, and Norah Jones. Glasper’s subsequent projects, including *Black Radio 2* and *Black Radio Recovered*, continued to blur genre boundaries and earned further critical acclaim.

Norah Jones is an American singer, songwriter, and pianist born on March 30, 1979, in New York City, New York. She rose to fame with her 2002 debut album *Come Away with Me*, a genre-blending record that fused jazz, country, blues, folk, and pop, ultimately selling over 27 million copies worldwide and winning five Grammy Awards. Jones’s music is characterized by her smooth vocals, introspective lyrics, and subtle jazz sensibilities. Over her career, she has released several platinum-selling albums, including *Feels Like Home*, *Not Too Late*, and *The Fall*, and has collaborated with a wide array of artists across genres. Her work has earned her a reputation as one of the most influential and versatile vocalists of her generation.
