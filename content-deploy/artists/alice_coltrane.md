## Biography
Alice Coltrane (born Alice Lucille McLeod on August 27, 1937, in Detroit, Michigan) was a pioneering American jazz pianist, organist, harpist, composer, and spiritual leader. Raised in a musical family, she began playing piano at a young age, performing in her Baptist church and later studying classical music. In the late 1950s, she spent time in Paris, where she studied jazz with Bud Powell and worked as a pianist at the Blue Note Jazz Club. Returning to Detroit, she established herself as a formidable presence in the local jazz scene, leading her own trio and collaborating with vibraphonist Terry Pollard.

In 1963, while touring with Terry Gibbs, she met saxophonist John Coltrane, whom she married in 1965. Alice replaced McCoy Tyner as pianist in the John Coltrane Quartet in 1966, becoming a central figure in her husband's late ensembles until his death in 1967. Her solo career flourished afterward, marked by a unique blend of jazz, gospel, classical, and Indian spiritual music. Albums such as 'A Monastic Trio,' 'Universal Consciousness,' and 'World Galaxy' showcased her innovative use of the harp and orchestral arrangements, establishing her as a leading voice in spiritual jazz.

Beyond music, Alice Coltrane became known as Swamini Turiyasangitananda, founding the Vedantic Center and leading a spiritual community in California. Her work profoundly influenced the development of spiritual jazz and expanded the role of women in the genre. She remains celebrated for her visionary artistry and her role in bridging musical and spiritual traditions.
