## Biography
Washboard Pete Sanders was a blues musician active in the mid-20th century, best known for his washboard playing in traditional jug and blues styles. He performed alongside guitarist Ralph Willis, covering classic tunes such as Brownie McGhee's 'I've Been Living with the Blues' in live 1950s performances. Little is documented about his early life, but he emerged in the post-war blues scene, contributing to the raw, acoustic sound of that era through recordings and live shows[3][4].

Pete's career centered on collaborations that preserved early blues traditions, including influences from figures like Big Bill Broonzy and Son House, as noted in contemporary interviews. His style emphasized rhythmic washboard accompaniment to guitar-driven blues, evoking the jug band aesthetic with its percussive energy. Performances captured a powerful, evocative quality, bridging Delta blues origins with urban interpretations[4].

Though specific details on his later career and death are scarce, Washboard Pete's legacy endures through rare footage and recordings that highlight his role in authentic blues revivalism. He represents the unsung percussionists who propelled small combo blues acts in the 1940s and 1950s[3].
