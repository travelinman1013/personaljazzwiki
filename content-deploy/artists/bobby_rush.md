## Biography
Bobby Rush, born Emmett Ellis, Jr. in Homer, Louisiana, in 1937, is a legendary American blues musician renowned for his dynamic stage presence and innovative blend of blues, soul, and funk. Growing up in rural Louisiana and later Arkansas, Rush built his first guitar from broom wire and household items, developing his musical skills in juke joints while still a teenager. He adopted the stage name 'Bobby Rush' out of respect for his father, a preacher, and began performing with blues luminaries such as Elmore James and Boyd Gilmore in his youth. 

In the 1950s, Rush moved to Chicago, immersing himself in the city’s vibrant blues scene and collaborating with icons like Muddy Waters, Howlin’ Wolf, Little Walter, Earl Hooker, and Luther Allison. He developed a unique style he called 'folk funk,' fusing traditional blues with contemporary soul and funk elements, and became known for his lively, sometimes risqué performances that combined music, dance, and comedy. His 1971 hit 'Chicken Heads' marked his national breakthrough, and he continued to record prolifically, eventually earning the title 'King of the Chitlin’ Circuit' for his tireless touring across the network of African American clubs in the South. 

Relocating to Jackson, Mississippi, in the early 1980s, Rush expanded his audience and garnered critical acclaim, winning multiple Blues Music Awards and three Grammy Awards. His influence extends across generations, and his late-career resurgence has brought him international recognition, including a historic performance at the Great Wall of China and features in major documentaries. Rush remains a vital force in blues, celebrated for both preserving tradition and pushing the genre forward.
