## Biography
Peter Smith is a British composer and choral conductor, born in 1952 in South London, where he continues to reside. His early education took place at Raynes Park Grammar (now High) School before he advanced to Trinity College of Music as a Junior Exhibitioner. Smith furthered his academic pursuits at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, reading Modern Languages and Music, and studying under several prominent figures in British choral music. 

Although Smith spent much of his professional life as an accountant, with roles at the Royal Opera House, Royal College of Art, and as Finance Director for a charitable organization, his passion for music remained central. In 1976, he founded the Wimbledon Chamber Choir, which he continues to conduct, leading performances of a wide repertoire, including his own compositions. Smith is also an accomplished organist, regularly playing the T. C. Lewis organ at Christ Church, Clapham. His works include 'Breathe on me, Breath of God,' 'Fantasia on “Come Ye Faithful”,' and 'Twelve Hymn Preludes.'

Smith’s musical style is rooted in the English choral tradition, reflecting both his formal training and lifelong engagement with church music. His legacy is particularly marked by his contributions to community choral life in South London, the enduring success of the Wimbledon Chamber Choir, and his original compositions performed in church and festival settings.
