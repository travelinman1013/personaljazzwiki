## Biography
Joseph Leslie Sample was born on February 1, 1939, in Houston, Texas, where he grew up in a fertile musical Creole neighborhood enriched by zydeco and the sounds of Louis Armstrong. He began playing piano at age five and quickly absorbed the diverse musical traditions surrounding him—jazz, gospel, blues, Latin, and classical forms. During his high school years in the 1950s, Sample formed the Swingsters with saxophonist Wilton Felder and drummer Nesbert "Stix" Hooper. While studying at Texas Southern University, he met trombonist Wayne Henderson, and together these musicians evolved their group through the Modern Jazz Sextet before officially establishing the Jazz Crusaders in 1960, modeling themselves after Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers. The group relocated to Los Angeles and quickly gained prominence, releasing their first recording "Freedom Sounds" in 1961 and establishing themselves as innovators in hard bop with their distinctive front-line combination of saxophone and trombone, complemented by Sample's funky, rhythmically appealing acoustic piano playing.

Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Sample became one of the electric keyboard's pioneers, transitioning from acoustic to electric piano as the Jazz Crusaders evolved into simply The Crusaders and embraced jazz-funk fusion. The group achieved commercial success with the hit single "Street Life" and its accompanying 1979 album. Simultaneously, Sample pursued a prolific solo career beginning with his 1969 debut "Fancy Dance" and became one of Los Angeles's most sought-after studio musicians, appearing on recordings by an impressive array of artists including Miles Davis, Joni Mitchell, Marvin Gaye, B.B. King, Eric Clapton, Steely Dan, Anita Baker, and many others. He remained with The Crusaders until their final album in 1991, with a reunion album appearing in 2003 titled "Rural Renewal."

Sample's legacy as a jazz innovator spans more than four decades, establishing him as a critical bridge between hard bop traditions and contemporary jazz fusion. His ability to synthesize gospel, blues, jazz, Latin, and classical elements created a distinctive sound that influenced generations of jazz musicians. He passed away on September 12, 2014, at age 75, leaving behind a catalog of work that demonstrates his versatility as a keyboardist, composer, and bandleader who helped shape the sound of modern jazz.

## Fun Facts
- Sample started playing piano at just five years old and grew up in a musically rich Creole neighborhood in Houston where he was exposed to zydeco and the sounds of jazz legends like Louis Armstrong.
- He was one of the earliest pioneers of the electric keyboard in jazz, beginning to use electric piano in the early 1960s when the instrument was still relatively new, helping to define the sound of jazz fusion.
- Sample's father fought in World War I and shared stories with his son about hearing jazz in Europe, which influenced Sample's understanding of jazz history and its global significance.
- Despite studying at Texas Southern University for three years, Sample never completed his degree, instead choosing to pursue his music career full-time with The Jazz Crusaders, a decision that proved remarkably successful.
