## Biography
Steely Dan is an American rock band founded in 1971 in Annandale-on-Hudson, New York, by Walter Becker and Donald Fagen, who first met as students at Bard College. The duo initially played together in various college bands before relocating to Los Angeles, where they assembled a full band and signed with ABC/Dunhill Records. Their debut album, 'Can't Buy a Thrill' (1972), was a commercial and critical success, noted for its sophisticated blend of rock, jazz, Latin, R&B, and blues influences, as well as its cryptic, irony-laden lyrics.

By the mid-1970s, Becker and Fagen transitioned Steely Dan into a studio-only project, employing a rotating cast of elite session musicians to achieve their increasingly intricate and jazz-infused sound. Albums like 'Pretzel Logic' (1974) and especially 'Aja' (1977) showcased their meticulous production and complex arrangements, earning them both chart success and a reputation for musical perfectionism. Despite disbanding in 1981, Steely Dan's influence persisted, and the group reunited in 1993, releasing new material including the Grammy-winning 'Two Against Nature' (2000). After Becker's death in 2017, Fagen continued to tour under the Steely Dan name.

Steely Dan's legacy is defined by their innovative fusion of genres, intellectual lyricism, and studio mastery. They have sold over 40 million records worldwide and were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001, maintaining a devoted fanbase and enduring critical acclaim.
