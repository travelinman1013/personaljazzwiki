## Biography
Edmonia Henderson (often cited as Jennie Katherine Edmonia Henderson) was an American classic blues singer born around 1898–1900 in Jefferson County, Kentucky, and later associated with Louisville, Kentucky.[1][4][5][6] Little is documented about her early family life or musical education, but by the early 1920s she had entered the Black vaudeville circuit, performing both as a solo act and in Joe Clark’s Revue on the TOBA (Theater Owners Booking Association) circuit, a key network for African‑American performers in the Jim Crow era.[1] In 1925 she appeared in the touring revue *Radio Girls*, sharing the bill with singers Bessie Williams, Mamie Jefferson, and the performer known as Baby Badge, which helped establish her reputation as a strong, expressive classic blues vocalist on the southern and midwestern circuits.[1]

Henderson’s recording career was concentrated in the mid‑1920s, when she cut at least fourteen sides between 1924 and 1926 for labels including Vocalion and Okeh.[1][4] She worked in Chicago and Atlanta studios, recording titles such as “Dead Man Blues” and “Georgia Grind” (both 1926) with pianist‑composer Jelly Roll Morton, as well as several sides accompanied by pianist‑bandleader Lovie Austin and her Blues Serenaders, and sessions featuring trumpeter Tommy Ladnier, pianist Eddie Heywood, and clarinetist Johnny Dodds.[1] Stylistically, she belonged to the classic female blues tradition—strong, theatrical delivery framed by small jazz ensembles—drawing on blues, early jazz, and ragtime idioms that bridged vaudeville and the emerging urban blues market.[1][4] Her records were circulated not only in the United States but also in the United Kingdom, where Oriole issued at least one side in its Race Series under license from Vocalion, placing her alongside contemporaries like Rosa Henderson and Viola McCoy.[1]

By the late 1920s Henderson’s focus shifted from secular performance to religious work. By 1928 she was teaching and giving gospel concerts at the Griffith Conservatory of Music in Louisville, signaling a move into music education and sacred repertoire.[1][4] In 1932 she married and became known as the Reverend Edmonia Buckner, working as an evangelist and gospel singer rather than as a recording blues artist.[1][4] She died in Louisville on February 17, 1947.[1][4][5] Although her recording career was brief and documentation is sparse, Henderson’s work with some of the leading Black jazz and blues accompanists of the 1920s and her presence on early “race records” compilations have made her an enduring, if somewhat obscure, figure in the history of classic blues and early jazz.

## Fun Facts

- Her recording of “Dead Man Blues” was cut in 1926 with its composer Jelly Roll Morton at the piano, creating a rare documented collaboration between a classic blues singer and one of early jazz’s pivotal composers.[1]
- By 1927 at least one of her records had been issued in the United Kingdom on Oriole’s Race Series, placing her voice before an early British audience for African‑American blues and jazz alongside singers like Rosa Henderson and Viola McCoy.[1]
- After leaving secular performance, she became an evangelist and was known as Reverend Edmonia Buckner, teaching and giving gospel concerts at the Griffith Conservatory of Music in Louisville by 1928.[1][4]
