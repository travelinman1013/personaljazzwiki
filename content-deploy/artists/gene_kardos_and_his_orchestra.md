## Biography
Gene Kardos was born on June 12, 1899, in New York City to Hungarian immigrant parents, Joseph and Lottie Kardos[1][2]. Growing up in a culturally rich environment, Kardos developed his musical talents early, becoming proficient on the violin and saxophone. By the late 1920s, he was active in the New York music scene, performing in vaudeville and dance bands before forming his own orchestra in the early 1930s[1][2].

Kardos's orchestra gained prominence as the house band at the Gloria Palast, a major Yorkville dance hall, where their energetic, precise performances attracted both audiences and music publishers[1][5]. The band was known for its fast-paced, 'hot' dance music, though like many contemporaries, they adopted a 'sweeter' style as public taste shifted during the Depression[2]. Kardos recorded prolifically under his own name and various pseudonyms for labels such as Victor, Electradisk, and ARC, with some sides released as 'Gene's Merrymakers'[2][3]. His band featured top New York musicians and was praised for its tight arrangements, many crafted by Bernie Green[1].

By 1939, after marrying, Kardos retired from music to work for the United States Post Office, ending a decade-long recording career that left a modest but respected legacy in early swing and dance band music[2]. He died in 1980, remembered for his contributions to the vibrant New York dance orchestra scene of the 1930s.
