## Biography
Don Cherry (1936–1995) was an American jazz trumpeter, cornetist, and multi-instrumentalist, born in Oklahoma City and raised in Los Angeles. Immersed in music from a young age—his father was a bartender with a passion for swing—Cherry grew up surrounded by the vibrant jazz and rhythm and blues scene of Watts, Los Angeles, where he encountered musicians like Dexter Gordon and Sonny Criss. He began on trumpet and piano, absorbing bebop before gravitating toward the avant-garde.

Cherry's career took a pivotal turn when he met saxophonist Ornette Coleman, joining Coleman's groundbreaking quartet and contributing to seminal free jazz albums such as 'The Shape of Jazz to Come' (1959) and 'Free Jazz: A Collective Improvisation' (1961). Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Cherry collaborated with major innovators including John Coltrane, Charlie Haden, and Sun Ra, and released his own influential works like 'Complete Communion' (1966). He became a pioneer of world fusion, incorporating African, Middle Eastern, and Indian musical traditions, notably in the group Codona and on albums like 'Brown Rice' (1975).

Cherry's legacy is defined by his adventurous spirit and commitment to musical freedom. He was instrumental in expanding the boundaries of jazz, both through his improvisational approach and his integration of global sounds. His influence extends to later generations of jazz and world musicians, and his children, Eagle-Eye Cherry and Neneh Cherry, have also achieved international recognition in music.
