## Biography
Rockin' Dopsie (also spelled Rockin' Dupsee), born Alton Jay Rubin on February 10, 1932, in Carencro, Louisiana, was a pivotal figure in the development and popularization of zydeco music—a vibrant blend of Cajun, Creole, blues, and R&B traditions. Growing up in a Creole French-speaking family, Dopsie was immersed in the musical culture of southwest Louisiana from an early age. He received his first accordion at 14 and, being left-handed, taught himself to play it upside down, a unique trait that became part of his signature style. By his late teens, he was performing at local parties and quickly surpassed his father's musical abilities, eventually moving to Lafayette to pursue music more seriously.

Dopsie began his professional career in the 1950s, playing in Louisiana clubs with his cousin Chester Zeno on washboard. He was known for his energetic performances and his ability to blend traditional Creole and Cajun sounds with contemporary R&B, making zydeco accessible to wider audiences. Despite working as an electrical contractor by day, he recorded sporadically for small labels throughout the 1950s and 1960s. His international breakthrough came in the 1970s after being signed by the Swedish label Sonet, which led to acclaimed albums and regular European tours. Dopsie's stature grew further in the 1980s, especially after collaborating with Paul Simon on the song "That Was Your Mother" from the landmark album 'Graceland.'

Rockin' Dopsie is remembered as one of zydeco's foundational artists, alongside Clifton Chenier and Boozoo Chavis. His legacy includes not only a rich catalog of recordings but also a family tradition: his son, Rockin' Dopsie Jr., continues to perform under the same stage name, ensuring that the Dopsie influence endures in the world of zydeco.
