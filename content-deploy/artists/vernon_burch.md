## Biography
Vernon Darrell Burch (July 28, 1955 – September 21, 2022) was an American R&B/soul singer and guitarist born in Washington, D.C. He began his career as a teen prodigy, joining the Delfonics at age 13 as a guitarist for two years in the late 1960s, followed by a stint with the Bar-Kays in the early 1970s. In 1975, he signed with United Artists, releasing his debut album *I'll Be Your Sunshine*, and later recorded for Columbia Records, Chocolate City Records (distributed by Casablanca), and Spector Records, producing a series of soul and post-disco albums including *When I Get Back Home* (1977), *Love-A-Thon* (1978), *Get Up* (1979), *Stepping Out* (1980), and *Playing Hard to Get* (1982).[1][2][3][4]

Burch's musical style blended R&B, soul, and post-disco elements, highlighted by singles like 'Changes (Messin' with My Mind)' and 'Do It to Me,' both reaching the Billboard R&B top 20 in 1975 and 1981, respectively. Other notable tracks included 'Brighter Days,' 'Steppin' Out,' 'Love Is,' 'Never Can Find a Way (Hot Love),' 'Once Again in My Life,' 'Get Up,' and 'Fun City.' His song 'Get Up' gained renewed fame in the 1990s when sampled by Deee-Lite in their hit 'Groove is in the Heart.' Despite modest commercial success, Burch's guitar-driven soul sound left a niche legacy in funk and disco circles.[1][2]

Burch passed away on September 21, 2022, at age 67, with his death announced by former Supremes member Susaye Greene. His work remains appreciated by soul enthusiasts and through sampling in later music, underscoring his influence on subsequent generations despite limited mainstream recognition.[1]
