## Biography
Womack & Womack was a soul and R&B duo formed by husband and wife Cecil Womack and Linda Womack (née Cooke), who began recording together in the early 1980s. Cecil, born in Cleveland, Ohio, was part of the famed Womack musical family and had a background in gospel and soul, performing with his brothers as The Valentinos under the mentorship of Sam Cooke. Linda, the daughter of soul legend Sam Cooke, brought her own deep musical heritage and songwriting talent to the partnership. Their collaboration as Womack & Womack began in 1983, marked by the release of their debut album 'Love Wars,' which received critical acclaim and produced hits like the title track and 'Baby I'm Scared of You.'

Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, Womack & Womack released a series of albums blending soul, R&B, pop, and funk, with Linda's emotive vocals and Cecil's production and songwriting at the core. Their 1988 single 'Teardrops,' from the album 'Conscience,' became an international hit, selling millions of copies and cementing their place in pop and dance music history. Their music was noted for its sophisticated arrangements, heartfelt lyrics, and seamless fusion of American soul traditions with contemporary pop sensibilities.

After discovering ancestral roots in Nigeria, the duo adopted the names Zeriiya and Zekkariyas and moved to South Africa in the 1990s, where they continued to make music with their children as The House of Zekkariyas. Cecil Womack passed away in 2013, but the legacy of Womack & Womack endures, with their songs frequently covered and sampled by later generations of artists.
