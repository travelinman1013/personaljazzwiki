## Biography
Osiris Marsh, known professionally as Osiris, is a soul and funk vocalist hailing from Washington, D.C., born in the 1950s. He began singing at the age of five in church, captivating friends and family with his early performances. By his teenage years, Osiris was harmonizing with local vocal groups such as The Romantics and later formed his own doo-wop outfit, The Stridells, with schoolmates from Eastern High School. His early years were marked by a deep immersion in the rich musical culture of D.C., where he honed his craft in vocal harmony and performance.

In the early 1970s, Osiris co-founded the group Destiny, a versatile vocal ensemble that blended avant-garde harmonies with soul and funk influences. Destiny opened for prominent acts like Rare Earth and New Birth and released a single on RCA Records. Osiris's songwriting and vocal talents led him to join The Family, where he wrote and co-wrote every song on their 1977 album 'Music,' which charted on the R&B charts. After leaving The Family, Osiris continued as a solo artist, building his own studio, writing over a hundred songs, and releasing new material well into the 1990s. His enduring career has made him a respected figure in the D.C. soul and funk scene, with a dedicated following in the U.S. and Japan, though he remains relatively underappreciated internationally.
