## Biography
Gina Leslie is a singer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist born into a musical family in Evergreen, Colorado. Her early years were steeped in the traditions of American roots music, attending bluegrass festivals, fiddle camps, and family jam sessions that shaped her musical foundation. She began playing fiddle at age five, absorbing the oral traditions of folk and bluegrass by learning songs by ear in communal settings.

After years of honing her craft across genres from bluegrass to folk to jazz, Leslie relocated to New Orleans, where she became a sought-after side musician and collaborator in the vibrant local scene. Her debut solo EP, 'No, You’re Crying,' released in February 2022, showcases her ability to blend country, jazz, and Americana, weaving pedal steel, fiddle, and lush harmonies into songs that balance melancholy with hope. Leslie’s songwriting is marked by emotional depth and a delicate touch, often exploring themes of heartbreak, longing, and resilience. Her music has been described as ageless and traditional, yet deeply personal, capturing the bittersweet complexities of love and loss.

In addition to her solo work, Leslie is known for her collaborations with New Orleans artists and bands, including The Sam Doores Band, Ric Robertson, Esther Rose, and her family group, The Bad Bad Leslies. Her artistry is characterized by a warm, velvety vocal style and a genre-fusing approach that pays tribute to American musical traditions while forging her own distinct sound.
