## Biography
Ray Parker Jr. & Raydio emerged from Detroit's vibrant music scene in the late 1970s, led by the multi-talented Ray Parker Jr., who was already an accomplished session guitarist and songwriter by his early twenties. Parker, born in 1954, was inspired by his elementary school music teacher and honed his craft in Detroit's clubs, working with Motown legends and recording with artists like Marvin Gaye and the Spinners as a teenager. In 1977, he formed Raydio with Vincent Bonham, Jerry Knight, and Arnell Carmichael, quickly achieving commercial success with the hit single 'Jack and Jill,' followed by 'You Can't Change That,' both of which became Top 10 pop and R&B hits.

As the group evolved into Ray Parker Jr. & Raydio in 1980, they continued their streak with albums like 'Two Places at the Same Time' and 'A Woman Needs Love,' the latter producing a No. 1 R&B hit. Raydio's sound blended funk, R&B, and pop, characterized by catchy hooks, smooth harmonies, and Parker's distinctive guitar work. After the group disbanded in 1981, Parker launched a highly successful solo career, most notably writing and performing the iconic 'Ghostbusters' theme, which topped charts worldwide and won him a Grammy Award. Parker's legacy is marked by his versatility as a musician, songwriter, and producer, influencing the sound of late 20th-century R&B and pop.
