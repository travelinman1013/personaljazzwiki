## Biography
Paul Daigle and Robert Elkins, co-leaders of the band Cajun Gold, are prominent figures in the Cajun and zydeco music scenes of Louisiana. Paul Daigle was born in 1958 in Point Noir near Church Point, Louisiana, and began playing accordion at age ten. As a teenager, he won several accordion contests in Church Point, quickly establishing himself as one of Acadiana’s most talented accordionists. Robert Elkins, born in Church Point, began his musical journey at age twelve, forming his first group, 'Little Robert and the Satisfiers,' in 1956. After serving in the Navy and living in California for twelve years, Elkins returned to Louisiana and immersed himself in Cajun music, eventually teaming up with Daigle.

Together, Daigle and Elkins formed Cajun Gold in the early 1980s, with the group becoming one of the premier Cajun bands from the mid-1980s until 1992. Their music, rooted in traditional Cajun styles, featured regional hits such as 'Tee Bec Doux' and 'The New Anniversary Waltz.' Cajun Gold was especially popular in the Lafayette area, winning numerous contests and popularity polls. The band recorded for Swallow Records and included notable members such as Ken Smith (fiddle), Tony Thibodeaux (violin), Michael Doucet (violin), Kelly Hebert (bass), Vernon Bergeron (drums), and David Cormier (drums). Pierre V. Daigle, Paul’s relative, contributed many original songs and served as record producer for the group.

Cajun Gold’s legacy is marked by their dedication to preserving and revitalizing Cajun music during a time when the tradition risked fading. Their influence extended beyond Louisiana, with performances around the world, including in Denmark and China. Paul Daigle continues to perform selectively, maintaining his reputation as a master accordionist, while Robert Elkins is remembered for his powerful vocals and guitar work. The group has received multiple Cajun French Music Association awards, including Male Vocalist of the Year and Song of the Year, cementing their place in Cajun music history.
