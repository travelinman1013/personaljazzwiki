## Biography
John Scofield, born December 26, 1951 in Dayton, Ohio, is a highly influential American jazz guitarist and composer. Raised in Wilton, Connecticut, Scofield began playing guitar at age 11, initially inspired by rock and blues musicians such as B.B. King, Jimi Hendrix, and Eric Clapton. His musical interests broadened after being introduced to jazz at age 15, leading him to study at Berklee College of Music in Boston, where he deepened his understanding of jazz theory and improvisation[1][3][5].

Scofield's professional career began in the early 1970s, quickly gaining recognition through collaborations with jazz luminaries such as Gerry Mulligan, Chet Baker, and Charles Mingus. He became a member of the Billy Cobham-George Duke Band, and later joined Gary Burton's quartet, replacing Pat Metheny. His international profile rose significantly during his tenure with Miles Davis from 1982 to 1985, contributing to several Davis albums and solidifying his reputation as a leading voice in jazz guitar[1][3][4].

Throughout his career, Scofield has released over 40 albums as a leader, exploring styles from post-bop and jazz fusion to funk, blues, and soul jazz. He is renowned for his distinctive sound, improvisational mastery, and stylistic versatility. Scofield's collaborations span a wide array of artists, including Pat Metheny, Bill Frisell, Herbie Hancock, Joe Lovano, and Medeski, Martin & Wood. His innovative approach and openness to musical experimentation have made him a central figure in modern jazz, earning him three Grammy Awards and a lasting legacy as both a performer and educator[1][3][4][5][6].
