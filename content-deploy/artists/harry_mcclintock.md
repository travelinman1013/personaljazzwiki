## Biography
Harry McClintock, also known as "Haywire Mac," was born on October 8, 1884, in Uhrichsville, Ohio, though his family soon moved to Knoxville, Tennessee.  His early life was marked by a restless spirit; he ran away to join the circus and subsequently led a nomadic existence, working as a railroader in Africa, a seaman, and a civilian mule train packer supplying American soldiers in the Philippines.  He even served as an aide to newsmen covering the Boxer Rebellion in China in 1899.  His experiences traveling as a railroader and minstrel across America profoundly shaped his musical perspective and provided rich material for his songwriting.

McClintock's career took off in 1925 when he won a KFRC Radio talent contest with his song "The Big Rock Candy Mountains." This victory secured him spots on two radio shows:  "Mac and His Gang," a children's program featuring his "Haywire Orchestry," and the variety show "Blue Monday Jamboree," where he collaborated with notable figures like Meredith Willson, Bea Benaderet, Edna Fischer, and Jess Oppenheimer. He was also a member of Al Pearce's "The Happy Go Lucky Hour," another KFRC show.  "The Big Rock Candy Mountains" achieved significant success, reaching No. 1 on Billboard's "Hillbilly Hits" chart in 1939 and later appearing in the Coen brothers' film *O Brother, Where Art Thou?*  His song "The Old Chisholm Trail" was also featured in the documentary series *The West*.  Beyond his radio work, McClintock was active in the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), participating in significant labor actions and writing the IWW's marching song, "Hallelujah, I'm a Bum." He also notably introduced Joe Hill's "The Preacher and the Slave" to a wider audience.

McClintock's musical style blended elements of folk, country, and perhaps minstrel traditions, reflecting his diverse life experiences. His songs often conveyed a sense of wanderlust and working-class solidarity.  His most famous song, "The Big Rock Candy Mountains," remains a beloved classic, showcasing his storytelling abilities and enduring appeal.  His legacy extends beyond his popular songs; his involvement in the IWW and his influence on writers like Jim Thompson, who incorporated him into his short stories, demonstrate his impact beyond the realm of music. His inclusion in Robert Crumb's "Heroes of Blues, Jazz and Country" trading cards further solidifies his place in American musical history.
