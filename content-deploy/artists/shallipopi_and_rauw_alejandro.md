## Biography
Rauw Alejandro, born Raúl Alejandro Ocasio Ruiz on January 10, 1993, in San Juan, Puerto Rico, is a leading figure in contemporary Latin music, often associated with reggaeton, Latin R&B, urbano and Latin trap.[2][1] Raised between Canóvanas and Carolina, he initially pursued soccer before a setback and ensuing depression pushed him to focus seriously on music, uploading tracks to SoundCloud around 2014 and self-releasing his debut mixtape *Punto de Equilibrio* in 2016.[2] His career accelerated after signing with Duars Entertainment and joining Sony Music Latin’s emerging-artist project “Los Próximos,” which led to early collaborations and his breakout single “Toda” (2017) with Alex Rose, followed by a high-profile remix and a growing presence on the Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart.[2]

From 2020 onward, Rauw consolidated his status as one of the central voices in urbano latino. His debut studio album *Afrodisíaco* (2020) and its follow-up *Vice Versa* (2021), featuring the global hit “Todo de Ti,” showcased his hybrid sound, blending reggaeton with melodic pop, R&B textures and ballads in a sleek, dance-forward aesthetic that distinguished him from more traditional reggaetoneros.[2][3] Subsequent projects, including *Saturno*, *Playa Saturno* and the roots-focused *Cosa Nuestra*, along with collaborations with major artists like Shakira, Ozuna, J Balvin, Bad Bunny and Jennifer Lopez, solidified a reputation *Rolling Stone* has described as “the greatest showman in Latin music,” with live shows compared to Broadway productions.[2][3] Drawing inspiration from artists such as Michael Jackson, Elvis Presley, Ricky Martin, Daddy Yankee, Chris Brown, Ciara, Bruno Mars and Rihanna, he has become a key bridge between classic reggaeton and a more genre-fluid, global Latin pop, winning multiple Latin Grammy and Billboard Latin Music Awards while influencing the sound and staging of a new generation of urbano performers.[2][1][3]

"Shallipopi" refers to Nigerian artist Crown Uzama (not a joint project or alias of Rauw Alejandro), who has collaborated with him on the 2024 remix “Laho III,” blending Afrobeats with Latin urbano; there is no evidence they operate as a single act called “shallipopi & rauw alejandro.”[4] Rauw’s connection to Shallipopi thus far is limited to this cross-continental collaboration rather than a shared biographical or band identity.[4]
