## Biography
Bermuda Triangle is a Nashville-based indie folk trio formed in 2017, consisting of Brittany Howard (Alabama Shakes frontwoman), Becca Mancari, and Jesse Lafser. The supergroup came together organically when three friends started hanging out, playing music for each other in their backyard, and discovered they were having so much fun that they decided to take it to the stage. They made their live debut in summer 2017 at the Basement East in Nashville, with Rolling Stone noting that their chemistry "was clear from the first-applause-silencing note." The formation was entirely unintentional—simply about having fun with friends—and they brought that laid-back energy and excitement to their performances.

Musically, Bermuda Triangle features Howard switching between nylon-string guitar solos and upright bass, while Mancari and Lafser trade off on banjo and acoustic guitar, accompanied by subtle beats from a drum machine. Their sound has been described as "pitch-perfect harmony-heavy" folk tunes that are "blithe and breezy" yet heartfelt, creating what observers called "chill vibes" during their sweltering debut performance. The trio released two singles, "Rosey" and "Suzanne," and another track titled "Till The End Of Days," which showcased their sublime combination of rich, tight harmonies balanced with distinctive vocal timbres and lean, airy acoustic guitar arrangements.

The band's set typically includes about 15 songs, drawing from tracks across the members' individual projects, though notably not including Alabama Shakes material. As of the available information, Bermuda Triangle has not released a full album, maintaining an air of mystery that matches their enigmatic name. All three members have remained active with their solo careers—Mancari released albums including "Good Woman" (2017), "The Greatest Part" (2020), and "Left Hand" (2023); Lafser was working on a follow-up to 2015's "Raised On the Plains"; and Howard continued her work with Alabama Shakes and solo endeavors.
