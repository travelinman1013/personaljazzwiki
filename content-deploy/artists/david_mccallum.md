## Biography
David McCallum was born on September 19, 1933, in Glasgow, Scotland, into a distinguished musical family.[3] His father, David McCallum Sr., was the principal first violinist and leader of the London Philharmonic Orchestra, while his mother, Dorothy Dorman, was a cellist.[3] Young David began playing the oboe around age 6 or 7 after his father consulted with friends about which instrument suited him best.[3] Despite his classical training and preparation for a music career at University College School in London, McCallum ultimately pursued acting, joining Actor's Equity in 1946 and beginning his career with BBC Radio work.[4]

While McCallum became internationally famous as an actor—particularly for his role as Illya Kuryakin in *The Man from U.N.C.L.E.* (1964) and later as Dr. Donald "Ducky" Mallard on *NCIS*—he maintained his musical pursuits throughout his career.[3][4] Between 1966 and 1967, during the height of his television success, he released four instrumental albums for Capitol Records with producer David Axelrod.[3] These albums featured him as a conductor leading easy listening orchestras in arrangements of modern pop songs, including covers of Beatles and Stevie Wonder compositions, as well as the *Batman* theme.[1][3]

McCallum's most enduring musical legacy stems from "The Edge," a track from his 1966 album *Music: A Bit More of Me*.[3] This instrumental arrangement became the basis for Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg's 1999 hit "The Next Episode," which peaked at No. 23 on the Billboard Hot 100 and has been streamed nearly 874 million times on Spotify.[3] According to music database WhoSampled, "The Edge" has been sampled in 43 songs total by artists including John Legend, Kendrick Lamar, and Kevin Federline, while the original version appeared on the 2017 film *Baby Driver* soundtrack.[3] McCallum died of natural causes on September 25, 2023, at age 90, leaving behind a unique legacy as both a celebrated actor and an influential musician.[3][4]

## Fun Facts
- McCallum's instrumental track 'The Edge' from 1966 became one of the most sampled pieces in hip-hop history, with 43 documented samples including Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg's 'The Next Episode,' which has been streamed nearly 874 million times on Spotify.[3]
- Despite being trained as an oboe player and coming from a classical music family, McCallum left the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art to pursue acting, ultimately becoming more famous for his television roles than his music career.[4]
- McCallum's father, David McCallum Sr., was one of 40 musicians assembled to perform on The Beatles' track 'A Day in the Life' in 1967, and later led Annunzio Mantovani's orchestra, where Mantovani would introduce him to audiences with the quip, 'We can afford the father but not the son!' referring to his son's greater fame.[2]
- McCallum was remarkably positive about his life and relationships; he reportedly held no hard feelings toward Charles Bronson after Bronson married his first wife, actress Jill Ireland, whom McCallum had met while filming Hell Drivers in 1957.[1][4]
