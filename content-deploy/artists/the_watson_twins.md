## Biography
The Watson Twins are an Americana duo formed by identical twin sisters Chandra and Leigh Watson, born on March 17, 1975, in Tulsa, Oklahoma and raised in Louisville, Kentucky[1][2][5]. Their early musical experiences were shaped by singing in church choirs and listening to gospel and country classics, which laid the foundation for their signature harmonies and southern-rooted sound[2][3]. After attending the University of Evansville, they moved to Los Angeles in 1998, where they became founding members of the indie rock band Slydell and immersed themselves in the Silver Lake music scene[1][2].

The Watson Twins gained national attention in 2006 through their collaboration with Jenny Lewis on the critically acclaimed album "Rabbit Fur Coat," released concurrently with their own debut EP "Southern Manners"[1][2]. Their subsequent albums, including "Fire Songs" (2008), "Talking To You, Talking To Me" (2010), "DUO" (2018), and "Holler" (2023), showcase their evolution from harmony singers to accomplished songwriters and performers, blending alt-country, vintage soul, and modern Americana[1][3][4]. Their work is characterized by close harmonies, heartfelt lyrics, and a seamless blend of influences from the American South.

Now based in Nashville, the twins continue to perform both as a duo and with their Tennessee-based band, collaborating with a range of musicians and producers. Their legacy is marked by their contributions to modern roots music, their collaborative spirit, and their ability to honor tradition while pushing creative boundaries[3][4].
