## Biography
Rhye is a sensual, understated R&B and art‑pop project created and led by Canadian singer, songwriter, producer and multi‑instrumentalist Michael (Mike) Milosh, who was born in Toronto and later based in Berlin and Los Angeles.[1][4] A classically trained cellist who also studied jazz and vocals at university, Milosh initially released electronic music under his own surname before growing frustrated with the confines of Berlin’s club scene and looking for a more organic, vocally driven outlet.[3][4][5] In 2010–2011 he quietly began Rhye as a collaboration with Danish producer and instrumentalist Robin Hannibal, releasing the enigmatic singles “Open” and “The Fall” with minimal imagery and no clear credits, which sparked online speculation about the band’s identity and even Milosh’s gender due to his androgynous, high‑lying voice.[2][4]

Rhye’s debut album *Woman* arrived in 2013, blending intimate, R&B‑inflected songwriting, hushed falsetto vocals and meticulously arranged live instrumentation into what critics hailed as a sophisticated, sensual and emotionally direct sound; it was praised by outlets such as Pitchfork, The Guardian, The New York Times and longlisted for the 2013 Polaris Music Prize.[2][4] Though originally conceived as a duo with Hannibal, contractual issues with Hannibal’s other project Quadron meant that Rhye quickly evolved into Milosh’s primary solo vehicle, with him handling most composition, production and performance and then expanding the music on tour with a rotating cast of multi‑instrumentalists.[1][2] He followed *Woman* with the fuller‑band sophomore LP *Blood* (2018), the piano‑focused and largely acoustic project *Spirit* (2019), and the expansive, home‑recorded album *Home* (2021), all of which reinforced Rhye’s reputation for “reserved, understated and brilliant” soul‑pop that favors subtle dynamics, real strings and live drums over heavy digital processing.[1][2]

Musically, Rhye is often described as sitting at the intersection of alternative R&B, soft soul, indie pop and downtempo, with critics comparing Milosh’s airy, unforced falsetto and intimate mood to artists like Sade and The xx while noting his background in classical and jazz performance.[2][4][5] Milosh’s preference for organic textures—string sections, horns, piano and understated grooves—reflects his move away from purely electronic production, and he treats his voice as another instrument, weaving it into layered arrangements that explore themes of love, sensuality, vulnerability and domestic space.[1][4] Beyond Rhye’s studio work, Milosh has scored films, developed immersive ambient events through the Secular Sabbath project with his partner Genevieve Medow Jenkins, and built a rigorous live show that has seen Rhye perform hundreds of concerts worldwide, helping shape the broader 2010s wave of intimate, emotionally driven R&B‑adjacent music.[1][2][3]

## Fun Facts
- Before focusing on music full‑time, Michael Milosh worked as a professional photographer, a craft he began as a teenager developing film with his father in a home darkroom, and he has personally shot every Rhye album cover except the debut Woman.[3]
- When Rhye first appeared online with the songs “Open” and “The Fall,” the project offered almost no biographical information, leading many listeners to assume the singer was a woman because of Milosh’s light, androgynous vocal tone.[2][4]
- Milosh has said that he grew tired of working solely on computers and deliberately shifted Rhye toward real instruments—strings, winds, live drums and carefully recorded piano—to capture what he calls the ‘magic’ of instrumental performance.[1]
- To resolve contractual issues with his former label after the success of Woman, Milosh spent years on the road touring intensely under the Rhye name, playing more than 800 concerts worldwide to finance legal fees and regain control over his career.[1]

## Musical Connections

### Mentors/Influences
- [[classical_and_jazz_teachers_unnamed|Classical and jazz teachers (unnamed)]] - Milosh is a classically trained cellist and studied jazz and vocal performance at university, indicating formal instruction that shaped his harmonic language, string writing and vocal technique. (Foundational training reflected across Rhye albums such as Woman, Blood, Spirit and Home through string arrangements and jazz‑inflected harmony.) [Pre‑Rhye, during Milosh’s youth and university studies (1990s–early 2000s).]
- [[sade_stylistic_influence|Sade (stylistic influence)]] - Critics and writers frequently compare Rhye’s smooth, androgynous vocals and sensual, minimalist arrangements to Sade, positioning her work as a key aesthetic reference point rather than a direct personal relationship. (Rhye’s debut album Woman and subsequent releases are often likened to Sade’s blend of soft soul and understated R&B.[4]) [Influence noted particularly around the release and reception of Woman (2013 onward).[4]]

### Key Collaborators
- [[robin_hannibal|Robin Hannibal]] - Danish producer and instrumentalist who co‑founded Rhye as an R&B‑leaning studio project, co‑creating the early sound and initial recordings before departing due to contractual conflicts with his group Quadron. (Early Rhye singles such as “Open” and “The Fall” and material associated with the debut period surrounding Woman.[1][4]) [Circa 2011–2013, during the formation of Rhye and the release of Woman.[1][4]]
- [[ólafur_arnalds|Ólafur Arnalds]] - Icelandic composer and multi‑instrumentalist who contributed to Rhye’s piano‑centered, chamber‑like project, adding his signature minimalist and neoclassical touch. (Collaborations on the piano‑focused project Spirit (2019).[2]) [Around the creation and release of Spirit in 2019.[2]]
- [[dan_wilson|Dan Wilson]] - Songwriter and producer who collaborated with Milosh on the intimate, stripped‑back material that defines Rhye’s Spirit project. (Collaborations on the Spirit (2019) sessions.[2]) [Circa 2019.[2]]
- [[touring_multiinstrumentalists_approximately_8piece_live_band|Touring multi‑instrumentalists (approximately 8‑piece live band)]] - Milosh regularly expands Rhye into a full, flexible live ensemble of strings, drums, keys and horns, transforming the recorded material into dynamic performances. (Live interpretations of Woman, Blood, Spirit and Home across extensive world touring; Milosh estimates more than 800 shows since 2013.[1][2]) [2013 onward.[1]]
- [[diplo|Diplo]] - World‑renowned producer with whom Milosh has discussed and begun work on a more dance‑oriented project distinct from Rhye’s usual quiet storm aesthetic. (A separate, as‑yet‑unreleased dancefloor‑leaning project mentioned by Milosh, not necessarily issued under the Rhye name.[1]) [Project discussed around 2019–2020.[1]]
- [[genevieve_medow_jenkins|Genevieve Medow Jenkins]] - Milosh’s partner and creative collaborator on Secular Sabbath, an immersive ambient music and wellness event series for which he composes atmospheric music and often performs. (Secular Sabbath events and associated ambient compositions, running in parallel with Rhye.[1]) [Late 2010s onward.[1]]

### Artists Influenced
- [[emerging_alternative_randb_and_indiesoul_artists_unspecified|Emerging alternative R&B and indie‑soul artists (unspecified)]] - While concrete one‑to‑one protégés are not documented, Rhye’s critically acclaimed blend of intimate vocals, sparse arrangements and R&B‑inflected chamber pop has been cited as part of a broader movement that shaped subsequent alt‑R&B and indie‑soul acts who value subtlety and live instrumentation. (The albums Woman, Blood, Spirit and Home, frequently referenced in press as touchstones for ‘understated’ and ‘sensuous’ R&B‑pop.[2][4]) [Mid‑2010s onward, following the impact of Woman (2013).]
