## Biography
Aaron Neville, born January 24, 1941, in New Orleans, Louisiana, is celebrated for his smooth, vibrato-rich tenor and a career that spans R&B, soul, gospel, jazz, country, and pop. He first rose to national prominence in 1966 with the hit single 'Tell It Like It Is,' later inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, and went on to become a founding member of the Neville Brothers, often referred to as the 'First Family of New Orleans Music.' Despite early struggles—including poverty, legal troubles, and addiction—Neville's resilience and faith helped him build a remarkable solo career, earning four Grammy Awards and collaborating with artists like Linda Ronstadt and Trisha Yearwood[4][2].

The Dirty Dozen Brass Band, established in 1977 in New Orleans, revolutionized the brass band tradition by infusing funk and bebop into classic New Orleans jazz. Emerging from the Fairview Baptist Church Marching Band under the mentorship of Danny Barker, the group revitalized the local brass band scene at a time when its popularity had waned. Their innovative approach and energetic performances brought them international acclaim and collaborations with a wide range of artists, including Aaron Neville[1][3].

In 2023, Aaron Neville and the Dirty Dozen Brass Band joined forces on the Grammy-winning track 'Stompin' Ground,' a testament to their shared roots and enduring influence in American roots music. This collaboration highlights the cross-generational and cross-genre legacy of both Neville and the Dirty Dozen Brass Band, underscoring their pivotal roles in shaping the sound and spirit of New Orleans music[4][3][7].
