## Biography
Tevin Jermod Campbell was born on November 12, 1976, in Waxahachie, Texas, to Rhonda Byrd, a postal worker who would later become his manager. Growing up in a musical household where his mother sang in the church choir at Joshua Chapel A.M.E., Campbell began performing gospel music at an early age, first as a choir member and later as a soloist. At just 12 years old, a family friend arranged for him to audition for jazz musician Bobbi Humphrey, who was so impressed that she organized a videotaped showcase in Manhattan. When manager Benny Medina saw the tape, he signed Campbell to a contract and the family relocated to Encino, Los Angeles, setting the stage for his meteoric rise in the music industry.[1][2]

Campbell's professional career launched spectacularly in 1989 when producer Quincy Jones enlisted him to perform lead vocals on "Tomorrow (A Better You, Better Me)" for Jones's ensemble album *Back on the Block*. The song reached number one on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop chart in June 1990 when Campbell was just 14 years old, establishing him as a prodigious talent in the new jack swing and quiet storm genres.[2][3] Following this breakthrough, Campbell collaborated with Prince on his first solo hit "Round and Round," which charted at number 3 on the R&B chart and number 12 on the Billboard Hot 100. In November 1991, Campbell released his platinum-selling debut album *T.E.V.I.N.*, which featured multiple top 5 R&B hits including "Tell Me What You Want Me to Do," "Alone with You," and "Goodbye." The album's success, combined with his sultry vocal delivery and sophisticated R&B style, cemented Campbell's status as one of the most promising young artists of the early 1990s.[1][2][3]

## Fun Facts
- Campbell achieved his first number-one hit "Tomorrow (A Better You, Better Me)" when he was just 13-14 years old, making him one of the youngest artists to top the R&B charts in 1990.[3]
- He appeared on the popular TV show *The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air* in 1991, playing a teen idol character named "Little T" who was the celebrity crush of Ashley Banks, demonstrating his crossover appeal beyond music.[1]
- Campbell's debut album *T.E.V.I.N.* was released just eight days after his 15th birthday in November 1991, and it went Platinum with four top 5 R&B hits, an extraordinary achievement for such a young artist.[3]
- Despite his early success starting at age 12, Campbell described his childhood as extremely work-intensive, spending most of his time in the studio, doing videos, press tours, and photo sessions rather than experiencing a typical childhood in his small Texas hometown.[6]
