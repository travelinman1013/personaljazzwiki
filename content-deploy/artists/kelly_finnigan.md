## Biography
Kelly Finnigan is an American soul singer, songwriter, producer, engineer, and multi‑instrumentalist, known both as the frontman of the psychedelic soul band Monophonics and as a leading voice in the contemporary soul revival. Born in 1981 in Los Angeles, California, he grew up in a deeply musical household: his father, keyboardist and singer Mike Finnigan, worked with artists such as Jimi Hendrix, Joe Cocker, and Bonnie Raitt, keeping the home filled with classic rock, soul, and blues.[5][6][3][7] Despite this, Kelly initially resisted formal musical training, instead gravitating as a teenager toward hip‑hop, DJ culture, beat‑making, and sampling, which led him to start DJing and immersing himself in crate‑digging and production.[5][7]

After moving from Los Angeles to the San Francisco Bay Area, Finnigan founded the hip‑hop production crew Destruments and opened his own studio and label, Transistor Sound, where he honed his skills as an engineer and producer while releasing instrumental projects for West Coast rappers, including members of the Hieroglyphics collective.[5] He joined Monophonics around 2011, becoming their lead vocalist and a key songwriter and producer as the band developed a rich, psychedelic‑soul sound across multiple albums.[10][9] Parallel to his band work, he became a core creative partner of Colemine Records, contributing as an engineer, producer, instrumentalist, songwriter, and/or singer to more than 30 releases for artists on labels like Colemine, Daptone, and Truth & Soul.[1][5] In 2019 he released his debut solo album, "The Tales People Tell" (Colemine Records), a collection of raw, emotive soul tunes that critics praised as proof that classic soul aesthetics could feel vivid and contemporary rather than merely retro.[2][6][3]

Finnigan’s solo work and productions showcase a deep love of the golden era of 1960s and 1970s soul and R&B—Chicago soul, Muscle Shoals, Northern Soul, and orchestrated soul—filtered through his experience with hip‑hop sampling and modern studio craft.[7][8] His vocals have been described as weightless yet gritty and intensely emotional, drawing comparisons to singers like Joe Cocker and aligning him with the soul‑revival lineage of Sharon Jones, Charles Bradley, and Lee Fields.[3][1][7] With subsequent solo releases—including his 2024 album "A Lover Was Born," widely noted as one of the standout soul albums of that year—Finnigan has solidified his reputation as a once‑in‑a‑generation soul vocalist and a rare auteur who writes, arranges, performs, and produces his own material from the ground up.[4][3][1][5] Alongside his continuing work with Monophonics and Transistor Sound, he is regarded as a central figure in the current soul movement, balancing reverence for vintage sounds with a personal, emotionally direct songwriting voice that continues to influence the modern “retro soul” landscape.[1][4][8]

## Musical Connections

### Mentors/Influences
- [[mike_finnigan|Mike Finnigan]] - Kelly’s father, a veteran keyboardist and singer who played with major rock and soul artists and served as Kelly’s biggest inspiration and musical role model. (Mike Finnigan’s touring and recording work with Jimi Hendrix, Joe Cocker, Bonnie Raitt and others formed the musical environment Kelly grew up in, and Kelly later dedicated deeply personal work to processing his father’s passing.) [Lifelong influence; particularly formative from Kelly’s childhood in the 1980s–1990s through Mike Finnigan’s death in 2021.[3][6][7]]
- [[isaac_hayes_and_curtis_mayfield_stylistic_influences|Isaac Hayes and Curtis Mayfield (stylistic influences)]] - Key conceptual and sonic inspirations for Kelly’s songwriting and production approach, especially on his album "A Lover Was Born." (Kelly has cited the cinematic arrangements, grooves, and narrative soul style of Hayes and Mayfield as models for the mood, orchestration, and storytelling on "A Lover Was Born.") [Cited explicitly as influences during the conception and production of "A Lover Was Born" (around 2023–2024). [7]]
- [[jerry_ragovoy_and_thom_bell_production_influences|Jerry Ragovoy and Thom Bell (production influences)]] - Vintage soul producers whose dramatic, orchestrated production style Kelly consciously channels on certain tracks. (Kelly notes that one of the songs on "A Lover Was Born" was directly inspired by Ragovoy and Bell’s tough, dramatic, string‑ and horn‑driven soul productions.) [Referenced specifically in discussion of songs written for "A Lover Was Born" (early 2020s). [7]]
- [[syl_johnson_carl_hall_and_lee_moses_vocal_influences|Syl Johnson, Carl Hall, and Lee Moses (vocal influences)]] - Singers whose emotionally intense, gritty vocal deliveries inform Kelly’s own performance style.

[Articulated as influences during the writing and recording of "A Lover Was Born" (early 2020s). [7]]
- [[hiphop_djs_and_producers__dj_culture|Hip‑hop DJs and producers / DJ culture]] - As a teenager, Kelly was shaped by hip‑hop, DJing, beat‑making, and sampling culture, which informed his rhythmic sensibilities and studio approach. (His early work with the production crew Destruments and his later soul recordings—some of which integrate hip‑hop‑inspired beats and textures—reflect this foundation.) [From his early teens (around age 12–13) through his early production career in the 2000s. [5][7]]
