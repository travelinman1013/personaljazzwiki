## Biography
Robert Nighthawk, born Robert Lee McCollum on November 30, 1909, in Helena, Arkansas, was a pioneering blues guitarist and singer whose influence extended across the Delta and beyond. Raised in a musical family, he first learned harmonica before mastering the guitar, picking up his distinctive slide technique from Houston Stackhouse in Mississippi. His early years were marked by constant travel throughout the South, playing at dances, parties, and juke joints, and he was known for his restless nature and frequent changes of address, name, and even marital status.

Nighthawk began recording under the name Robert Lee McCoy in the late 1930s, collaborating with notable musicians such as Big Joe Williams, Sonny Boy Williamson, and Henry Townsend. His 1937 recording "Prowling Night-Hawk" would later inspire his best-known stage name. Throughout the 1940s and 1950s, Nighthawk became renowned for his cool, composed vocal style and his innovative, fluid slide guitar sound, which he achieved using a brass slide. He recorded for labels like Victor, Bluebird, Decca, and later Chess, producing influential tracks such as "Annie Lee Blues," "Black Angel Blues," and "Crying Won't Help You." Despite his talent, Nighthawk's commercial success was limited, partly due to his itinerant lifestyle and sporadic recording sessions.

Nighthawk's legacy is profound: he was a major influence on the Chicago blues scene and inspired a generation of guitarists, including Muddy Waters, B.B. King, Earl Hooker, and Elmore James. His music bridged the rural Delta style and the electrified urban blues that would shape modern blues and rock. Inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1983, Nighthawk remains celebrated for his artistry and contributions to blues history.
