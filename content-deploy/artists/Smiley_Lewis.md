## Biography
Smiley Lewis, born Overton Amos Lemons on July 5, 1913, in DeQuincy, Louisiana, was a pivotal figure in New Orleans rhythm and blues. He moved to New Orleans in his mid-teens, where he adopted the surname Lewis from a white family he lived with. Lewis began his career playing in clubs in the French Quarter, often accompanied by pianist Isidore 'Tuts' Washington. His early performances included stints with Thomas Jefferson's Dixieland band and later with Kid Ernest Molière's band during World War II. Lewis's powerful voice and guitar skills quickly gained him a loyal following, leading to his first recording session with DeLuxe Records in 1947 and a subsequent signing with Imperial Records in 1950. His hits included 'The Bells Are Ringing' and 'I Hear You Knocking,' showcasing his evolving style within the New Orleans R&B scene. Despite his success, Lewis's popularity was sometimes overshadowed by other artists, such as Fats Domino, who covered some of his songs. Lewis passed away on October 7, 1966, leaving behind a legacy as a pioneer of New Orleans R&B. His music remains a testament to the vibrant musical heritage of the city, blending boogie-woogie, doo-wop, and blues elements. Lewis's contributions to the genre have been recognized through various compilations and tributes, highlighting his enduring influence on later musicians.
