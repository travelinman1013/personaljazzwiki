## Biography
Hurray for the Riff Raff is an American band formed in New Orleans in 2007 by Alynda Segarra, a singer-songwriter from the Bronx, New York. Born and raised in the Bronx by their aunt and uncle, Segarra is of Puerto Rican heritage and developed an early appreciation for doo-wop and Motown music. They became radicalized before their teenage years, immersed in the anti-war movement and galvanized by New York's hardcore punk scene at venues like ABC No Rio. At age 17, Segarra left home and spent years crisscrossing North America by hitchhiking and hopping freight trains, eventually becoming part of the Dead Man Street Orchestra, a hobo band documented by Time magazine in 2007.

Segarra found their spiritual and physical home in New Orleans around 2007, where they joined a community of street musicians and formed Hurray for the Riff Raff. Starting with washboard, then banjo, and finally guitar, Segarra released their first self-titled album "It Don't Mean I Don't Love You" in 2008, followed by "Young Blood Blues" in 2010. The band gained early recognition when their track "Daniella" was featured on HBO's "Treme" in 2011. Their sound evolved from folk and blues roots to include more diverse influences, with albums like "Look Out Mama" (2012) produced by Andrija Tokic and "The Navigator" (2017) on ATO Records, which addressed themes of Puerto Rican identity and displacement.

In recent years, Segarra has continued to push creative boundaries. Their 2022 album "Life on Earth" on Nonesuch Records introduced a "nature punk" sound focused on themes of survival and thriving amid environmental crisis, earning critical acclaim from outlets like Stereogum. Their eighth studio album "The Past Is Still Alive" was released in February 2024 and was praised by the Associated Press as a "beautiful portrayal of the U.S.," drawing on Segarra's experiences as a hitchhiker, train hopper, and outsider artist. Throughout their career, Segarra has remained a fixture of the modern folk movement while expanding the scope of American storytelling to encompass outsiders and marginalized communities.
