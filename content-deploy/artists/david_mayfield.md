## Biography
David Mayfield is an American guitarist, vocalist, songwriter, and Grammy-nominated producer, renowned for his dynamic stage presence and eclectic approach to Americana and bluegrass music. Born on January 20, 1983, in Kent, Ohio, Mayfield was immersed in music from an early age, touring with his family’s bluegrass band, One Way Rider, alongside his parents and his younger sister, Jessica Lea Mayfield. Living much of his childhood on the road, even in one of Bill Monroe’s old tour buses, he quickly developed his instrumental skills, particularly on bass, guitar, and mandolin, earning national awards as a teenager for his dexterity.

Mayfield’s career evolved as he played with notable bluegrass and Americana acts such as The Larkins, Hit & Run Bluegrass, and Dave Evans, before joining Cadillac Sky, where he contributed as a songwriter and performer. After Cadillac Sky’s dissolution, he launched The David Mayfield Parade, a project that blended bluegrass roots with pop and indie folk influences, and gained acclaim for its energetic live shows and heartfelt songwriting. Mayfield has collaborated with prominent artists like The Avett Brothers, Mumford & Sons, and The Black Keys, and his work is characterized by a blend of sincerity, humor, and showmanship. In recent years, he has returned to his bluegrass roots, recording new material in Nashville and continuing to tour widely, cementing his reputation as both a skilled musician and a compelling entertainer.
