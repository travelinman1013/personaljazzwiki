## Biography
Tom Jones was born Thomas John Woodward on June 7, 1940, in Pontypridd, Wales, where he began singing at an early age in church and school choirs.[1] After leaving school at 15, he worked various manual jobs while singing in clubs at night, and married at 17, starting a family that would ground him throughout his life.[1][4] His breakthrough came in 1963 when Gordon Mills, a London-based manager and songwriter, discovered him performing in South Wales clubs, recognized his potential, and renamed him Tom Jones after the Henry Fielding novel.[1][3] Mills secured him a record deal with Decca Records, and in 1965, Jones released "It's Not Unusual," a song penned by Mills that became his signature hit and launched him to international stardom.[1][2][3]

Throughout the 1960s, Jones dominated the swinging London music scene with a string of chart hits including "What's New, Pussycat?," "Green, Green Grass of Home," and "Delilah," establishing himself as a sex symbol with a fantastic voice and raucous stage presence.[1] He moved to the United States in the late 1960s, where his variety show *This Is Tom Jones* aired from 1969 to 1971, and he subsequently conquered Las Vegas beginning in the 1970s with steady performances at major hotels like Caesars Palace and the Flamingo.[1] During this Vegas era, his female fans famously threw their underwear onto the stage, creating a philandering ladies' man reputation that became part of his legend.[1]

Jones experienced a remarkable career renaissance beginning in the late 1980s when he collaborated with synth-pop group Art of Noise on a reimagined version of Prince's "Kiss" in 1988, introducing him to a new generation.[1][3] His 1999 album *Reload*, featuring collaborations with contemporary artists like Robbie Williams, The Cardigans, and Stereophonics, became the biggest-selling album of his career and earned him a Brit Award for Best British Male in 2000.[3] He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 2006 for his services to music and became a judge on the UK version of *The Voice* from 2012-2015 and again from 2017 onward, where his warmth and decades of experience endeared him to contestants and audiences.[1][3] His legacy spans over five decades of sustained popularity across multiple musical styles, from pop and soul to country and rock, with his 41st studio album *Surrounded by Time* released in 2021.[1]

## Fun Facts
- During his Las Vegas performances in the 1970s, female fans began throwing their underwear onto the stage, a phenomenon that became so iconic it defined his public image for decades, despite Jones being married to the same woman until her death in April 2016.[1]
- Jones was so desperate to record "It's Not Unusual" that he reportedly told his manager Gordon Mills, "If I don't do this song, I'm going to give up the business, and I might even kill myself" — the song became his breakthrough hit and signature track.[5]
- He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 2006 for his services to music, earning the title Sir Tom Jones, and published his autobiography *Over the Top and Back* in 2015 at age 75.[1][3]
- Jones has released 41 studio albums throughout his career, demonstrating remarkable longevity and willingness to reinvent himself across multiple musical genres from pop and soul to country and rock.[1]
