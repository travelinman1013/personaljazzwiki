## Biography
Charles Frank 'Chuck' Mangione (November 29, 1940 – July 22, 2025) was born and raised in Rochester, New York, where he developed his musical talents early on, playing trumpet alongside his pianist brother Gap in the mainstream jazz group the Jazz Brothers, which recorded three albums for Riverside Records. He attended the Eastman School of Music from 1958 to 1963, graduating with a bachelor's degree in music education, and began playing flugelhorn there; he later returned as faculty, directing the Jazz Ensemble and teaching improvisation. Mangione rose to prominence in the 1960s as a trumpeter with Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers, succeeding luminaries like Clifford Brown, Freddie Hubbard, and Lee Morgan, and also performed with bands led by Woody Herman and Maynard Ferguson.[1][2][4][5]

Transitioning to a solo career, Mangione achieved commercial breakthrough in the 1970s with his quartet featuring saxophonist Gerry Niewood, releasing over 30 albums blending jazz, jazz fusion, and pop elements, often characterized by his signature flugelhorn sound in the smooth jazz and yacht rock styles. Key successes included the 1977 Grammy-winning instrumental 'Bellavia' (Best Instrumental Composition), the mega-hit 'Feels So Good' (1978), which became one of the best-selling jazz records ever, and Olympic themes like 'Chase the Clouds Away' (1976 Montreal Summer Games) and 'Give It All You Got' (1980 Winter Olympics). He composed film scores for Fargo (1996), Zombieland (2009), and Doctor Strange (2016), and recorded live albums like Friends and Love (1970) with the Rochester Philharmonic Orchestra, earning 13 Grammy nominations and two wins.[1][2][4][5][6]

Mangione's legacy endures as a pioneer of smooth jazz crossover, influencing the genre's popularity while maintaining jazz roots; he hosted major benefits like the 1980 Italian Earthquake Relief concert with Dizzy Gillespie and Chick Corea, and his return to performing after Gillespie's 1994 death supported endowments for music education in Rochester. His work with major labels like Mercury propelled hits such as Land of Make Believe, solidifying his global fanbase over five decades.[1][2][4][5]
