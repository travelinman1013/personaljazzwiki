## Biography
Pyeng Threadgill is an American vocalist, songwriter, and producer known for her eclectic blend of blues, jazz, soul, and folk influences. Born on November 14, 1977, in New York City to renowned jazz composer Henry Threadgill and dancer/choreographer Christina Jones, Pyeng was immersed in a creative environment from an early age. She attended Oberlin Conservatory of Music, where she studied classical music and graduated with a BA in Music, later receiving a Mellon Fellowship to study music in Brazil. Her early exposure to avant-garde dance and theater, combined with her formal musical education, laid the foundation for her genre-blurring artistry.[2][7]

Threadgill's career began in earnest in the early 2000s, marked by the release of her debut album 'Sweet Home: Pyeng Threadgill Sings Robert Johnson' in 2004, which reimagined Delta blues classics with a contemporary, soulful twist. She continued to evolve her sound with albums like 'Of The Air' and 'Portholes To A Love & Other Short Stories,' the latter inspired by literary works and earning her a New York Foundation for the Arts award in music composition. Her projects often explore themes of ancestry, identity, and empowerment, as seen in her multimedia album 'Head Full of Hair, Heart Full of Song,' which delves into the cultural significance of Black hair and self-expression. Threadgill is also a respected educator, voice and movement teacher, and has performed internationally at major festivals and venues.[1][2][4]

Known for her 'New Porch Music,' Threadgill crafts intimate musical journeys that fuse folk, jazz, Afro-electronic, and improvisational elements. Her work is characterized by a commitment to storytelling, healing, and social reflection, making her a unique voice in contemporary American music. She continues to inspire audiences with her innovative approach and dedication to artistic exploration.[1][4]
