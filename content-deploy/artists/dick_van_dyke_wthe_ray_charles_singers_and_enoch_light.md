## Biography
“Dick Van Dyke w/The Ray Charles Singers & Enoch Light” is not a separate artist or standing group, but a specific billing used for the 1963 LP *Songs I Like by Dick Van Dyke*, recorded with **Enoch Light and His Orchestra** and **The Ray Charles Singers** on Command Records.[3][5][7] The project was conceived as a studio album showcasing Dick Van Dyke’s light, conversational vocal style on standards and show‐tune–leaning material, framed by the polished, hi‑fidelity arranging and production that made Enoch Light and Command Records notable in the early 1960s.[1][3][7] It appeared at the height of Van Dyke’s early stardom off Broadway’s *Bye Bye Birdie* and TV’s *The Dick Van Dyke Show*, extending his image as a song‑and‑dance entertainer into the LP market.[3][5][6]

The album placed Van Dyke’s charming, “non‑singer” character vocals against Enoch Light’s tight studio orchestra and the smooth, pop‑choral textures of The Ray Charles Singers, a vocal group led by arranger and conductor Ray Charles (the white bandleader, not the soul pianist‑singer).[1][4] Critics and later commentators have described the record as upbeat, jazzy, and rooted in Tin Pan Alley and Broadway idioms rather than soul or R&B, even though streaming platforms sometimes tag it with broader retro genres.[1][3][4] While not a major commercial milestone in its own right, the collaboration documents the cross‑pollination between early‑’60s television celebrities and the sophisticated Easy Listening/“hi‑fi” studio scene, adding a distinctive entry to Dick Van Dyke’s discography and to the catalogs of both Enoch Light and The Ray Charles Singers.[3][5][7]

More broadly, the project reflects each participant’s established strengths: Van Dyke’s affable, rhythmic delivery developed in stage musicals and variety work; Light’s reputation for meticulous stereo production and brass‑and‑woodwind‑rich orchestrations; and The Ray Charles Singers’ trademark smooth ensemble vocals heard on radio, television, and numerous pop and Easy Listening releases.[1][3][4][7] Together, they created a period piece of early‑1960s American popular entertainment, remembered today as a cult favorite among collectors of Command Records and fans of Van Dyke’s musical side rather than as the work of a permanent band under the composite name.

Because of this, “Dick Van Dyke w/The Ray Charles Singers & Enoch Light” is best understood as a **one‑off collaborative credit on a studio album**, not as a long‑running band or independent artist with its own autonomous history.[3][5][7]
