## Biography
Arthur S. Taylor Jr. (April 6, 1929 – February 6, 1995) was an American jazz drummer who helped define the sound of modern jazz drumming during the 1950s and 1960s. Born and raised in New York City, Taylor's musical journey began as a teenager after hearing drummer Big Sid Catlett perform at a jam session at what is now the Lincoln Center. He quickly immersed himself in the New York bebop scene, playing with fellow teenagers Sonny Rollins, Jackie McLean, and Kenny Drew. His first professional gig came in 1948 with Howard McGhee, launching a career that would see him collaborate with virtually every major figure in modern jazz, including Charlie Parker, John Coltrane, Miles Davis, Thelonious Monk, Bud Powell, and Coleman Hawkins.

Taylor's career took a significant turn in 1956 when he formed his own group, Taylor's Wailers, recording their debut album in 1957 at Van Gelder Studio with an all-star lineup including Donald Byrd, Jackie McLean, and Charlie Rouse. In 1963, disillusioned with the racial and political climate in the United States, Taylor moved to Europe where he spent 17 years living primarily in France and Belgium. During this period, he performed with both European musicians and visiting American expatriates like Dexter Gordon and Johnny Griffin, while also studying drums with Kenny Clarke in Paris. Taylor's 1977 book "Notes and Tones" became a groundbreaking work in jazz literature, featuring candid interviews with major musicians that addressed social, political, and economic issues rarely discussed in mainstream jazz coverage.

Taylor returned to the United States in the 1980s to care for his ill mother and continued performing, organizing a second iteration of Taylor's Wailers in 1991. His final recordings included the 1992 live album "Wailin' At The Vanguard" and a 1995 session with Jimmy Smith on the album "Damn!" which was dedicated to his memory after his death on February 6, 1995. Throughout his career, Taylor was known for his reliability, professionalism, and his role as a mentor to younger musicians, helping establish the fundamental sound and approach of modern jazz drumming alongside contemporaries Art Blakey, Max Roach, and Philly Joe Jones.

## Fun Facts
- Taylor was a professional musician for over 10 years before he learned to read music, relying entirely on his ear and natural talent during his early career.
- He was self-proclaimed as 'the most prolific drummer in modern jazz history' and proudly stated 'I NEVER was late!' emphasizing his legendary reliability and professionalism.
- After publishing 'Notes and Tones' in 1977, people assumed Taylor could no longer play drums well, which only motivated him to play better than ever before in his life.
