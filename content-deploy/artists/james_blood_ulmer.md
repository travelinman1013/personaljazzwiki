## Biography
James 'Blood' Ulmer, born Willie James Ulmer on February 8, 1940, in St. Matthews, South Carolina, is a pioneering American guitarist, singer, and composer whose work bridges the worlds of free jazz, avant-garde, blues, and jazz fusion. Raised in a deeply religious Baptist family, Ulmer's earliest musical experiences came from singing and playing guitar in his father's gospel quartet, the Southern Sons, during the late 1940s and early 1950s. His musical journey began in earnest after moving to Pittsburgh in 1959, where he performed with R&B and jazz groups, absorbing influences from the chitlin' circuit and learning from established musicians such as Chuck Edwards and a young George Benson. 

Ulmer's career took a decisive turn in the early 1970s when he moved to New York and met saxophonist Ornette Coleman, whose harmolodic theory profoundly shaped Ulmer's approach to music. As the first electric guitarist to record and tour extensively with Coleman, Ulmer developed a highly individualistic style that merged the raw soulfulness of Delta blues with the improvisational freedom of avant-garde jazz. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Ulmer released a series of acclaimed albums, including 'Tales of Captain Black,' 'Free Lancing,' 'Black Rock,' and 'Odyssey,' and led influential ensembles such as the Music Revelation Ensemble and Odyssey the Band. 

Ulmer's legacy is defined by his genre-defying artistry and his role as a bridge between jazz, blues, funk, and rock. He is often described as a missing link between Jimi Hendrix and Wes Montgomery, and his innovative guitar work and vocal style have inspired generations of musicians. Even into the 21st century, Ulmer remains an elder statesman of the blues, continuing to perform, record, and push musical boundaries.
