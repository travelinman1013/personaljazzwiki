## Biography
The Nick Moran Trio is led by guitarist Nick Moran, a New York City native who began his musical journey on the trumpet at age ten before switching to guitar at thirteen. Moran pursued formal studies in jazz, earning a BFA in Jazz Performance from the City College of New York, where he was a protégé of legendary bassist Ron Carter. His early musical influences included jazz greats such as Grant Green, Wes Montgomery, and Lee Ritenour, shaping his articulate and imaginative playing style.[1][3][8]

Moran's career has been marked by a deep commitment to jazz both as a performer and educator. He fronts his own organ trio, the Nick Moran Trio, which has released acclaimed albums such as 'No Time Like Now' (2012), noted for its melodic inventiveness and rhythmic drive.[6][8] Moran is recognized for his transparent articulation and logical improvisation, and he regularly conducts master classes in rhythm studies and improvisation. Beyond jazz, Moran is a multi-instrumentalist, exploring folk, blues, and Irish music on instruments like mandolin, ukulele, fiddle, and Irish bouzouki.[1]

The Nick Moran Trio’s music is rooted in classic jazz traditions but is distinguished by its groove-oriented approach and modern sensibility. Moran’s compositions and performances reflect a blend of influences, from hard bop to soul jazz, and his work has contributed to the ongoing vitality of the jazz organ trio format. His legacy includes both his recorded output and his impact as a teacher and mentor to younger musicians.[1][6][8]
