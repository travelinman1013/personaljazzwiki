## Biography
Antônio Moreira da Silva, widely known as **Moreira da Silva** or by his nickname **Kid Morengueira**, was a pioneering Brazilian samba singer, songwriter and guitarist, born on 1 April 1902 in Rio de Janeiro and passing away in the same city on 6 June 2000.[5][6][4] He grew up in deep poverty and only began his professional musical life around the age of 20, entering the world of samba and composition in the 1920s.[3] Early on, he absorbed the rhythms and language of Rio’s popular neighborhoods, which would shape his lifelong identification with the malandro (streetwise hustler) figure common in urban Brazilian culture.[3][4]

From the 1930s onward, Moreira da Silva became one of the most distinctive voices in samba, particularly associated with the subgenre later called **samba‑de‑breque**, characterized by comic or dramatic spoken interjections that interrupt the sung narrative.[3][4] His persona as Kid Morengueira, a witty, roguish character who talked his way in and out of trouble, turned his recordings and stage performances into theatrical monologues over syncopated samba grooves, influencing how narrative and humor were integrated into popular Brazilian song.[3][4] Over several decades he recorded widely, remained active into old age, and came to be regarded as an iconic representative of Rio’s traditional samba culture, bridging the early 20th‑century roots of the genre with later generations of sambistas.[5][6]

His legacy rests not only on his longevity but on his role in codifying a style that mixed storytelling, spoken word, and samba rhythm in a uniquely Brazilian form. Later historians and musicians frequently cite him as a central figure in the development of narrative samba, and his recordings continue to be referenced as classics of the genre in discographic and musicological sources.[3][5][6] Through his work, the image of the sambista-malandro, half comic and half critical social observer, became a lasting archetype in Brazilian popular music.[3][4]
