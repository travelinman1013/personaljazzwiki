## Biography
Johnny 'Guitar' Watson was born John Watson Jr. on February 3, 1935, in Houston, Texas, into a musical family—his father was a pianist and his grandfather a preacher and guitarist. Watson's early exposure to music came through his father's piano lessons and his grandfather's church guitar, but it was the electric guitar, inspired by Texas blues legends like T-Bone Walker and Clarence 'Gatemouth' Brown, that truly captivated him. By age 11, he was playing guitar, and as a teenager, he performed alongside local blues greats such as Albert Collins and Johnny Copeland in Houston's vibrant blues scene.[2][3][4][5][6]

After his parents separated in 1950, Watson moved with his mother to Los Angeles, where he quickly established himself in the city's jump blues and jazz clubs. He began recording professionally in the early 1950s, initially billed as 'Young John Watson.' In 1954, inspired by the Joan Crawford film 'Johnny Guitar,' he adopted the stage name that would become iconic. Watson's career spanned over four decades, evolving from blues and R&B in the 1950s and 1960s to a pioneering funk sound in the 1970s, with hits like 'Ain't That a Bitch,' 'Superman Lover,' and 'A Real Mother For Ya.' His flamboyant showmanship, innovative guitar techniques—including early use of feedback and reverb—and witty, socially conscious lyrics made him a standout figure in American popular music.[1][4][5][6]

Watson's legacy is profound: he was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame and remains celebrated as a foundational influence on blues, funk, and soul. His music has been widely sampled by hip-hop artists, and his style inspired generations of guitarists and vocalists. Despite never achieving mainstream superstardom, Watson's impact endures through the artists he influenced and the genre-defying body of work he left behind.[1][5][6]
