## Biography
Wes Montgomery, born John Leslie Montgomery on March 6, 1923 (some sources cite 1925) in Indianapolis, Indiana, emerged as one of the most influential jazz guitarists of the 20th century. Largely self-taught, he began playing guitar at 19, quickly mastering the solos of his idol Charlie Christian. Montgomery's early career included a stint with Lionel Hampton's orchestra from 1948 to 1950, after which he returned to Indianapolis, balancing factory work by day and club gigs by night, often performing with his brothers Buddy and Monk.

Montgomery's breakthrough came in the late 1950s when Cannonball Adderley discovered him, leading to a contract with Riverside Records. His recordings from 1959 to 1963, such as 'The Incredible Jazz Guitar of Wes Montgomery' and 'Full House,' showcased his innovative use of octaves, thumb-picked technique, and melodic improvisation. In the mid-1960s, he transitioned to Verve and A&M Records, where producer Creed Taylor helped him reach broader audiences with orchestrated albums like 'A Day in the Life.' Despite commercial success, Montgomery remained rooted in jazz, performing in small groups and with his brothers until his untimely death from a heart attack on June 15, 1968.

Montgomery's legacy is defined by his warm tone, lyrical phrasing, and unique solo structure—moving from single-note lines to octaves and then to block chords. He profoundly influenced generations of guitarists and helped shape the sound of modern jazz guitar, leaving an indelible mark on both jazz and popular music.
