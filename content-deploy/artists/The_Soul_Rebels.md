## Biography
The Soul Rebels, an eight-piece New Orleans brass ensemble, originated from the collaboration of percussionists Derrick Moss and Lumar LeBlanc, who met while playing in Harold Dejan's Young Olympia Brass Band.  Inspired by the pop music they heard on the radio, they sought to integrate those sounds into the rich tradition of New Orleans brass and marching bands they knew.  Initially performing around New Orleans without a formal name, Cyril Neville christened them "The Soul Rebels" after a performance at Tipitina's.  They established a strong local following through a Thursday night residency at Le Bon Temps Roule, a venue they still play when not touring.

Their career quickly expanded beyond New Orleans.  Since 2009, they've been managed by Ted Kurland Associates, Hep Cat Entertainment, and Blue Note Entertainment Group.  The Soul Rebels' eclectic live shows, blending soul, jazz, funk, hip-hop, rock, and pop, led to collaborations with a diverse range of artists, including Katy Perry, Nas, Metallica, Green Day, Macklemore & Ryan Lewis, and many others.  Significant performances include appearances on various television networks (CBS, Travel Channel, Discovery Channel, HBO, TBS, NBC, NPR, ESPN, BBC Two, The CW), major film appearances, and performances at numerous music festivals worldwide.  They've also shared stages with Lauryn Hill, Kanye West, Bruno Mars, Snoop Dogg, and numerous others.  The band's high-energy performances, averaging over 250 shows annually, have solidified their reputation.  In 2011, they played to 50,000 people at the Montreal Jazz Festival.  Notable collaborations include a performance with Metallica at their 30th-anniversary concerts and appearances at Stella McCartney's fashion presentation and Brad Pitt's charity event.  They also released a mixtape, *Power = Power*, in 2013, which received critical acclaim and won an Offbeat's Best Of The Beat Award.  Their album *Unlock Your Mind* (2012) reached No. 5 on the iTunes Jazz charts and was the No. 1 most added album on CMJ magazine's Hip-Hop playlists.

The Soul Rebels' musical style is a unique fusion of genres, described by the Village Voice as "the missing link between Public Enemy and Louis Armstrong."  Their innovative approach to incorporating elements of hip-hop and pop into a traditional New Orleans brass band framework has garnered them significant recognition and awards, including multiple Best Of The Beat Awards and New Orleans' Big Easy awards.  Their extensive touring across the US, Canada, Europe, South Africa, and Brazil, along with their consistent presence at major festivals, has cemented their legacy as a dynamic and influential force in contemporary music.  Their performances on television shows like *Conan*, *The Andrew Marr Show*, and *Later with Jools Holland*, as well as their appearances in films like *The Hungry Rabbit Jumps* and *Treme*, further showcase their broad appeal and impact.  In 2023, they contributed to the soundtrack of the film *Haunted Mansion*.
