## Biography
Mike LeDonne, born Michael Arthur LeDonne on October 26, 1956, in Bridgeport, Connecticut, grew up in his parents' music store, where his father, a jazz guitarist, introduced him to music from an early age. Starting piano at age five and performing locally by ten, he studied with John Mehegan and later Jaki Byard at the New England Conservatory of Music, graduating in 1978 before moving to New York City to join the Widespread Depression Jazz Orchestra. His early career included stints with swing masters like Benny Goodman, Roy Eldridge, and Panama Francis, transitioning to house pianist at Jimmy Ryan's, where he played with legends such as Papa Jo Jones and Vic Dickenson.[1][4]

LeDonne's career evolved through bebop and hard bop, notably spending over a decade (around 1987-1999) with Milt Jackson's Quartet as pianist, composer, and musical director, followed by long-term collaborations with Benny Golson since 1997 and others like Sonny Rollins, Art Farmer, and Bobby Hutcherson. In 2000, he formed the Groover Quartet—featuring himself on Hammond organ, tenor saxophonist Eric Alexander, guitarist Peter Bernstein, and drummer Joe Farnsworth—born from a weekly Tuesday night residency at New York City's Smoke Jazz Club that lasted nearly 20 years until COVID-19. This organ-led group, emphasizing hard bop and soul jazz grooves, recorded multiple albums for Savant Records, toured internationally, and elevated his organ reputation, earning him DownBeat's 'Rising Star' organ poll win and Jazz Journalists Association nominations.[1][3][4][5]

Known for his versatile style blending swing, bebop, and organ grooves influenced by Jimmy Smith, LeDonne has led over 25 albums, appeared on 200+ recordings, and teaches at William Paterson University. His legacy includes bridging jazz eras, from swing masters to modern innovators, while his Groover Quartet remains a staple, as seen in recent releases like the 2024 gospel-infused 'Wonderful' on Cellar Music.[2][6]
