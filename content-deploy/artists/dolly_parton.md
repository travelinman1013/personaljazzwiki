## Biography
Dolly Parton, born January 19, 1946, in Locust Ridge, Tennessee, emerged from humble beginnings as the fourth of twelve children in a poor Appalachian family. Surrounded by music from an early age—her mother sang and played guitar, and her family often performed together—Parton began writing songs as a child and made her first public performances in church. By age 10, she was performing on local radio and television in Knoxville, and at 13, she made her debut at the Grand Ole Opry, where Johnny Cash encouraged her to pursue her own musical path.

After graduating high school, Parton moved to Nashville in 1964, quickly establishing herself as a songwriter and performer. Her big break came as the protégée of Porter Wagoner, with whom she recorded numerous hit duets and gained national exposure through his television show. Parton's solo career flourished in the 1970s with iconic songs like 'Jolene,' 'I Will Always Love You,' and later crossover hits such as '9 to 5' and 'Islands in the Stream.' Her musical style blends traditional country, Appalachian folk, gospel, and pop, characterized by her distinctive soprano, heartfelt storytelling, and wit.

Parton's legacy extends far beyond music: she is a prolific songwriter with over 3,000 compositions, a successful businesswoman, philanthropist, and cultural icon. Her influence on country music and popular culture is profound, inspiring generations of artists and earning her a place in the Country Music Hall of Fame and numerous other honors.
