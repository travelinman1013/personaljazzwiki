## Biography
The Olympia Brass Band was founded in 1958 by alto saxophonist Harold "Duke" Dejan (1909-2002), who had been playing jazz and brass band music since the 1920s. The band quickly became one of the most prominent brass bands in New Orleans from the 1960s to the 1980s, serving as a bridge between traditional New Orleans brass band music and more contemporary sounds. Under Dejan's leadership, the twelve-piece ensemble initially played traditional repertoire in the style of earlier brass bands like Eureka, Onward, and Tuxedo, but began modernizing their approach when trumpeter and co-leader Milton Battiste joined in 1962.

Olympia Brass Band was revolutionary in opening up the brass band tradition to new audiences and contexts. They were the first brass band to tour extensively, beginning in the late 1960s, and expanded their performance venues beyond traditional parades and funerals to include nightclubs, Preservation Hall, television commercials, and sporting events. The band toured internationally, performing in Europe and Africa, playing for Queen Elizabeth's 25th wedding anniversary in London, and entertaining Pope John Paul during his visit to New Orleans. They also broke with tradition by eschewing formal uniforms in favor of matching T-shirts with the band's logo, a change that influenced later bands.

Musically, Olympia was known for their enormous range and flexibility, seamlessly transitioning from modest traditional styles for funerals and tourist concerts to more progressive sounds incorporating rhythm & blues influences from artists like Fats Domino and Professor Longhair for second line parades. This adaptability and willingness to incorporate contemporary popular music styles paved the way for later innovative bands like Dirty Dozen and Rebirth. The band continued performing into the late 1990s and early 2000s, with their final notable performance being Harold Dejan's own funeral parade in 2002.
