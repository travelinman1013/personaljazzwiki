## Biography
Larry Young, born Larry John McCoy on October 7, 1940, in Newark, New Jersey, to Agnes McCoy and professional organist Larry Young Sr., began his musical journey tutored on piano by his grandfather before formal studies with Olga Von Till, a student of Béla Bartók who also taught Bill Evans. At age eleven, he formed the vocal group The Challengers, modeled on the Mills Brothers, and by 1954, his father opened The Shindig club, exposing him to organ playing in jazz and R&B contexts at Newark venues like Sugar Hill Club. Starting with soul jazz and hard bop influences in the late 1950s, Young debuted as a leader with Prestige Records' *Testifying* in 1960, followed by *Young Blues* and *Groove Street*, establishing his early funky style.[1][2][3][6]

Transitioning to Blue Note in 1964, Young's style evolved radically on *Into Somethin'*, blending post-bop, modal jazz, and avant-garde elements, moving beyond Jimmy Smith's soul jazz template toward freer improvisation. His masterpiece *Unity* (1966) featured Joe Henderson, Woody Shaw, and Elvin Jones, showcasing innovative Hammond B-3 use. He briefly joined John Coltrane's group in 1965-1966, replacing McCoy Tyner, then pioneered jazz fusion with Tony Williams Lifetime alongside John McLaughlin in the early 1970s, recording albums like *Emergency!* and contributing to Miles Davis's *Bitches Brew* sessions. Later works included *Lawrence of Newark* (1973) and Arista releases *Larry Young's Fuel* (1975) and *Spaceball* (1976).[1][2][3][5]

Young's legacy as the organist who 'reinvented the Hammond B-3' endures despite his untimely death on March 30, 1978, at age 37 in East Orange, New Jersey, officially from pneumonia amid unexplained circumstances following stomach pains. His visionary fusion of soul jazz, free jazz, bebop, and fusion continues to inspire, marked by genres like hard bop, soul jazz, free jazz, and bebop per Spotify data.[1][2][3]
