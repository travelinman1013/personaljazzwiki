- **Origin**: United States (American jazz, blues and funk group; more specific city of origin is not clearly documented in reliable sources)

## Biography
Bluesiana Triangle was a short‑lived but distinctive American **jazz, blues, and funk** group formed around 1990, originally as a studio and touring vehicle for drummer **Art Blakey**, pianist/singer **Dr. John (Mac Rebennack)**, and saxophonist/flutist **David “Fathead” Newman**.[2][4] The group’s name reflected the blend of New Orleans R&B and blues (via Dr. John), Texas and soul‑jazz saxophone (via Newman), and hard bop jazz (via Blakey), creating a hybrid idiom critics often described as a spirited collision of Crescent City grooves with modern jazz improvisation.[2][4][6] Their first album, *Bluesiana Triangle*, recorded for Windham Hill’s jazz imprint and released in 1990, captured this mix through originals and reworked standards and effectively served as both Art Blakey’s late‑career roots project and a celebration of his chemistry with two much younger bandmates.[4][6]

After Blakey’s death in 1990, Bluesiana Triangle continued as an ensemble project led by **Dr. John and David “Fathead” Newman**, returning to the studio to record *Bluesiana II* (also issued by Windham Hill Jazz, recorded in 1991 and released in 1992) with a revised lineup that emphasized New Orleans rhythms and blues‑inflected jazz.[5] Though the group never became a long‑term touring institution, the two Bluesiana albums occupy a niche place in the discographies of all three principals: for Blakey, they stand among his final recordings and highlight his openness to fusing hard bop with rootsy funk and blues; for Dr. John and Newman, they document a rare small‑group context where both could stretch out as co‑leaders in a jazz setting while retaining the earthy song forms and grooves of their R&B and blues backgrounds.[2][4][5][6] The project’s legacy is less about a continuous band history and more about these sessions as a high‑level, genre‑crossing summit of three major figures from different corners of African‑American music.

## Fun Facts
- The name "Bluesiana Triangle" is both the title of Art Blakey’s 1990 album and the name of the group itself, underscoring how closely the band and that recording are intertwined.[4]
- Bluesiana Triangle was released on the Windham Hill Jazz imprint—an unusual home for a hard‑swinging, New Orleans‑flavored jazz‑blues project, given the label’s reputation for contemporary and new‑age‑leaning music.[4][6]
- After Art Blakey’s death in 1990, the band name lived on for the follow‑up album *Bluesiana II*, which is officially credited to the Bluesiana Triangle ensemble led by Dr. John and David "Fathead" Newman, effectively turning the original drummer‑led concept into a co‑led project.[4][5]
- Contemporary reviews highlighted the group’s stylistic spread, noting how traditional New Orleans grooves, straight‑ahead jazz, and funk backbeats could coexist within the same set, making the project stand out even in the eclectic early‑1990s jazz landscape.[6]

- [[david_fathead_newman|David "Fathead" Newman]] - Co‑founder, tenor saxophonist and flutist, and later co‑leader; supplied soul‑jazz and Texas tenor influences and shared front‑line duties with Dr. John. (Albums *Bluesiana Triangle* and *Bluesiana II*.) [1990–1992.[2][4][5][6]]
