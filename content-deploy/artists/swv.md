## Biography
SWV, an acronym for Sisters with Voices, is an American R&B vocal trio formed in New York City in 1988. The group originally began as a gospel ensemble, with founding members Cheryl 'Coko' Gamble and Leanne 'Lelee' Lyons, later joined by Tamara 'Taj' Johnson. Their early dedication to crafting a unique sound and relentless pursuit of a record deal—famously sending demo tapes with bottles of Perrier to catch attention—led to their signing with RCA Records in 1991. Their debut album, 'It's About Time' (1992), became a commercial breakthrough, producing a string of top ten R&B hits such as 'Weak,' 'Right Here (Human Nature Remix),' 'I'm So into You,' and 'You're Always on My Mind.' SWV's music blended new jack swing and R&B, characterized by lush harmonies and dynamic vocal performances, quickly establishing them as one of the most successful girl groups of the 1990s.

After a hiatus from 1998 to 2005, during which members pursued solo projects, SWV reunited and continued to perform and record, maintaining their legacy as influential figures in R&B. Their subsequent albums, including 'New Beginning' (1996) and 'Release Some Tension' (1997), featured collaborations with notable producers and artists, further cementing their impact on the genre. With over 25 million records sold worldwide, SWV is recognized as one of the best-selling girl groups of all time, known for their enduring influence and contributions to the evolution of R&B music.
