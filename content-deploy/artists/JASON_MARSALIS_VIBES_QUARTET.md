## Biography
The Jason Marsalis Vibes Quartet is led by Jason Marsalis, a prodigious jazz musician born in 1977 in New Orleans, Louisiana, and the youngest member of the renowned Marsalis family. Jason began his musical journey at age five with the violin, soon moving to drums at six, and performed early on with his father Ellis Marsalis Jr. and in groups such as Casa Samba and Los Hombres Calientes. By the early 2000s, Marsalis had shifted his focus to the vibraphone, gradually developing his unique sound and approach to the instrument.

Marsalis formed the Jason Marsalis Vibes Quartet in the late 2000s, releasing his first vibraphone-led album, 'Music Update,' in 2009, followed by 'In a World of Mallets' in 2013. The quartet, featuring Austin Johnson (piano), Will Goble (bass), and Dave Potter (drums), quickly gained acclaim for their inventive arrangements and Marsalis's multifaceted percussion work, which includes marimba, glockenspiel, and xylophone. The group's music draws from a wide range of jazz traditions, blending original compositions with hidden gems from the jazz repertoire, and has been praised for its playful, spirited, and emotionally engaging performances. Marsalis's dedication to both tradition and innovation has established the quartet as a leading voice in contemporary jazz vibraphone.

The Jason Marsalis Vibes Quartet is noted for its tributes to jazz vibraphone legends such as Lionel Hampton, Milt Jackson, and Bobby Hutcherson, while also pushing the boundaries of the instrument. Marsalis's approach is characterized by rhythmic complexity, melodic inventiveness, and a deep respect for jazz history, making the quartet a vital link between past and present in the jazz world.
