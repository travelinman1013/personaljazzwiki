## Biography
Divine Ikubor, known professionally as **Rema**, is a Nigerian singer, songwriter, and rapper born on 1 May 2000 in Benin City, Edo State, Nigeria.[4][1] Raised in a Christian family and originally from Igbanke in Orhionmwon LGA of Edo State, he began performing in church as a child, rapping, singing, and even forming school and church-based music groups before finishing secondary school at Ighile Group of Schools in Edo State.[4][6] The early loss of his father and later his elder brother placed heavy responsibility on him and pushed him to work to support his family, experiences he has cited as shaping both his character and the emotive edge of his music.[1][4]

Rema’s professional breakthrough came in 2018 when he posted a viral Instagram freestyle over D’Prince’s track “Gucci Gang,” which led D’Prince to fly him to Lagos and sign him to Jonzing World, a subsidiary of Don Jazzy’s Mavin Records, in 2019.[4][3] That same year he released his self‑titled debut EP *Rema*, containing the hit “Dumebi” as well as “Iron Man,” which drew international attention after being included on Barack Obama’s 2019 summer playlist.[1][2][4] Across subsequent EPs and his debut album *Rave & Roses* (2022), he developed a distinctive style that fuses Afrobeats with trap, pop, and other global sounds—an approach he branded **“Afrorave,”** blending Afrobeats with Arabian and Indian influences and helping define a new, youth‑driven edge within the Afrobeats movement.[4][5]

Rema’s global breakthrough arrived with “Calm Down,” first released as a single from *Rave & Roses* and later remixed with American singer Selena Gomez in 2022.[3][2][5] The remix peaked at number 3 on the *Billboard* Hot 100 and spent a record 58 weeks at number 1 on the *Billboard* U.S. Afrobeats Songs chart, becoming one of the most commercially successful Afrobeats records in history and earning him major international awards and nominations.[3][4][5] Critics and industry observers credit him with pushing Afrobeats into new sonic territory and cementing himself as a leading figure of his generation; outlets such as *The Native* and writers like Victor Okpala have described him as a trailblazer whose innovations and success have left an indelible mark on Afrobeats and inspired a new wave of African artists.[4][5]
