## Biography
Evan Oberla was born in the Midwest of the United States and developed an early passion for music, gravitating toward instruments like piano and classical guitar in his family's living room while benefiting from a strong school music program and encouraging mentors.[1] Now based in New Orleans, he is a multi-instrumentalist, singer, songwriter, composer, and arranger who has built a diverse career spanning over a decade in jazz, funk, pop, avant-garde, brass bands, and roots music, with trombone as his primary instrument.[1][4][7][8]

Oberla's career includes playing with various bands such as Flow Tribe and leading the group Evan Oberla Project (EOP), formed in 2012 with members including Ero on vocals, Dan Shaw on keys, Jeff Bass on bass, and Nathan Parker on drums.[3][8] His solo work features dream-pop and dynamic sounds blending catchy melodies, as heard in releases like the 2020 single 'Kick It,' which emerged spontaneously during quarantine while setting up livestreams.[1][2] He maintains an active presence in the New Orleans scene, hosting weekly 'Sonic Social Healing Hour' livestreams covering originals and covers from artists like Allen Toussaint to The Strokes.[1]

His musical style defies strict genres, drawing from personal experiences, friends, family, and a wide array of influences to express soulful feelings, much like Miles Davis, emphasizing authenticity and instinct over categorization.[1][7]
