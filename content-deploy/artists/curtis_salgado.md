## Biography
Curtis Salgado, born February 4, 1954, in Everett, Washington, and raised in Eugene, Oregon, is a celebrated American blues, soul blues, and blues rock singer-songwriter and harmonica player. Immersed in music from a young age, Salgado was influenced by his parents' diverse record collection and his siblings' love for soul and blues. A pivotal moment came at age 13, when he attended a Count Basie performance and resolved to pursue music, soon teaching himself harmonica and absorbing the styles of blues legends like Little Walter and Paul Butterfield[2][3].

Salgado's career began in Eugene’s vibrant bar scene, first with The Nighthawks and then as co-leader of The Robert Cray Band, where his dynamic vocals and harmonica work gained regional acclaim. He spent six years with Cray, recording the debut album "Who’s Been Talking" and sharing stages with icons such as Muddy Waters, Bobby Bland, Albert Collins, and Bonnie Raitt[1][3]. After leaving Cray in 1982, Salgado fronted Roomful of Blues from 1984 to 1986, then returned to Oregon to form Curtis Salgado & The Stilettos, touring nationally and opening for acts like Steve Miller and The Doobie Brothers. He also had a brief stint as lead vocalist for Santana in the 1990s and has released numerous acclaimed solo albums, earning 13 Blues Music Awards, including the B.B. King Entertainer of the Year[2][3].

Salgado’s musical style is a rich blend of blues, soul, gospel, R&B, jazz, funk, and rock, marked by passionate vocals and expressive harmonica playing. His legacy extends beyond performance: he inspired John Belushi’s creation of the Blues Brothers characters, with Belushi dedicating the debut Blues Brothers album to Salgado. Today, Salgado is revered as an influential figure in modern blues and soul, known for his powerful live shows and songwriting that bridges traditional and contemporary styles[2][3].
