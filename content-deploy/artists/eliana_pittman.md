## Biography
Eliana Pittman, born Eliana Leite da Silva on August 14, 1945, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, began her musical career as a teenager under the guidance of her stepfather, American jazz saxophonist Booker Pittman, who served as her first music teacher, mentor, and recording partner.[1][3][7] She debuted at the Little Club in Beco das Garrafas in Rio de Janeiro and quickly gained international exposure, appearing on Jack Paar's TV show in New York in 1964.[2] Her debut album, *Eliana & Booker Pittman – News From Brazil* (1963), marked one of the early bossa nova recordings, blending Brazilian rhythms with jazz influences, though her English-language performances showed initial awkwardness.[1][3]

Pittman's breakthrough came with her 1966 hit *Tristeza*, which brought instant recognition across South America, establishing her as one of the soulful Brazilian vocalists of the early 1970s.[1] Renowned for her distinctive swinging voice, scat singing prowess, and ability to transform novelty tunes into jazz-infused treatments, she evolved from bossa nova to styles like soul, funk, and Amazonian carimbó in the 1970s, with albums such as *Tô Chegando, Já Cheguei* (1974).[1][2][3][9] She toured extensively in the 1960s and 1970s across Brazil, Italy, France, Japan, the US, Spain, and Venezuela, and served as the official hostess of the MIDEM festival in Cannes with Sacha Distel from 1968 to 1971.[1][2]

Transitioning into acting, Pittman appeared in Brazilian television and film, including *Tangled Hearts* (2013) and *The Sandpit Generals*.[1][8] In 2001, she launched a comeback tour from Rio de Janeiro, balancing music with occasional TV roles amid periods of seclusion, leaving a legacy as a versatile artist who bridged bossa nova, jazz, and soul.[1]
