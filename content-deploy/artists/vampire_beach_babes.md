## Biography
Vampire Beach Babes are a Canadian rock band formed in Toronto, Ontario in 1997, known for their unique blend of psychobilly, horror punk, gothic rock, and pop rhythms. The band was founded and is fronted by Baron Marcus, with a rotating cast of members over the years, including Bunny (Melinda), Eris, Heather, and Anita Cocktail. Their early work, such as the debut album 'Reckless Summer' (1997), established their reputation in the Toronto goth and alternative music scene, and they quickly became known for their theatrical live performances and darkly playful aesthetic.

Throughout the 2000s, Vampire Beach Babes expanded their sound by incorporating electronic and industrial elements, as heard on albums like 'Attack of the Killer Bikinis' (2002) and 'Beach Blanket Bedlam' (2005). The band gained international attention, performing at major events such as the Whitby Gothic Weekend in the UK, and were featured by Metal Hammer magazine as one of the world's 28 upcoming metal bands to watch in 2006. Their music has been featured in television and film, including episodes of 'The Best Years,' 'Shadow Hunter,' and 'Dragula.'

Vampire Beach Babes have maintained a cult following, with their members often describing the band as a 'destined' project with a sense of timelessness. Their legacy is marked by their genre-blending approach, contributions to the Canadian goth scene, and ongoing creative projects, such as the multimedia 'Angel Devil Machine' initiative that merges music, narrative, and gaming.
