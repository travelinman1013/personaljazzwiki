## Biography
Esther Mae Jones, professionally known as Little Esther and later as Esther Phillips, was born on December 23, 1935, in Galveston, Texas. After her parents divorced, she moved to Los Angeles with her mother and grew up in the Watts neighborhood, where she began singing in church choirs at a young age. Her prodigious talent was discovered at age 13 when her sister entered her in a local talent contest at Johnny Otis's Barrelhouse Club. Otis, a prominent bandleader, was so impressed that he signed her to his traveling revue, the California Rhythm and Blues Caravan, and recorded her for Modern Records. Under the moniker 'Little Esther,' she quickly rose to fame with a series of R&B hits, including "Double Crossing Blues" and "Mistrustin' Blues," becoming one of the youngest stars in the genre during the early 1950s.[1][3][5]

After the Otis group disbanded in 1952, Little Esther pursued a solo career, but struggled with drug addiction, which hampered her success and led to periods of inactivity. She relocated to Houston in 1954 and was largely absent from the music scene until her rediscovery in the early 1960s by Kenny Rogers, who helped secure her a recording contract with Lenox Records. Adopting the stage name Esther Phillips, inspired by a Phillips gasoline station sign, she reinvented herself with a broader repertoire, blending R&B, jazz, blues, country, and soul. Her 1962 rendition of "Release Me" became a major hit, and she continued to record acclaimed albums such as "From a Whisper to a Scream" and "Alone Again Naturally." Despite ongoing struggles with addiction, Phillips remained a respected and influential figure, earning a Grammy nomination in 1973 and performing internationally, including a notable appearance with the Beatles on BBC-TV.[1][3][4]

Esther Phillips's musical style was distinguished by her expressive, textured voice and her ability to interpret songs across genres, from jazz standards to soulful ballads. She was celebrated for her jazz phrasing and emotional depth, often drawing inspiration from artists like Sarah Vaughan and Charlie Parker. Her career, marked by both triumphs and personal challenges, left a lasting legacy in American music, influencing generations of vocalists and earning her recognition as "the indisputable queen of the blues." Phillips died of kidney and liver failure in Carson, California, on August 7, 1984, but her recordings continue to inspire and resonate with audiences.[1][2][5]
