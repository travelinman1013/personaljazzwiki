## Biography
Valerie June (born Valerie June Hockett in 1982) is an acclaimed American singer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist from Jackson, Tennessee. Raised in a small town and later honing her craft in Memphis, June’s music is a vibrant blend of folk, blues, gospel, soul, country, Appalachian, and bluegrass traditions. A self-taught musician, she began performing in the early 2000s, initially as part of the duo Bella Sun with her then-husband, before embarking on a solo career. Her unique voice and eclectic style quickly set her apart, drawing from a wide spectrum of influences and the rich musical heritage of the American South. June’s journey included years of working various jobs to support her music, busking, and self-releasing lo-fi recordings before gaining wider recognition through festival performances and collaborations.

Sunny War (born Sydney Lyndella Ward) is a Nashville-born singer-songwriter and guitarist whose music fuses punk, early blues, folk, and grunge. Known for her virtuosic fingerpicking and raw, emotionally honest songwriting, Sunny War’s life has been marked by periods of homelessness and train-hopping, experiences that deeply inform her art. Her sound is characterized by a blend of protest, resilience, and radical empathy, and she has become a prominent voice in contemporary Americana and roots music. Sunny War’s career includes critically acclaimed albums such as 'Anarchist Gospel' and 'Armageddon in a Summer Dress,' and she is recognized for her commitment to themes of mutual aid and community. She has opened for artists like Mavis Staples, Booker T, and Valerie June, and is celebrated for her ability to challenge musical norms while remaining deeply personal and authentic.
