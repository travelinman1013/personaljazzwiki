## Biography
Everything But the Girl (EBTG) is an English musical duo formed in 1982 in Kingston upon Hull by Tracey Thorn and Ben Watt, who met as students at the University of Hull in 1981. Both were already signed to Cherry Red Records: Thorn as part of the lo-fi minimal girl group Marine Girls, and Watt as a solo guitarist and singer-songwriter. Their debut album *Eden* (1984) blended folk-jazz and sophisti-pop, reaching No. 14 on the UK Albums Chart, followed by stylistic shifts through politicized guitar-pop on *Love Not Money* (1985), ambitious orchestral sounds on *Baby, the Stars Shine Bright* (1986), and later electronic transformations.[1][2][4]

The duo achieved global success with the 1994 Todd Terry remix of 'Missing' from *Amplified Heart*, marking a pivot to downtempo electronic music. Albums like *Walking Wounded* (1996) and *Temperamental* (1999) topped UK charts, showcasing their evolution from jazz-influenced pop to house and electronica. In 2000, after the birth of their twins in 1998, they paused activity; Thorn focused on family and solo work from 2007, while Watt pursued DJing, production, and his Buzzin’ Fly label until 2014.[1][2][3]

EBTG reunited in later years, with Watt's label acquiring their early catalogue in 2017. Thorn and Watt married in 2009 after keeping their relationship private during the band's active years. Their legacy spans indie beginnings to electronic reinvention, influencing sophisti-pop and downtempo genres.[1][2]

## Fun Facts
- The band's name comes from a slogan by Turner's Furniture store in Hull: 'Everything but the girl,' referring to excluding a girlfriend from a furniture purchase.[2][3]
- Ben Watt was hospitalized for 10 weeks in 1992 with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, a rare autoimmune disease, leading to the cancellation of tours; he later wrote the memoir *Patient* about the experience.[1][2]
- Tracey Thorn's lyric in debut single 'Each and Every One' was a response to patronizing reviews of her Marine Girls work by male critics, not a lovelorn lament as often misinterpreted.[2]
- Paul Weller surprised audiences by joining them onstage at London's ICA in 1983, shortly after splitting The Jam.[1]
