## Biography
Toronzo Cannon, born February 14, 1968, in Chicago, Illinois, grew up on the city's South Side near the Robert Taylor Homes and the legendary Theresa's Lounge, where he would sneak peeks at performances by blues icons like Buddy Guy and Junior Wells. Raised by his teenage mother, grandparents, and exposed to blues, R&B, and soul at family gatherings, Cannon received his first guitar at age 22 from his sister. Initially drawn to reggae and influenced by Bob Marley, he quickly mastered the instrument and shifted to blues after discovering Jimi Hendrix, unlocking a latent passion that became his true voice[1][2][3][4].

Cannon paid his dues on the Chicago blues circuit as a sideman guitarist from 1996 to 2002, backing artists like Tommy McCracken, Wayne Baker Brooks, L.V. Banks, and Joanna Connor. In 2001, he formed his own band, The Cannonball Express, transitioning to full-time bandleader by 2003. His discography includes self-released My Woman (2007), Delmark albums Leaving Mood (2011) and Blues Music Award-nominated John The Conqueror Root (2013), followed by breakthroughs on Alligator Records: The Chicago Way (2016), hailed as a top blues album, and The Preacher, The Politician Or The Pimp (2019), which garnered 10 Blues Music Award nominations and international acclaim[1][2][4][5][7]. His style fuses muscular, rock-inspired electric blues guitar with soulful vocals and vivid, slice-of-life songwriting rooted in Chicago traditions[5][6][8].

Beyond music, Cannon drives a Chicago Transit Authority bus, a 29-year job that informs his authentic lyrics about everyday life, earning praise from peers like Gary Clark Jr. and Joe Bonamassa. A ten-time Chicago Blues Festival performer, he has elevated from local hero to global torchbearer of contemporary Chicago blues[5][7][8].
