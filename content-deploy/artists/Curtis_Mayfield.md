## Biography
Curtis Lee Mayfield (June 3, 1942 – December 26, 1999) was a pioneering American singer-songwriter, guitarist, and producer, renowned for his profound influence on soul, funk, and socially conscious African-American music. Born in Chicago, Illinois, Mayfield's early exposure to gospel and blues shaped his musical foundation. He began singing in a gospel choir and formed his first group, the Alphatones, before joining Jerry Butler in the Roosters, who later became the Impressions. As the group's lead singer and songwriter, Mayfield brought a unique blend of smooth falsetto vocals and socially aware lyrics, penning classics like 'People Get Ready' and 'Gypsy Woman.'[1][4][7]

In the 1960s, Mayfield and the Impressions became voices of the civil rights movement, with songs that addressed themes of hope, empowerment, and social justice. After leaving the Impressions in 1970, Mayfield launched a successful solo career, founding Curtom Records and releasing influential albums such as 'Curtis' and the iconic 'Superfly' soundtrack. His innovative fusion of funk, gospel, and soul, coupled with his fearless commentary on social issues, cemented his legacy as a 'Gentle Genius' and a trailblazer in American music.[1][6][7]

Despite personal hardships, including a paralyzing accident in 1990, Mayfield continued to create and inspire until his death in 1999. His work not only shaped the sound of soul and funk but also paved the way for generations of artists to address political and social realities through music.[1][7]
