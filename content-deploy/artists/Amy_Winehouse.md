## Biography
Amy Jade Winehouse (born September 14, 1983, in London, England) was an English singer-songwriter celebrated for her deeply expressive contralto vocals and her unique fusion of soul, jazz, and rhythm and blues. Raised in a musical family, Winehouse was exposed to jazz standards and classic soul from an early age, which shaped her musical sensibilities. She attended the Sylvia Young Theatre School and later the BRIT School, developing her talents before joining the National Youth Jazz Orchestra as a teenager. Her breakthrough came in 2003 with her debut album 'Frank,' a critically acclaimed collection rooted in jazz and soul, earning her multiple award nominations and the Ivor Novello Award for 'Stronger Than Me.'[2][4][8]

Winehouse's second album, 'Back to Black' (2006), propelled her to international stardom. The album, marked by its raw lyricism and retro-soul production, became one of the best-selling albums in UK history and won her five Grammy Awards in a single night, including Best New Artist, Record of the Year, and Song of the Year for 'Rehab.' Her music was lauded for its honesty and emotional depth, often reflecting her personal struggles with addiction and tumultuous relationships. Despite her immense talent and success, Winehouse's career was marred by substance abuse and health issues, leading to her untimely death from alcohol poisoning on July 23, 2011, at the age of 27. Her legacy endures as a cultural icon whose work continues to influence artists across genres.[2][4][7]
