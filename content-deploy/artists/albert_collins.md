## Biography
Albert Collins, born Albert Gene Drewery on October 1, 1932, in Leona, Texas, was a pioneering American electric blues guitarist and singer celebrated for his powerful, percussive playing and distinctive sound. Raised in a musical family, Collins was introduced to the guitar by his cousin, the influential bluesman Lightnin’ Hopkins, and further guided by cousin Willow Young, who taught him the altered tunings that became his signature. After moving to Houston in 1941, Collins began his musical journey in earnest, forming his first band, the Rhythm Rockers, at age eighteen and recording his debut single, 'The Freeze,' in 1958.

Collins’s guitar style was marked by his use of open minor tunings, a capo, and finger-plucking technique, all of which contributed to his sharp, 'ice-pick' tone and earned him the nicknames 'The Iceman' and 'Master of the Telecaster.' His energetic performances, which often saw him walking through crowds with a long guitar cord, became legendary. Collins’s career gained national attention in the 1960s and 1970s, particularly after moving to California and collaborating with artists like Canned Heat. He signed with Alligator Records in the late 1970s, releasing acclaimed albums such as 'Ice Pickin’' and winning a Grammy for 'Showdown!' with Robert Cray and Johnny Copeland. Collins’s influence extended well beyond his own recordings, shaping the sound of modern blues and inspiring generations of guitarists. He passed away on November 24, 1993, in Las Vegas, Nevada, leaving a lasting legacy as one of the most innovative and influential blues musicians of his era.
