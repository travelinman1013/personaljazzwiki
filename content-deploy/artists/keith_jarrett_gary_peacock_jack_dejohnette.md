## Biography
Keith Jarrett (born 1945, Allentown, Pennsylvania), Gary Peacock (1935–2020, Burley, Idaho), and Jack DeJohnette (1942–2025, Chicago, Illinois) formed one of the most influential and enduring jazz trios of the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Jarrett, a prodigious pianist, began his career with Art Blakey’s Jazz Messengers and rose to prominence through collaborations with Charles Lloyd and Miles Davis, as well as his groundbreaking solo piano recordings. Peacock, a bassist known for his melodic inventiveness, played with avant-garde and mainstream jazz figures, including Albert Ayler and Bill Evans, and spent formative years in Japan exploring Eastern philosophy and music. DeJohnette, a versatile drummer, established his reputation with Charles Lloyd and Miles Davis before becoming a leader in his own right.

The trio first played together on Peacock’s 1977 album 'Tales of Another,' but it was in 1983 that they officially formed the 'Standards Trio' to record 'Standards, Vol. 1.' Their collaboration was marked by a democratic approach to improvisation, with each member contributing equally to the group’s sound. Over more than three decades, they released over 20 albums, mostly live recordings, and became renowned for their telepathic interplay and ability to reinterpret the Great American Songbook with both reverence and innovation. Their work revitalized the jazz piano trio format and set a new standard for group improvisation.

The trio’s legacy is profound: they redefined the possibilities of jazz standards, inspiring generations of musicians with their balance of tradition and exploration. Their performances were celebrated for their emotional depth, technical mastery, and the sense of risk and discovery that permeated every concert. The trio’s influence extends far beyond jazz, shaping the broader landscape of improvised music.
