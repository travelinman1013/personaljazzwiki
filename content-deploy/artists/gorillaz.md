## Biography
Gorillaz is an English virtual band created in 1998 by musician Damon Albarn, best known as the frontman of Blur, and comic-book artist Jamie Hewlett, co-creator of the cult series Tank Girl.[4][1] The seeds of the project were planted in 1990, when Blur guitarist Graham Coxon, a fan of Hewlett’s work in Deadline magazine, invited him to interview the newly formed band; although Albarn and Hewlett initially clashed, they later became flatmates in London in 1997, where the idea for a “manufactured” cartoon group emerged while they watched MTV and criticized the superficiality of contemporary pop and boy bands.[4][3] Conceived as both a satire of pop culture and a genuine musical project, Gorillaz debuted as a four-piece fictional lineup—2-D (vocals, keyboards), Murdoc Niccals (bass), Noodle (guitar, vocals, keyboards), and Russel Hobbs (drums)—whose adventures unfold across music videos, web content, and animated shorts, while Albarn and a shifting cast of collaborators handle the real-world recordings.[4][1]

From 1998 to 2000, Albarn recorded the band’s self-titled debut album largely at his Studio 13 in London and at Geejam Studios in Jamaica, refining a sound that blended Britpop songwriting with hip hop, dub, electronic, and world-music influences.[4][1] The EP "Tomorrow Comes Today" (2000) introduced the project, and the full-length album "Gorillaz" (2001) became a global success, selling over seven million copies and earning a Mercury Prize nomination, which the band later withdrew.[1][4] Their second album, "Demon Days" (2005), propelled them to even greater prominence, going six-times platinum in the UK and double platinum in the US on the strength of singles like "Feel Good Inc.", "DARE", and "Dirty Harry".[4] Subsequent releases such as "Plastic Beach" (2010), with its synth-pop textures, environmental themes, and high-profile guests including Bobby Womack, Lou Reed, and Little Dragon, reinforced Gorillaz as a collaborative hub and multimedia universe as much as a band.[4]

Musically, Gorillaz is characterized by an eclectic, deliberately postmodern approach that fuses trip-hop, punk, electronica, hip hop, and art pop, while visually drawing from Hewlett’s comic and animation aesthetics.[2][1] The project has expanded notions of what a “band” can be, pioneering a model in which virtual avatars front a rotating real-world ensemble and performances incorporate animation, holographic elements, and elaborate stage design.[2][4] Often cited as one of the most successful virtual bands in history, Gorillaz has influenced later multimedia music projects and virtual or animated acts, and its universe—spanning albums, videos, web series, and lore—continues to evolve, cementing the group’s legacy as a boundary-pushing fusion of music, visual art, and storytelling.[3][9]

## Fun Facts
- Gorillaz originally called themselves "Gorilla" and their first recorded song, "Ghost Train", later surfaced as a B-side to the single "Rock the House".[4]
- Damon Albarn and Jamie Hewlett reportedly conceived the idea for Gorillaz while watching MTV and reacting against what they saw as the shallow, manufactured nature of then-dominant boy bands.[4][3]
- Although Gorillaz were nominated for the prestigious Mercury Prize for their debut album, the nomination was withdrawn at the band’s own request.[1]
- The fictional band members each have detailed backstories, and their universe extends across music videos, interviews, and animated shorts, making Gorillaz as much a narrative project as a musical one.[1][6]
