## Biography
The Joe Krown Trio is a celebrated New Orleans-based group led by acclaimed pianist and organist Joe Krown, renowned for his mastery of the New Orleans piano tradition. Krown, originally from the Northeast, moved to New Orleans in 1992, immersing himself in the city’s vibrant music scene and quickly establishing himself as a first-call keyboardist. Over the years, he has become a fixture at iconic venues and festivals, including regular performances at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival and the French Quarter Festival.

The Trio has featured a rotating cast of top-tier New Orleans musicians. Early incarnations included Brint Anderson (vocals, guitar) and Mike Barras (drums), while later and most recognized lineups featured Walter "Wolfman" Washington (guitar, vocals) and Russell Batiste, Jr. (drums), with Wayne Maureau later replacing Batiste. The group is known for its dynamic blend of blues, funk, and traditional New Orleans R&B, with Krown’s Hammond B-3 organ work at the center, often covering both melodic and bass lines. Their albums, such as "Live at the Maple Leaf" (2008), "Triple Threat" (2010), and "Soul Understanding" (2013), have been praised for capturing the energy and spirit of New Orleans music.

The Joe Krown Trio’s legacy lies in its authentic representation of the city’s musical heritage, blending the influences of legends like Professor Longhair, Allen Toussaint, and Dr. John with Krown’s own virtuosic style. Through club residencies, festival appearances, and international tours, the Trio has contributed to keeping the New Orleans sound alive and evolving, inspiring both peers and new generations of musicians.
