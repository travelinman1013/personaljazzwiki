## Biography
Bill Bruford, born on May 17, 1949, in Kent County near London, England, grew up immersed in jazz as an amateur drummer in the 1960s. After a handful of lessons from Lou Pocock of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and informal instruction from a schoolmate using Jim Chapin's tutor book, he turned professional in 1968, joining Yes and becoming a key figure in British progressive rock. His early career included stints with King Crimson (1972-1974), where Jamie Muir's influence shaped his polyrhythmic style, and guest appearances with Genesis on their 1976 tour.[1][2][8]

Bruford's career evolved through the late 1970s and 1980s, releasing his solo debut Feels Good To Me (1978), co-founding U.K. with John Wetton (1977-1978), and rejoining King Crimson for their Discipline-era lineup (1981-1984), pioneering electronic percussion. In 1986, he formed the electro-acoustic jazz group Earthworks with Django Bates and Iain Ballamy, emphasizing melodic drumming in a jazz context, producing acclaimed albums like Earthworks (1987) and Dig? (1989). He participated in King Crimson's double-trio formation (1994-1996) alongside Pat Mastelotto.[1][2][3]

Retiring from stage performance in 2009 after over 40 years, Bruford published an autobiography, earned a PhD in music from Surrey University, and later returned to playing with the Pete Roth Trio around age 75. Known for boundary-crossing from progressive rock to jazz fusion, his legacy includes induction into the Modern Drummer Hall of Fame in 1990 and innovative drumming across genres.[2][3][4]
