## Biography
Linkin Park is an American rock band formed in 1996 in Los Angeles, California, by high school friends Mike Shinoda, Brad Delson, and Rob Bourdon. Initially performing under the name Xero, the band struggled to find commercial success and underwent several lineup changes, including the addition of DJ Joe Hahn and bassist Dave 'Phoenix' Farrell. Their breakthrough came in 1999 with the arrival of vocalist Chester Bennington, whose dynamic range and emotive delivery became central to the band's identity. The group soon rebranded as Linkin Park and released their debut album, Hybrid Theory, in 2000. The album, blending nu metal, rap, and electronic elements, became a massive commercial success, earning Diamond certification and producing hits like 'In the End' and 'Crawling.'

Over the next two decades, Linkin Park continued to innovate, releasing a string of successful albums such as Meteora, Minutes to Midnight, and A Thousand Suns, each exploring new sonic territories from alternative metal to electronica and pop. Their willingness to experiment and collaborate, including the Jay-Z mashup album Collision Course, kept them at the forefront of modern rock. The band’s lyrics often addressed themes of personal struggle, alienation, and resilience, resonating with a global audience.

Linkin Park's legacy is marked by their genre-defying sound and cultural impact, influencing a generation of artists across rock, metal, and hip-hop. The tragic death of Chester Bennington in 2017 led to a hiatus, but the band’s influence endures through their extensive discography, innovative approach, and the emotional connection they forged with fans worldwide.
