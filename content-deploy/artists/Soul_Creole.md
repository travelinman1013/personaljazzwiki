- **Origin**: Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago

## Biography
Soul Creole is not a standalone artist but rather the name of a project led by Trinidad-born trumpeter, composer, and bandleader Etienne Charles. Born in July 1983 in Port of Spain, Trinidad, Charles was raised in a musically rich environment—his great-grandfather played banjo and violin, and his family’s French Caribbean, Spanish, African, and Venezuelan heritage deeply influenced his musical outlook. After early musical training in Trinidad, Charles moved to the United States, attending Florida State University and later Juilliard in New York, where he honed his craft under the mentorship of jazz pianist Marcus Roberts.

Charles launched his professional career with the album 'Culture Shock,' but it was his project 'Creole Soul' that brought him international acclaim. The Creole Soul ensemble explores the intersections of Afro-Caribbean, Creole, New Orleans, and American jazz traditions, blending calypso, reggae, Haitian vodou, Motown, and R&B influences. Charles’s work is characterized by lush trumpet lines, complex rhythms, and a commitment to storytelling that highlights marginalized communities and the African diaspora’s cultural migrations. His music is both a celebration of his heritage and a vehicle for social commentary, earning him numerous awards and recognition, including a Guggenheim Fellowship and the French Chevalier de l’Ordre des Arts et des Lettres.
