## Biography
Jane Monheit, born November 3, 1977, in Oakdale, Long Island, New York, grew up in a musically rich family environment. Her mother performed in musical theater, her father played banjo and guitar, and both her aunt and grandmother were professional singers, immersing Jane in a diverse range of musical influences from an early age. She attended the Usdan Summer Camp for the Arts and later studied voice at the Manhattan School of Music under Peter Eldridge, graduating with honors in 1999. At just 20, Monheit was the first runner-up in the 1998 Thelonious Monk Institute Vocal Competition, a pivotal moment that launched her professional career.

Monheit’s debut album, 'Never Never Land,' released in 2000, featured jazz luminaries such as Kenny Barron and Ron Carter, and was lauded by critics, remaining on the Billboard Jazz chart for over a year. Her subsequent albums, including 'Come Dream with Me' and 'In the Sun,' further established her as a leading voice in contemporary vocal jazz, celebrated for her warm, supple tone and interpretive depth. Monheit’s repertoire draws heavily from the Great American Songbook, and her style is characterized by a blend of technical virtuosity, emotional honesty, and a storytelling sensibility shaped by her family’s musical traditions.

Over the years, Monheit has become recognized as one of the foremost jazz vocalists of her generation, noted for her tributes to Ella Fitzgerald and her ability to breathe new life into classic standards. Her performances and recordings have earned her critical acclaim and a devoted following, cementing her legacy as a vital interpreter of jazz and popular song.
