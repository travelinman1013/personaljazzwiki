## Biography
Clara Smith (March 13, 1894 – February 2, 1935) was a pioneering American blues singer, celebrated as the 'Queen of the Moaners' for her emotive vocal style. Born in Spartanburg, South Carolina, Smith grew up in a working-class family and, despite never attending formal school, was literate and drawn to music from an early age. She began her career performing in traveling tent shows and on the African-American theater circuit, quickly gaining a reputation for her sweet yet powerful voice.

By the late 1910s, Smith was a headliner across the Southern states, and in 1923 she moved to New York City, immersing herself in Harlem's vibrant cabaret and theater scene. That same year, she signed with Columbia Records, launching a prolific recording career that saw her cut over 120 sides, including collaborations with jazz greats like Louis Armstrong, Fletcher Henderson, and Don Redman. Smith's repertoire evolved from mournful ballads to more upbeat and even risqué numbers, reflecting both her versatility and the changing tastes of the era. Her duets with Bessie Smith (no relation), such as 'My Man Blues' and 'Far Away Blues,' are considered classics of the genre.

Smith's influence extended beyond her recordings; she was a mentor to future superstar Josephine Baker and helped shape the classic female blues tradition. Though overshadowed in later years by contemporaries like Bessie Smith, Clara Smith was a major star in her time, performing coast to coast and leaving a legacy as one of the most significant voices of 1920s blues.
