## Biography
Sonny Rollins, born Walter Theodore Rollins on September 7, 1930, in New York City, is widely regarded as one of the most influential jazz tenor saxophonists in history. Raised in Harlem by parents from the Virgin Islands, Rollins was immersed in a vibrant musical environment from an early age, receiving his first saxophone as a child and playing alongside future jazz greats like Jackie McLean and Art Taylor during his teenage years[1][5]. Inspired initially by Louis Jordan and later by his idol Coleman Hawkins, Rollins switched to tenor saxophone in 1946, setting the stage for his future innovations in jazz[1][3].

Rollins began his professional career in the late 1940s, recording with bebop luminaries such as Babs Gonzales, Bud Powell, and Thelonious Monk[1][2][5]. His early years were marked by personal struggles, including a battle with heroin addiction, but after overcoming these challenges, he emerged as a leading figure in the hard bop movement. Rollins's compositions like "St. Thomas," "Oleo," "Doxy," and "Airegin" became jazz standards, and his improvisational prowess earned him the reputation as "the greatest living improviser"[1][3]. Throughout his career, Rollins collaborated with legends such as Miles Davis, Clifford Brown, and Max Roach, constantly evolving his style to embrace elements of cool jazz, free jazz, and even funk and R&B[2][3].

Rollins's legacy is defined by his technical mastery, inventive improvisation, and willingness to push the boundaries of jazz. He was among the first to experiment with unaccompanied saxophone solos and manipulation of tone color, influencing generations of avant-garde musicians[3]. Over a career spanning seven decades and more than sixty albums as a leader, Rollins received numerous accolades, including multiple Grammy Awards, the National Medal of Arts, and Kennedy Center Honors[3]. He retired from public performance in 2014 due to health issues, leaving behind a profound impact on the world of jazz[1].
