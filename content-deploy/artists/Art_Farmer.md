## Biography
Art Farmer (August 21, 1928 – October 4, 1999) was a highly influential American jazz trumpeter and flugelhorn player, renowned for his lyrical style and warm tone. Born in Council Bluffs, Iowa, and raised in Phoenix, Arizona, Farmer began playing piano in elementary school before switching to trumpet at age 13. He moved to Los Angeles in 1945 with his twin brother Addison, a bassist, where both attended a music-oriented high school and quickly became active in the local jazz scene. Farmer's early professional years saw him collaborating with prominent West Coast musicians, and his 1952 recording of 'Farmer's Market' brought him significant attention.

In the 1950s, Farmer moved to New York, performing and recording with leading figures such as Horace Silver, Sonny Rollins, and Gigi Gryce, establishing himself as a key player in the bebop and hard bop movements. He was a founding member of the Jazztet with Benny Golson in 1959, a group celebrated for its sophisticated arrangements and influential recordings. Farmer's quest for a distinctive sound led him to switch from trumpet to flugelhorn in the early 1960s, helping to popularize the instrument as a jazz soloist's tool. In 1968, he relocated to Vienna, Austria, where he continued to perform, record, and mentor younger musicians while maintaining strong ties to the American jazz scene.

Farmer's legacy is marked by over 50 albums as a leader, a dozen with the Jazztet, and countless collaborations. His improvisational approach emphasized melodic clarity, emotional depth, and elegant phrasing over technical display. Farmer's pioneering use of the flugelhorn and later the flumpet, a custom hybrid instrument, cemented his reputation as one of jazz's most original and expressive voices.
