## Biography
Irma Thomas, born Irma Lee on February 18, 1941, in Ponchatoula, Louisiana, and raised in New Orleans, is celebrated as the 'Soul Queen of New Orleans.' Her early life was marked by both hardship and resilience—she became a mother at 14 and was supporting four children by the age of 19. Despite these challenges, Thomas’s musical journey began in her teens, singing in Baptist church choirs and later performing in local clubs while working as a waitress. Her big break came when bandleader Tommy Ridgley recognized her talent and helped her secure her first recording contract with Ron Records, leading to the release of her debut single, 'Don't Mess with My Man,' in 1959, which became a regional hit.

Throughout the 1960s, Thomas recorded for Minit and Imperial Records, collaborating with legendary songwriter and producer Allen Toussaint on classics like 'It's Raining' and 'Ruler of My Heart.' Though she never achieved the mainstream commercial success of contemporaries like Aretha Franklin or Etta James, her emotive, gospel-infused vocal style and ability to inhabit a song’s lyrics earned her a devoted following and critical acclaim. After a period away from music in the 1970s, Thomas revived her career, eventually winning a Grammy Award in 2007 for Best Contemporary Blues Album with 'After the Rain.'

Irma Thomas’s legacy is defined by her expressive voice, her role in shaping the New Orleans R&B and soul sound, and her enduring influence over more than five decades. She remains an active performer, a beloved figure in her hometown, and a symbol of perseverance and artistry in American music.
