## Biography
Eddie Condon, born Albert Edwin Condon on November 16, 1905, in Goodland, Indiana, grew up as the youngest of nine children in a musical household where his sisters took piano lessons, fostering his early passion for music. By high school, he was deeply immersed in jazz, leaving at age 16 to tour with Hollis Peavey's Jazz Bandits for two years. In Chicago during the 1920s, he became a key figure in the Chicago jazz scene, playing with notables like Bix Beiderbecke, Jack Teagarden, and Frank Teschemacher, and co-forming the Chicago Rhythm Kings with Red McKenzie in 1925. He and fellow white musicians learned from Black innovators like King Oliver at Lincoln Gardens and Louis Armstrong at the Sunset Café.[1][3]

In 1928, Condon moved to New York City, where 'Eddie's Hot Shots'—his interracial band—recorded two Victor sides on February 8, 1929, featuring Mezz Mezzrow, Jack Teagarden, Leonard Davis, Happy Caldwell, and George Stafford, marking a pioneering effort in breaking the color line in recording studios. This led to further integrated sessions with Fats Waller and Louis Armstrong. Condon's style championed Chicago jazz rhythms on banjo and guitar, and he continued arranging sessions, recording extensively from 1938 with Commodore Records, and leading bands at Nick's nightclub from 1937. His innovations included Town Hall Jazz Concerts starting in 1944 and opening his own Greenwich Village club in 1945.[1][2][3]

Condon authored 'We Called It Music,' solidifying his legacy as a bandleader, promoter, and integrator of jazz. He remained active until his death on August 4, 1973, influencing jazz through racially mixed ensembles and live broadcasts, including the first TV jazz band appearance.[2][3]
