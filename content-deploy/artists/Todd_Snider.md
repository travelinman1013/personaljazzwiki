## Biography
Todd Snider is a renowned American singer-songwriter celebrated for his witty, incisive storytelling and his distinctive blend of alt-country, Americana, and folk. Born in Portland, Oregon, on October 11, 1966, Snider spent his formative years in various parts of the country before settling in San Marcos, Texas, where he began honing his craft in the vibrant local music scene during the 1980s. After moving to Memphis in the mid-1980s, he established himself at the Daily Planet club, where he was discovered by Keith Sykes, a member of Jimmy Buffett's Coral Reefer Band. This pivotal connection led to Snider being signed by Buffett's label and later releasing his debut album, 'Songs for the Daily Planet,' in 1994, which featured the satirical hit 'Talkin' Seattle Grunge Rock Blues.'[9][2]

Over the following decades, Snider built a reputation as a modern troubadour, drawing comparisons to songwriting legends like John Prine, Jerry Jeff Walker, and Guy Clark. His albums, including 'East Nashville Skyline,' 'Peace Queer,' and 'Agnostic Hymns and Stoner Fables,' showcase his ability to blend humor, political commentary, and personal reflection. Snider's music is marked by its conversational lyricism, sardonic wit, and a deep empathy for the marginalized and misunderstood. Beyond his solo work, he has collaborated with a wide range of musicians and launched his own label, Aimless Records, in 2008. Snider is widely regarded as a torchbearer for the live-it-to-learn-it songwriting tradition, influencing a new generation of Americana artists.[2][1][9]
