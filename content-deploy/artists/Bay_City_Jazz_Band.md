## Biography
The Bay City Jazz Band is a traditional jazz ensemble formed in San Francisco, California, in March 1955 by trombonist Sanford Newbauer and cornetist Everett Farey. Drawing inspiration from the Yerba Buena Jazz Band and the revivalist movement led by Lu Watters and Turk Murphy, the group quickly established itself as a leading exponent of the West Coast traditional jazz scene. Their early performances, notably at venues such as the Sail ‘N bar and dance hall near The Embarcadero, helped revive the two-beat jazz style that characterized the San Francisco jazz renaissance of the mid-20th century.[1][2]

Throughout the late 1950s, the Bay City Jazz Band became known as the most popular successor to the Watters tradition, inheriting not only the style and repertoire of their predecessors but also their fan base and, on occasion, former members like Bob Helm and Wally Rose. The band’s sound was marked by a prominent tuba and banjo rhythm section, occasional use of a second cornet, and a dedication to authentic arrangements from the classic jazz era. Over the years, the group saw several personnel changes and reconvened in various forms, including as the New Bay City Jazz Band in the 1970s and 1980s, continuing to perform at jazz festivals and clubs.[2][4]

The Bay City Jazz Band’s legacy lies in its faithful preservation and energetic performance of traditional jazz, bridging the gap between the original revivalists and later generations of musicians. Their recordings for the Good Time Jazz label in the 1950s remain influential documents of the West Coast revivalist style, and their collaborative spirit fostered a vibrant community of jazz musicians in the Bay Area.[8]
