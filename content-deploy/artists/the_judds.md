## Biography
The Judds were an American country music duo composed of mother Naomi Judd (born Diana Ellen Judd on January 11, 1946, in Ashland, Kentucky) and her daughter Wynonna Judd (born Christina Claire Ciminella on May 30, 1964, also in Ashland, Kentucky).[1][4] Growing up in poverty in Kentucky, the two eventually moved to Nashville in the late 1970s, where Naomi worked as a nurse while pursuing a musical career with her daughter. Their breakthrough came in 1982 when record producer Brent Maher heard their audition tape and was impressed by Wynonna's powerful lead vocals complemented by Naomi's delicate harmonizing.[1][4] Signed to RCA Records in 1983, The Judds quickly became one of the most successful acts in country music history, releasing their first single "Had a Dream (For the Heart)" in November 1983, followed by their first number-one hit "Mama He's Crazy" in 1984.[3][4]

Between 1983 and 1991, The Judds dominated country music with their distinctive blend of traditional country sounds and popular music styles, characterized by pure, unadorned harmonies and acoustic guitar-driven arrangements.[1][6] They charted more than twenty singles on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts, with fourteen reaching number one, and won five Grammy Awards for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, along with nine Country Music Association awards.[1][2] Their albums, including the platinum-selling *Why Not Me* (1984), established them as spokeswomen for a new generation of female country music fans.[1] The duo disbanded in 1991 after Naomi was diagnosed with hepatitis C and could no longer tour, though they reunited on multiple occasions throughout the following decades.[1][2]

Following their disbanding, Wynonna launched a highly successful solo career, charting over 25 singles and achieving four number-one hits on the Hot Country Songs charts.[1] The Judds reunited briefly in 1999 and again for a full-fledged reunion tour in 2010-11, which was documented on a cable television series.[4] Their final performance together took place at the CMT Music Awards in April 2022.[1] Tragically, Naomi Judd died by suicide on April 30, 2022, one day before she and Wynonna were inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame.[1][2][4]

## Fun Facts
- Naomi Judd was born Diana Ellen Judd and worked as a nurse at Williamson County Medical Center before pursuing music full-time; her breakthrough with The Judds came through a chance encounter with producer Brent Maher, whose teenage daughter was a schoolmate of Wynonna's and had been injured in a car accident.[3][4]
- The Judds' first album *Why Not Me* (1984) sold a million copies in the United States and was described by AllMusic critic Steve Huey as taking its place as a classic of modern country music.[1]
- Between 1984 and 1989, The Judds achieved 15 number-one singles, making them one of the most popular and successful country acts of the 1980s and establishing them as the top-selling country music duo in recording history.[5][6]
- Wynonna Judd's birth name was Christina Ciminella; she was born when Naomi was only 17 years old, and the mother-daughter duo later became music royalty to their fans despite only performing regularly for eight years before their initial disbanding in 1991.[1][2][5]
