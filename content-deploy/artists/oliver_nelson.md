## Biography
Oliver Edward Nelson (June 4, 1932 – October 28, 1975) was an American jazz saxophonist, clarinetist, arranger, composer, and bandleader born in St. Louis, Missouri, into a musical family with a saxophonist brother and a sister who sang and played piano. He began piano at age six, saxophone at 11, and played in territory bands from 1947 before joining Louis Jordan's band (1950-1951), where he arranged charts and discovered modern music beyond classical influences. After studying composition at Washington University and Lincoln University (master's in 1958) with teachers like Elliott Carter, he moved to New York, worked as Apollo Theater arranger, and recorded leaders for Prestige from 1959.[1]

His 1961 Impulse! album *The Blues and the Abstract Truth* featuring Eric Dolphy, Bill Evans, Freddie Hubbard, and Roy Haynes marked his breakthrough as a composer-arranger. He arranged for giants like Thelonious Monk, Cannonball Adderley, Sonny Rollins, and Wes Montgomery, played with Count Basie, Duke Ellington, and Quincy Jones (1960-1961), and led big bands on albums like *Afro-American Sketches* and *Full Nelson*. Shifting to soprano sax, he composed for TV (*Ironside*, *Columbo*) and films (*Death of a Gunfighter*) after moving to Los Angeles in 1967, while arranging for pop acts like Nancy Wilson and James Brown.[1]

Nelson led all-star big bands in global performances (1966-1975) and toured West Africa in 1969 with John Klemmer and Ernie Watts for the U.S. State Department. His versatile legacy spans jazz innovation, big band leadership, and prolific media scoring until his death in Los Angeles at age 43.[1]
