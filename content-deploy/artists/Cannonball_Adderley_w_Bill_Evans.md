## Biography
Cannonball Adderley (Julian Edwin Adderley) and Bill Evans are two of jazz's most celebrated figures, each known for their distinctive voices on the alto saxophone and piano, respectively. Their most notable collaborations outside of the Miles Davis Sextet occurred in the late 1950s and early 1960s, resulting in three key albums: 'Portrait of Cannonball' (1958), 'Jump for Joy' (1958), and 'Know What I Mean?' (1961, released 1962). These sessions showcased a unique blend of Adderley's soulful, blues-inflected hard bop and Evans's introspective, harmonically rich pianism, supported by top-tier rhythm sections including Blue Mitchell, Sam Jones, Philly Joe Jones, Percy Heath, and Connie Kay.[1][2][3][5][6]

Both artists came to prominence through their work with Miles Davis, most famously on the landmark album 'Kind of Blue' (1959), which remains a touchstone in jazz history. Their joint projects as co-leaders allowed them to explore a more intimate and conversational interplay, with Evans often serving as arranger and providing a more nuanced, chamber-like atmosphere compared to Adderley's more extroverted solo work. 'Know What I Mean?' in particular is celebrated for its lyrical approach and for featuring early versions of Evans's 'Waltz for Debby' and Davis's 'Nardis,' the latter of which became a signature piece for Evans.[2][3][4][6]

The Adderley/Evans collaborations are regarded as essential entries in both musicians' discographies, illustrating the cross-pollination of hard bop, cool jazz, and modal jazz. Their work together influenced generations of jazz musicians and remains a testament to the creative possibilities of collaboration between two masters from different stylistic backgrounds.[1][2][3][6][7]

## Fun Facts
- The first recorded performance of Miles Davis's composition 'Nardis' was on 'Portrait of Cannonball'; although written for Adderley, it became a signature tune for Bill Evans, who played it throughout his career.[4]
- On the album cover of 'Know What I Mean?', Bill Evans appears only in a small photograph beneath a sculpture, reflecting the album's focus on Adderley but hinting at Evans's crucial role.[3]
- The sessions for 'Know What I Mean?' were spread over several weeks due to the busy schedules of all four musicians, especially since Percy Heath and Connie Kay were also members of the Modern Jazz Quartet.[2][3]
- Adderley wanted 'Know What I Mean?' to break away from his popular soul-jazz style, building the concept around Evans's more introspective and harmonically sophisticated approach.[3]
