## Biography
Frank Kimbrough (November 2, 1956 – December 30, 2020) was an acclaimed American jazz pianist, composer, and educator, known for his lyrical touch and deep engagement with the post-bop tradition. Born in Roxboro, North Carolina, Kimbrough began playing piano at the age of three, initially learning hymns and later studying classical music. His exposure to jazz came in his mid-teens after seeing the Bill Evans Trio on television, a pivotal moment that inspired him to merge his classical discipline with the improvisational freedom of jazz[1][4].

After leaving college, Kimbrough pursued music full-time, first in Chapel Hill, then Washington, D.C., where he received mentorship from jazz elders like Shirley Horn and Andrew Hill. In 1981, he moved to New York City, immersing himself in the vibrant jazz scene and establishing himself through a long solo residency at the Village Corner. He released his first recordings in the mid-1980s and went on to record over twenty albums as a leader or co-leader, including notable works like 'Lullabluebye' and 'Play.' Kimbrough co-founded the Jazz Composers Collective and was a key member of the Herbie Nichols Project, Maria Schneider Orchestra, and Ryan Truesdell's Gil Evans Project. His playing was celebrated for its balance of mystery and clarity, and he was revered as a generous collaborator and improviser[1][2][3].

Kimbrough was also a dedicated educator, joining the Juilliard School faculty in 2008 and serving as interim chair of Jazz Studies in 2014. He mentored a new generation of jazz musicians, leaving a lasting legacy as both an artist and teacher. His influence extended through his recordings, collaborations, and the many students and peers who admired his artistry and spirit[3][5].
