## Biography
Mozelle Alderson, known by the alias Kansas City Kitty among others, was born Mozelle Fagans on November 20, 1904, in Bedford, Ohio. Little is known about her early life, but she married and relocated to Chicago, Illinois, where she established herself in the vibrant blues scene of the 1920s and 1930s. She began her recording career in 1927 with Black Patti Records, releasing singles such as 'Mobile Central Blues,' 'Tall Man Blues,' and 'Room Rent Blues,' accompanied by pianist Blind James Beck.[1]

Alderson's career peaked in the late 1920s and early 1930s, recording for labels including Brunswick, ARC, Vocalion, and Paramount. In 1930, she cut 'Tight Whoopee' backed with 'Tight in Chicago' with pianist Judson Brown, her most regular accompanist. She served as a one-time vocalist for the Famous Hokum Boys and contributed backing vocals on tracks like 'Alabama Scratch' with Big Bill Broonzy and Georgia Tom as the Harum Scarums in 1931. Her style embodied classic female blues, characterized by emotive vocals over piano accompaniment, though details of her musical development remain sparse due to limited documentation.[1][2]

Alderson was widowed by 1941 and remarried John Slocum in Chicago in 1943. She passed away in Chicago on February 15, 1994, at age 89. Her limited output has been preserved on compilation albums, contributing to the legacy of classic female blues singers, though her personal life outside recordings is largely unknown.[1]
