## Biography
Deadbolt is an American band formed in 1988 in San Diego, California, renowned for their unique blend of psychobilly, surf rock, rockabilly, and horror punk. Calling themselves the 'scariest band in the world,' Deadbolt developed a distinct style they dubbed 'voodoobilly,' characterized by dark, tongue-in-cheek lyrics inspired by horror and exploitation films, delivered over a backdrop of surf and rockabilly rhythms. The original trio included guitarist/vocalist Harley Davidson, bassist/vocalist Robert 'RA' MacLean, and drummer Les Vegas, with the lineup evolving over the years to include members like Gary '3rd Degree' Burns and Tank Johnson.

Throughout their career, Deadbolt became known for their theatrical live performances, which often featured power tools and visual effects, adding to their macabre mystique. Their discography spans more than a dozen albums, including cult favorites such as 'Shrunken Head,' 'Tiki Man,' and 'Tijuana Hit Squad.' The band’s music is noted for its offbeat storytelling, often taking listeners on wild journeys through haunted swamps, desolate highways, and pulp-inspired landscapes. Despite changes in the lineup and the passing of some members, Deadbolt has maintained a dedicated following and continues to perform, leaving a lasting legacy in the underground psychobilly and horror punk scenes.
