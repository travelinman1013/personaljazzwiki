## Biography
Nala Sinephro is a Belgian-Caribbean experimental jazz musician, composer, and producer born in 1996 in Brussels, Belgium[1][3][5]. Raised on the outskirts of Brussels near a forest, she was immersed in music from an early age: her mother was a classical piano teacher, and her father a jazz saxophonist from Martinique and Guadeloupe[1][3]. Sinephro's childhood was marked by a blend of classical and jazz influences, and her connection to nature would later inform her ambient soundscapes. During her teenage years, she overcame a serious health challenge—a tumor in her jaw—which led to a period of self-discovery and immersion in Brussels' club scene, where she developed a love for hardcore dance music[1][3]. Initially aspiring to be a biochemist, she switched to an arts-focused high school with a jazz department, where she discovered the harp—a pivotal moment in her musical development[1][3].

Sinephro briefly attended Berklee College of Music in Boston, but left after a year, finding more practical education as a sound engineer[1][3]. She relocated to London, where she became part of the vibrant jazz community, performing with the improvisational collective Steam Down and collaborating with the London Contemporary Orchestra[1][3]. Her debut album, "Space 1.8" (2021, Warp Records), was crafted through a minimalist and intentional approach, featuring her pedal harp and modular synthesizer, and included contributions from prominent London jazz musicians[1][3]. The album received widespread critical acclaim and appeared on several year-end lists[1][3]. Her second album, "Endlessness" (2024), further solidified her reputation for blending ambient, jazz, and experimental elements, and featured a broader array of collaborators[1].

Sinephro's music is characterized by its meditative, ambient qualities, intricate jazz harmonies, and the use of unconventional instrumentation such as pedal harp and modular synthesizer[1][3][5]. She is recognized for her innovative approach to composition, rooted in the study of frequency and geometry, and guided by the belief that sound moves matter[5]. In addition to her studio work, she has hosted her own NTS Radio show since 2020, and in 2025, she scored the A24 sports drama film "The Smashing Machine"[1]. Sinephro's legacy is marked by her role in shaping contemporary ambient jazz, her collaborations within London's jazz scene, and her influence on a new generation of experimental musicians[1][3][5].
