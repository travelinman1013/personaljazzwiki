## Biography
Acantha Lang is a soul and blues artist born and raised in the 9th Ward of New Orleans, Louisiana, where she grew up immersed in the city's rich musical heritage, though her passion for singing was initially kindled after moving to New York City. There, she purchased her first blues CD, assembled a blues show in Harlem that helped her discover her voice, and began performing at major blues festivals in the Caribbean and Africa, overcoming severe stage fright in the process. Now based in London, her career gained momentum with songwriting contributions to Robert Randolph & The Family Band's GRAMMY-nominated album *Got Soul*, leading to her acceptance into the Recording Academy's 2022 member class.[1][2][4][5][6][8]

Her debut album *Beautiful Dreams* (2023) reached #3 on the Official UK Jazz & Blues Albums Chart, earned 5-star reviews from Echoes and Soul Bag Magazine, and has amassed over 5 million streams worldwide. Lang's retro soul style draws heavily from influences like Gladys Knight, Aretha Franklin, and Mavis Staples, blending powerhouse vocals with funk-driven grooves, as praised by Blues & Soul Magazine. During the COVID-19 lockdown, she launched the *Standing On The Shoulders Of Soul Legends* YouTube series, covering classics in her living room—starting with a tribute to Bill Withers—which garnered 1.55 million views and 13 million+ video views, building a loyal fanbase without chasing viral trends.[1][3][7]

Lang has performed at prestigious venues and festivals including SXSW, Jazz Cafe (London), House of Blues and Blue Nile (New Orleans), Melkweg (Amsterdam), and Bizz’Art (Paris), with features on BBC Radio 2, Jazz FM, BBC 6Music’s A-List, and Craig Charles’ *Trunk of Funk Vol. 2*. Championed by DJs like Craig Charles, Trevor Nelson, and Gilles Peterson, she emphasizes authenticity, storytelling, and learning from soul pioneers over technical showmanship. A GRAMMY-nominated songwriter, she is currently preparing her second album for release in 2026.[1]
