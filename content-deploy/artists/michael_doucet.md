## Biography
Michael Doucet, born February 14, 1951, in Scott, Louisiana, is a pivotal figure in the revival and global recognition of Cajun music. Raised in a French-speaking Cajun family, Doucet was immersed in traditional music from an early age, learning banjo at six and guitar at eight. Early collaborations included a folk-rock band with his cousin Zachary Richard, but a transformative trip to France in 1974 inspired him to reconnect with his Cajun roots and dedicate himself to preserving and innovating the music of his heritage.

Doucet's career accelerated after he received a National Endowment for the Arts apprenticeship grant in 1975, which allowed him to study under master Cajun and Creole fiddlers. He soon founded the bands Coteau and, more enduringly, BeauSoleil, which became the most celebrated Cajun ensemble in the world. BeauSoleil's eclectic sound blends traditional Cajun music with blues, country, jazz, and zydeco, earning them multiple Grammy Awards and international acclaim. Doucet has also performed with the Savoy-Doucet Cajun Band and Fiddlers 4, and has been a passionate educator, teaching Cajun music at the University of Southwestern Louisiana and working to pass on the tradition to new generations.

Doucet's musical style is characterized by its deep respect for tradition, technical virtuosity, and willingness to innovate. His legacy as a performer, composer, and cultural ambassador has been recognized with honors such as the National Heritage Fellowship, and his influence continues to shape Cajun and American roots music.
