## Biography
Sasha Masakowski (born 1986) is an American vocalist, composer, and producer from **New Orleans, Louisiana**, known for blending modern jazz, electronic music, rock, and experimental art‑pop.[2][1][4] The daughter of renowned jazz guitarist **Steve Masakowski** and concert pianist and visual artist **Ulrike Antonie Sprenger**, she grew up in a highly musical household, exposed early to the New Orleans jazz tradition through her father’s association with Ellis Marsalis Jr. and the city’s vibrant club culture.[2][5][7] She studied Jazz Studies at the University of New Orleans, where her father led the jazz program, and began performing in college in adventurous free‑improvisation contexts, sometimes running her voice through distortion pedals and staging theatrical, improvised shows.[2][4]

Emerging on the New Orleans scene in 2009, Masakowski was quickly recognized as a leading young artist, earning the **Big Easy “Best Emerging Artist”** award and later being listed by **DownBeat Magazine** as one of twelve jazz artists to watch.[3][6][7] She has since toured widely, performing at major venues and festivals including the Blue Note (NYC), Jazz at Lincoln Center Shanghai, Cotton Club Tokyo, Detroit Jazz Festival, SFJAZZ Center, Copenhagen Jazz Festival, San Jose Jazz Festival, Bird’s Basement in Melbourne, and the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival.[1][3][4] Her discography and projects range from the acoustic‑leaning debut **“Wishes”** (Hypersoul, 2011), produced with pianist James Westfall, to the New Orleans–rooted modern jazz of **Art Market** and the experimental electronic art‑rock of **Tra$h Magnolia** and other projects such as Hildegard and Musical Playground.[2][1][3][5] In 2018 she became Artist‑in‑Residence for Denmark’s national arts program JazzDanmark, teaching composition and electronic production, recording with the Pagsberg Big Band, and touring nationwide; she subsequently signed with Ropeadope Records.[1] Her musical language is characterized by playful, fearless improvisation, heavy use of electronics, and an eclectic mix of jazz, synth‑pop, and art‑rock, leading critics to highlight her as a daring, genre‑defying voice in contemporary jazz.[1][3][4][5]

In recent years Masakowski has expanded her work as a producer and collaborator, splitting her time between New Orleans and Brooklyn, New York.[1] During the 2020 pandemic period she launched the livestream project **“Quarantined with Nick”** with trumpeter Nicholas Payton, later joining his **New World Order** trio (with guitarist Cliff Hines) at the Monterey Jazz Festival and Blue Note Jazz Festival in Napa.[1] In 2021 she co‑wrote and produced Thai singer **Rasmee**’s album **“Thong Lor Cowboy”** in Chiang Mai, contributing background vocals, synths, and electronic drums; the title track, written by Masakowski, reached #1 on Thai pop radio and the album was nominated “Album of the Year” by the Thai Pop Music Awards.[1] Through her teaching residencies, international touring, and genre‑bending recordings, Masakowski has become an influential figure linking New Orleans jazz heritage with a global, electronic‑infused, improvisational aesthetic, widely regarded as a sign of the music’s continued evolution and vitality.[1][4][5][7]
