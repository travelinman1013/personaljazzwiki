## Biography
D’Kieran “D.K.” Harrell is a guitarist, singer, and songwriter from Ruston, Louisiana, born on April 24, 1998, who has quickly emerged as one of the leading young voices in contemporary electric blues.[1][3][4] He first encountered the music of B.B. King as a toddler when his mother played King’s album *Deuces Wild* in the car; family members recall him singing along to “The Thrill Is Gone” from his car seat.[3][4] Growing up, he sang in his church choir and immersed himself in blues recordings, teaching himself guitar at home by playing along with audio and video clips and carefully studying the tone, phrasing, and stagecraft of his heroes.[1][3][4] He received his first guitar around age 12, began writing his own songs by 16, and drew heavily on classic blues and soul-blues while also being inspired by films like *The Blues Brothers*, *Cadillac Records*, and *Ray*.[3][4]

Harrell’s first major break came when he was invited to perform at the B.B. King Symposium and related events at the B.B. King Museum in Indianola, Mississippi, where he played “The Thrill Is Gone” on King’s famed guitar “Lucille,” backed by members of King’s touring band.[3][4][6] From there he advanced to the finals of the International Blues Challenge and began appearing at prominent blues festivals, developing a reputation as a compelling live performer with stinging, single‑note string bends, deep soul vocals, and original songs that honor the tradition while sounding contemporary.[2][4][5] In 2022 he received the B.B. King “King of the Blues” Award from the Jus’ Blues Music Foundation for preserving traditional blues heritage, and his 2023 debut album *The Right Man* on Little Village Records earned rave reviews and led to a Blues Music Award for Best Emerging Artist from The Blues Foundation.[1][2][3][4] His follow‑up album *Talkin’ Heavy*, released on Alligator Records, further solidified his status as a leading figure in the new blues generation, showcasing hard‑grooving modern electric blues rooted firmly in the legacies of B.B. King, Albert King, Freddie King, Elmore James, and Muddy Waters.[1][2][3][5][7]

Musically, Harrell is often described as a Louisiana “new bluesman” whose style blends traditional electric blues with soul, R&B, and blues‑rock, delivered with the fervor of a revival‑tent preacher.[1][2][5] Critics note that while he draws deeply from B.B. King’s vocabulary—especially in his string bends, economy of notes, and vocal‑guitar dialogue—he has developed a distinct voice that avoids imitation, emphasizing narrative songwriting and emotionally charged performances.[2][4][5][8] As a major draw at blues festivals around the world and an artist explicitly committed to carrying classic blues into the future, Harrell is frequently cited as a “leading light” of his generation, helping to keep the B.B. King lineage and broader electric blues tradition alive for new audiences.[5][7][8]

## Fun Facts
- As a toddler, Harrell reportedly sang along to B.B. King’s duet version of “The Thrill Is Gone” from a car seat when his mother played the *Deuces Wild* album in the family car.[3][4]
- His first significant public performance as a blues artist was at a B.B. King Symposium event, where he played “The Thrill Is Gone” on B.B. King’s own guitar, Lucille, backed by King’s touring band.[3][4][6]
- Harrell’s first public appearance as a bluesman and his rapid rise from obscurity were significant enough to be profiled in *Living Blues* magazine and other major blues publications early in his career.[4][6]
- Before performing widely on stage, Harrell spent years practicing alone at home, teaching himself by playing along with recordings and videos rather than coming up through a local club circuit.[4]

## Musical Connections

### Mentors/Influences
- [[b.b._king|B.B. King]] - Primary musical idol and stylistic model; Harrell intensely studied King’s recordings, videos, tone, phrasing, stage presence, and band leadership and later performed at multiple B.B. King Museum events. (Influenced Harrell’s approach heard on *The Right Man* (2023) and *Talkin’ Heavy* (Alligator Records), especially in songs modeled on King’s single‑note bends and vocal‑guitar interplay.) [Early 2000s (first exposure as a toddler) through present; formal association via B.B. King Museum events from 2019 onward.[1][3][4][6][8]]
- [[albert_king|Albert King]] - Key stylistic influence in Harrell’s electric blues guitar approach, especially powerful bends and vocal‑like phrasing. (General influence audible across Harrell’s lead guitar work on *The Right Man* and *Talkin’ Heavy* rather than a specific tribute recording.) [Teen years onward as Harrell absorbed recordings of classic electric blues masters.[1][3]]
- [[freddie_king|Freddie King]] - Influential as part of the classic electric blues trio of guitar “Kings” whose attack and drive inform Harrell’s modern sound. (Referenced by Harrell and festival bios as a core influence reflected in his uptempo, riff‑driven songs.) [Teen years onward as he broadened beyond B.B. King into other major blues stylists.[1][3]]
- [[elmore_james|Elmore James]] - Influence on Harrell’s incorporation of traditional blues vocabulary, particularly classic electric blues textures and phrasing. (Stylistic influence heard in Harrell’s treatment of shuffles and slow blues on *The Right Man*.) [Ongoing influence as part of his study of traditional blues masters.[1][3]]
- [[muddy_waters|Muddy Waters]] - Foundational influence from the Chicago blues tradition that Harrell has integrated into his musical vocabulary. (General influence on Harrell’s band‑focused electric blues sound rather than a specific track.) [Ongoing influence since he immersed himself in classic blues recordings.[1][3]]

### Key Collaborators
- [[members_of_b.b._kings_touring_band|Members of B.B. King’s touring band]] - Backing band for Harrell’s first major professional appearance, where he performed “The Thrill Is Gone” on King’s guitar Lucille at the B.B. King Symposium / B.B. King Museum events. (Live performance of “The Thrill Is Gone” at the B.B. King Symposium and related museum events in Indianola, Mississippi.) [2019 and subsequent B.B. King Museum performances.[3][4][6]]
- [[gary_clark_jr|Gary Clark Jr.]] - Shared the stage at festival settings, underscoring Harrell’s acceptance among leading contemporary guitarists. (Festival performances documented in coverage of Harrell’s rising career.) [Early 2020s festival appearances.[4]]
- [[soul_nite_backing_band_at_international_blues_challenge|Soul Nite (backing band at International Blues Challenge)]] - Band with which Harrell competed at the International Blues Challenge in Memphis, ultimately reaching the finals.
