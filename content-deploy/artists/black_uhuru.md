## Biography
Black Uhuru is a pioneering reggae group formed in 1972 in the Waterhouse district of Kingston, Jamaica, by Derrick 'Duckie' Simpson, Don Carlos, and Garth Dennis. The name 'Uhuru' means 'freedom' in Swahili, reflecting the group's roots in the Rastafarian faith and their commitment to themes of liberation and social justice. Their early recordings, including a cover of The Impressions' 'Romancing to the Folk Song,' saw limited success, leading to lineup changes as Carlos and Dennis departed for other projects.

Simpson reassembled the group with Michael Rose and Errol Nelson, later replaced by Puma Jones, and began collaborating with the legendary rhythm section Sly Dunbar and Robbie Shakespeare. This lineup defined Black Uhuru's signature sound: deep bass, driving drums, sharp keyboards, and echo-laden vocals. The band gained international acclaim in the late 1970s and 1980s with albums like 'Love Crisis,' 'Red,' and 'Anthem'—the latter earning them the first-ever Grammy Award for Best Reggae Album in 1985. Black Uhuru's music blends roots reggae, dub, and rocksteady, and their lyrics often address Rastafarian spirituality, political struggle, and African identity.

Over five decades, Black Uhuru has remained one of Jamaica's most influential and enduring reggae acts, second only to Bob Marley & The Wailers in global impact and record sales. Their innovative sound and powerful messages have made them ambassadors of reggae, influencing countless artists and maintaining a prominent place in the genre's history.
