## Biography
Jesse "Tiny" Crump was a Texas-born pianist and organist who became a significant figure in Indianapolis's early 20th-century music scene. Born in Dallas, Crump traveled as a young pianist in the Negro Vaudeville circuit before arriving in Indianapolis in 1923 at just seventeen years old. He quickly established himself at the Golden West Cafe on Indiana Avenue, one of the city's premier entertainment venues, where he performed regularly and became known among local musicians for his versatility across multiple genres.

During his career, Crump recorded jazz, blues, and ragtime music, demonstrating remarkable stylistic range. His two piano solos recorded in 1923 for Gennett Records—"Mr. Crump Rag" and "Golden West Blues"—showcased his ability to work in both novelty ragtime and blues styles. Beyond his solo work, Crump became best known for his prolific songwriting and accompaniment work with blues singer Ida Cox, for whom he composed numerous songs including "Death Letter Blues," "Black Crepe Blues," "Cherry Pickin' Blues," and "Last Mile Blues." He also backed other notable Indianapolis and touring musicians, establishing himself as a reliable and creative accompanist.

Crump's career was interrupted by military service overseas from 1942 to 1945, after which he struggled with a nervous condition that prevented him from making music professionally. He returned to Indianapolis where he worked in a cafe until his death on April 21, 1974. Though his recorded output was limited, Crump's contributions to Indianapolis's blues and ragtime traditions and his songwriting for Ida Cox secured his place in the city's musical history.

## Fun Facts
- Crump arrived in Indianapolis at just seventeen years old in 1923 and immediately began performing at the prestigious Golden West Cafe on Indiana Avenue, one of the city's most important music venues.
- His two piano solos from 1923 are stylistically distinct—"Mr. Crump Rag" is in a novelty ragtime style while "Golden West Blues" demonstrates his blues capabilities, showcasing his versatility across genres.
- Crump was part of Indianapolis's vibrant piano player community in the 1920s, performing alongside other notable pianists including Russell Smith, Russell Williams, and Frank Hines, making the city a significant hub for piano music.
- Despite his prolific songwriting for Ida Cox and other artists, Crump's recorded output as a solo artist was extremely limited, with only two known piano solos from 1923, making him a somewhat obscure figure despite his influence on Indianapolis's music scene.
