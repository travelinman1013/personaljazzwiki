## Biography
Clark Virgil Terry Jr. was born on December 14, 1920, in St. Louis, Missouri, where he began playing trumpet as a teenager and launched his professional career in the early 1940s. After serving in the US Navy during World War II, Terry's musical star rose rapidly through successful stints with bandleaders George Hudson, Charlie Barnet, Eddie Vinson, and Charlie Ventura. His prominence became firmly established in 1948 when he joined Count Basie's legendary big band for three years, followed by an even more significant eight-year tenure with Duke Ellington's renowned orchestra beginning in 1951, where he served as a featured soloist and participated in many of the composer's ambitious suites.

Terry's innovative approach blended the characteristic St. Louis tone with contemporary styles ranging from swing to hard bop, and he became a pioneer of the flugelhorn in jazz, influencing generations of musicians. His exuberant, swinging horn playing and technical proficiency, combined with his engaging sense of humor, made him a distinctive stylist capable of adding a unique element to any musical setting. Beyond his work with major orchestras, Terry achieved historic significance when he became the first African American staff musician on a major US television network, joining NBC's Tonight Show band in 1960—a position he held for twelve years, which helped popularize jazz to a broader audience and broke significant racial barriers in American media.

Throughout his career spanning more than 70 years, Clark Terry became one of the most recorded jazz musicians in history, appearing on over 900 recordings as both a bandleader and sideman. His greatest passion outside of performing was jazz education; he mentored numerous musicians who would become jazz legends, conducted extensive jazz workshops, co-founded Jazz Mobile in Harlem, and hosted Clark Terry Jazz Festivals on land and sea from 2000 onwards. Terry performed for eight U.S. Presidents, served as a Jazz Ambassador for State Department tours in the Middle East and Africa, and received numerous honors including a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2010. He passed away on February 21, 2015, leaving behind an unparalleled legacy as a consummate musician, educator, and cultural ambassador.
