## Biography
Polka Dot Slim, born Willie Monroe Vincent on December 9, 1926, in Woodville, Mississippi, was an American blues singer and harmonica player who became a notable figure in the New Orleans blues scene. Performing from a young age, he developed a style that blended New Orleans rhythm and blues with the rural country blues tradition, drawing particular influence from Sonny Boy Williamson II. His early recordings in the late 1950s were produced in Crowley, Louisiana, by Jay Miller, who released them under various pseudonyms on different labels.

Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Polka Dot Slim was a regular performer in New Orleans clubs and bars, where his music was characterized by its raw, rural blues sound amidst a city known for its more urbanized R&B. He recorded notable tracks such as "A Thing You Gotta Face" and "Ain't Broke Ain't Hungry," produced by Sax Kari and released on the Instant label in 1964. Music historian John Broven described him as one of the last rural country bluesmen active in New Orleans during the 1970s. In his later years, Polka Dot Slim relocated to Oakland, California, where he continued to perform until his death on June 22, 1981.
