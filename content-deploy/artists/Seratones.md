## Biography
Seratones are a dynamic funk-rock and retro soul band hailing from Shreveport, Louisiana, formed in 2013. The group was born out of the Louisiana club circuit, where frontwoman A.J. Haynes (vocals, guitar), Connor Davis (lead guitar), Jesse Gabriel (drums), and Adam Davis (bass) honed their craft in the region’s vibrant DIY scene. Their early years were marked by relentless gigging, late-night listening parties, and a collaborative songwriting process that drew from the deep musical traditions surrounding them—jazz from New Orleans, Mississippi delta blues, Memphis rock ‘n’ roll, gospel, and punk[2][4]. 

The band’s debut album, 'Get Gone' (2016), released on Fat Possum Records, quickly garnered critical acclaim and national attention, including a celebrated NPR Tiny Desk Concert. Their sound—a melting pot of garage rock, blues, soul, and punk—was further refined on subsequent albums, 'Power' (2019, New West Records) and 'Love & Algorhythms' (2022, New West Records). A.J. Haynes’s gospel-trained vocals, combined with the group’s genre-blending approach, have positioned Seratones as innovators redefining Southern rock and soul for a new generation[1][7]. 

Beyond their music, Seratones are known for their commitment to activism and social justice, particularly through Haynes’s advocacy for reproductive rights. Their work is deeply informed by Black feminist thought and Afrofuturism, with Haynes seeking to honor the Black matriarchal lineage of rock and roll while pushing the boundaries of genre and performance. The band’s legacy is one of joyful resistance, artistic innovation, and a celebration of the transformative power of music[1][4].
