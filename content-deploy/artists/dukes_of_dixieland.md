## Biography
The Dukes of Dixieland originated in New Orleans in 1948, founded by teenage brothers Frank Assunto (trumpet) and Fred Assunto (trombone), who began playing professionally in 1946 at venues like Mama Lou's on Lake Pontchartrain, often alongside a young Pete Fountain. Initially performing as the Basin Street Four, Five, or Six, they rebranded as the Junior Dixieland Band and won a local talent contest for the Horace Heidt Pot O’Gold radio show in 1949, earning a tour spot and national runner-up status, which propelled them to professionalism. They officially became the Dukes of Dixieland around 1950-1951, recording their first sessions that year, achieving success in Chicago, Las Vegas (64 weeks at the Thunderbird in 1956), and releasing early LPs like one for Vik in 1955 featuring 'Bourbon Street Parade.' The original era ended after Fred's death in 1966, with Frank continuing selectively.[1][2][3][4][5][6]

In 1974, producer John Shoup revived the Dukes to preserve Dixieland music, hiring cornetist Connie Jones (formerly with Pete Fountain) as leader for their debut concert with the Chicago Pops at Grant Park. The current incarnation, stable since 1974, has performed hundreds of symphony concerts, festivals, and tours worldwide, recording over 20 albums including the first Dixieland CD in 1984 and 'Deep South Blues' in 2008. Home bases included Dukes Place (1974-1986), Mahogany Hall (1986-1992), and since 1992, the Steamboat Natchez riverboat, blending traditional New Orleans Dixieland jazz with orchestral and modern elements.[1][2][8]

The band's enduring legacy lies in revitalizing Dixieland through innovative recordings (e.g., direct-to-disk in 1981, Bose recordings for Mercedes in 1998) and high-profile events like PBS specials, international tours (e.g., Turkey 1996), and collaborations with groups like the Victory Belles in 2018. Leaders have included Connie Jones, Mike Vax (ex-Stan Kenton), Otis Bazoon, Frank Trapani, and later Kevin Clark, maintaining a core New Orleans sound while adapting to contemporary venues and technologies.[1][2]
