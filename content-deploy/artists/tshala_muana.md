## Biography
Élisabeth Tshala Muana Muidikay, known professionally as Tshala Muana, was born on March 13, 1958, in Lubumbashi, Democratic Republic of the Congo. She grew up singing in church and, after her father's death, moved with her family first to Kananga and then to Kinshasa, where she began her professional career in the mid-1970s as a dancer for bands such as Tsheke Tsheke Love and Minzoto Wella Wella. Her early exposure to the traditional Mutuashi rhythms of the Kasai region profoundly shaped her musical identity.

Muana transitioned to singing in the late 1970s, quickly gaining recognition for her powerful voice and dynamic stage presence. She recorded her first single in Paris in 1982 and collaborated with leading African musicians, including Cameroonian bassist Aladji Touré and Congolese guitarist Rigo Star. Over her career, she released more than 20 albums and became known as the 'Queen of Mutuashi,' popularizing the genre both in Congo and internationally. Her music blended Mutuashi with rumba congolaise, ndombolo, and other African styles, and she toured extensively across Africa and Europe, earning numerous awards and accolades.

Tshala Muana's legacy is marked by her role in elevating Congolese music and dance on the global stage. She was a trailblazer for female artists in Africa, inspiring a generation of musicians with her innovative fusion of traditional and contemporary sounds. Her influence extended beyond music into politics and social advocacy, and she remained a prominent cultural figure until her death in Kinshasa on December 10, 2022.
