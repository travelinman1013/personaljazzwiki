## Biography
Jack Wilkins, born June 4, 1944, in Brooklyn, New York, to a musical family—his father played saxophone and trombone, and his mother was a self-taught singer and pianist—began playing guitar at age 13. Initially swept up by rock 'n' roll via Chuck Berry, he was introduced to jazz by an older cousin's records of Charlie Christian, Tal Farlow, Johnny Smith, and Django Reinhardt. He studied fundamentals with Joe Monti, advanced music with Sid Margolis, jazz with John Mehegan, and classical guitar with Rodrigo Riera, while performing professionally in his teens with bandleaders like Les Elgart, Warren Covington, and Sammy Kaye.[1][2][4][8]

Wilkins emerged on the international jazz scene in the early 1970s, recording his debut album *Windows* in 1973 with Mike Moore and Bill Goodwin on Mainstream Records. Renowned for his flawless technique, imaginative chordal approach, and role as a consummate accompanist, he gained prominence in Buddy Rich's septet (1971-1974), featuring Sonny Fortune, Sal Nistico, Kenny Barron, and Anthony Jackson, and contributed to live recordings like *Very Live at Buddy’s Place*. He released over 15 albums as a leader, including *Merge* (with Randy and Michael Brecker, Eddie Gómez, Jack DeJohnette), *Alien Army*, and collaborations with Chet Baker via Creed Taylor, while working as a studio player and accompanist for singers like Mel Tormé, Sarah Vaughan, Ray Charles, Tony Bennett, Morgana King, and Manhattan Transfer. A fixture in New York clubs like Zinc, Mezzrow, and Bar Next Door, he received an NEA grant for his contributions to jazz guitar.[1][2][3][4][5]

Wilkins passed away on May 5, 2023, in New York City at age 78 after months of failing health. His legacy endures through his versatile style—blending jazz mastery with explorations into fusion, complex chord substitutions inspired by John Coltrane and Pat Martino, and synthetic scales—over four decades in the New York jazz scene, Broadway shows like *Jacques Brel Is Alive and Well*, and tours with Peter Yarrow and Manhattan Transfer.[2][3][4][6]

## Fun Facts
- Wilkins created album titles using anagrams, such as *Call Him Reckless* (1989) derived from 'Michael Clark' (drummer Mike Clark) with extra letters added.
- Creed Taylor once picked him up in a limo at 10 AM for an impromptu recording session with Chet Baker at Rudy Van Gelder’s studio in New Jersey.
- He briefly worked with a young Barry Manilow as an arranger and vibraphonist.
- Despite his talent, early colleague Michael Moore noted Wilkins sometimes felt insecure about playing standards in guitar battles against John Abercrombie, prompting him to compose more originals.
