## Biography
Rosemary Clooney was born on May 23, 1928, in Maysville, Kentucky, and rose from a challenging childhood to become one of America's most beloved vocalists. She began her career singing duets with her younger sister Betty on Cincinnati radio in the mid-1940s, which led to touring with Tony Pastor's big band. By 1949, Clooney struck out as a solo artist in New York, quickly signing with Columbia Records. Her 1951 recording of 'Come On-a My House' became a major hit, launching a series of pop and novelty songs such as 'Mambo Italiano,' 'Tenderly,' and 'Hey There,' while also establishing her as a versatile interpreter of jazz and ballads.[1][4][6][7]

Clooney's style was marked by a warm, rich voice and an unpretentious delivery, making her a favorite among both pop and jazz audiences. She appeared in films, most notably 'White Christmas' (1954), and hosted her own television variety show. After facing personal and professional setbacks in the 1960s, including struggles with mental health, Clooney made a celebrated comeback in the late 1970s, focusing on jazz standards and recording acclaimed albums for Concord Jazz. Her later work was noted for its emotional depth and interpretive maturity, and she continued to perform and record until her death in 2002. Clooney's legacy endures as a bridge between the big band era and modern vocal jazz, and she was honored with a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2002.[1][4][7]

Clooney's influence extended beyond her own recordings; she was admired for her impeccable timing, phrasing, and ability to convey both joy and heartbreak. She worked with legendary arrangers and musicians, and her interpretations of the American Songbook remain benchmarks for vocalists today.[1][3][4]
