## Biography
Bobby Thurston, born in 1954 in Washington, D.C., is an American disco and funk singer best known for his energetic contributions to the post-disco era. He began his musical journey in high school, singing backing vocals and playing congas with the group Spectrum Ltd, eventually becoming their lead singer while simultaneously working at the State Department[1][2][5][6]. Thurston's big break came when producers Willie Lester and Ronnie Brown discovered him during a performance and brought him to the Prelude label, where they wrote and produced his debut album 'You Got What It Takes.' The album featured the UK Top 10 hit 'Check Out The Groove' in 1980 and a cover of Billy Stewart's classic 'Sitting In The Park'[1][2][3][4].

Following his initial success, Thurston released 'The Main Attraction' in 1981, which included the popular track 'Very Last Drop.' He later moved to Lester and Brown's own label, Mainline, for the album 'Sweetest Piece Of The Pie,' featuring Al Johnson on keyboards and arrangements. His music is characterized by a blend of disco, funk, and R&B, with grooving basslines, soulful vocals, and danceable rhythms that captured the spirit of late 1970s and early 1980s club culture[1][2][4].

Though Thurston's mainstream output was limited to a few albums, his work remains influential in the post-disco and funk scenes, particularly in the UK where his singles found chart success. His legacy is marked by his ability to bridge classic soul with the evolving sounds of disco and funk, leaving a lasting impression on dance music enthusiasts and collectors[1][2][3][4].
