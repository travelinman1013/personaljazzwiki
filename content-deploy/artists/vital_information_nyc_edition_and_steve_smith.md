## Biography
Steve Smith and Vital Information represents a unique convergence of rock virtuosity and jazz mastery. Steve Smith, who grew up near Boston, began his drumming journey in 1963 with jazz instruction from a local teacher, establishing jazz as his foundational musical language. His early exposure to jazz drummers like Mitch Mitchell of the Jimi Hendrix Experience and later fusion pioneers shaped his approach to rhythm as interpretive and conversational rather than strictly metronomic. Smith's career trajectory took a dramatic turn when he joined the rock band Journey in 1978, where he remained for seven years and played on some of their most iconic hits including "Don't Stop Believin'," "Separate Ways," and "Faithfully," bringing his jazz sensibilities to arena rock and introducing his playing to millions of listeners worldwide.[3] However, jazz remained his true home base, and since 1983 he has led Vital Information, a jazz fusion ensemble that has evolved through various incarnations over four decades, releasing 17 albums and touring extensively.[3][6] The Vital Information NYC Edition represents a stylistic meeting point between Smith's fusion-oriented group and straight-ahead jazz traditions, showcasing his ability to bridge the raw, pioneering energy of 1970s fusion with contemporary 21st-century global jazz sensibilities.[2][5]
