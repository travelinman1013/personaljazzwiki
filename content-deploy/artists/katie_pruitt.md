## Biography
Katie Pruitt, born Katherine Nicole Pruitt on March 4, 1994, in the suburbs of Atlanta, Georgia—with early roots also noted in Baltimore—grew up in the Christian South, where she navigated complex personal experiences including her queer identity, religion, and mental health challenges. These themes profoundly shaped her songwriting, as she transitioned from serving as a music minister at an African Methodist Episcopal church to pursuing a career in music, eventually transplanting to Nashville, Tennessee. Her early recognition came through awards like the 2016 BMI Songwriting Scholarship for 'Ordinary' and the 2017 Buddy Holly Prize from the Songwriters Hall of Fame, alongside performances at festivals such as Pilgrimage.[3][5][7]

Pruitt's career gained momentum with the 2018 Ourvinyl live EP, earning her NPR Slingshot Artist status in 2019 and features on All Songs Considered. Her debut album *Expectations* (2020) candidly explored growing up queer in the South, earning an Americana Music Association nomination for Emerging Artist of the Year and praise from Rolling Stone and Pitchfork for its empathetic storytelling and eloquent vocals. Influenced by Joni Mitchell, Bonnie Raitt, and Amy Winehouse, her style blends simple, evocative melodies with folk-leaning sounds, indie-rock experimentation, propulsive grooves, and overdriven guitars. Her sophomore album *Mantras* (released later) delved deeper into gender identity, self-compassion, and personal growth, produced mainly by Collin Pastore and Jake Finch.[1][2][4][6]

Now a prominent Nashville-based singer-songwriter-guitarist, Pruitt's music emphasizes emotional honesty, human relationships, and transformation, with sold-out shows, international tours, and festival appearances at Americana, 420 Fest, Pilgrimage, and SXSW's Luck Reunion. Her work continues to resonate, proving music's power to impact lives through raw, incisive self-examination.[3][4]
