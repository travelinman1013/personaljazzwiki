## Biography
Claude Driskett Hopkins (August 24, 1903 – February 19, 1984) was a distinguished American jazz stride pianist, arranger, and bandleader, born in Alexandria, Virginia. Raised in an academic family—both parents were on the faculty at Howard University—Hopkins began studying piano at age seven and later attended Howard University and the Washington Conservatory, where he played in college bands and honed his craft[1][4].

Hopkins launched his professional career in his early twenties, first joining the Wilbur Sweatman Orchestra as a sideman before becoming the musical director for Josephine Baker’s celebrated 'Revue Negre' in Europe, which also featured Sidney Bechet[1][2][4]. Returning to the United States in 1927, he led the Ginger Snaps Revue and soon took over Charlie Skeete’s band, establishing himself as a prominent Harlem bandleader during the 1930s. His orchestra held long residencies at premier venues like the Savoy Ballroom, Roseland Ballroom, and the Cotton Club, and was known for its sophisticated arrangements and Hopkins’s virtuosic stride piano style[1][3][5].

Although his big band never achieved the enduring fame of contemporaries like Duke Ellington or Count Basie, Hopkins’s music was widely broadcast on national radio and featured in several musical shorts and films. After disbanding his orchestra in the early 1940s, he continued to perform and record with small groups, collaborating with leading jazz musicians and remaining active in the New York jazz scene for decades. Hopkins’s elegant, melodic approach and arranging skills left a lasting imprint on jazz, earning him the nickname 'Crazy Fingers' for his dazzling piano technique[1][4][5].

## Fun Facts

- Hopkins and his band appeared in several musical shorts and films, including 'Dance Team,' 'Wayward,' and 'Barbershop Blues'[3][5].
- During World War II, Hopkins worked as an inspector at the Eastern Aircraft Factory and led the company's Wild Cat Band[3].
