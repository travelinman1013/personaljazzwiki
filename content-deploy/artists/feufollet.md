## Biography
Feufollet is an Americana/Cajun band from Lafayette, Louisiana that formed in 1995 (some sources cite 1998) when founding member Chris Stafford was just 11 years old and his half-brother Mike was 8. The band's name references a feu follet, or will-o'-the-wisp—a mythical creature found in Louisiana swamplands known for luring travelers from their path, perfectly capturing the band's genre-bending approach to traditional music. The young musicians were products of Lafayette's French immersion schools and began their journey under the tutelage of renowned Cajun musician Steve Riley, himself a student of the legendary Dewey Balfa. The band quickly gained recognition in their community for being young people embracing Cajun culture and performing in French, with audiences believing in their authentic connection to the tradition.

Throughout their nearly three-decade career, Feufollet evolved from traditional Cajun prodigies into genre-defying innovators. Their 2010 album *En Couleurs* marked a breakthrough moment, earning a Grammy nomination for Best Zydeco or Cajun Music Album and catching the attention of Elvis Costello, who name-dropped them in a magazine interview. The album also garnered features on NPR and endorsement from The New York Times for their experimental tendencies. However, this success also highlighted a challenge: in their mid-20s, they found themselves being cornered into a genre dominated by artists in their 50s and 60s. In 2012, founding vocalist Anna Laura Edmiston (who had been with the band since 2003) left to join a touring circus group, and was replaced by Kelli Jones-Savoy, a multi-instrumentalist from South Carolina with Appalachian fiddle roots and strong country music sensibilities.

The band's sound continued to evolve with *Two Universes* (2015), their first album of mostly-English songs largely composed by Jones-Savoy, marking a deliberate shift toward rock and Americana venues rather than folklife festivals. Feufollet's musical palette expanded to incorporate honky-tonk, country harmonies, string-band music, and even psychedelic influences, while maintaining their Cajun foundation with traditional elements like accordion and fiddle. The addition of keyboardist Andrew Toups from a rock background further diversified their sound. Tragically, founding member Chris Stafford passed away unexpectedly on May 2, 2024, at age 36, leaving behind an incredible legacy as a pillar of the Lafayette music scene and one of the greatest success stories of Louisiana's French immersion education program.

## Fun Facts
- The band's name 'Feufollet' refers to a will-o'-the-wisp, a mythical creature in Louisiana folklore that lures travelers from their path—perfectly capturing the band's tendency to lead listeners away from traditional Cajun music into unexpected musical territory.
- When the band originally formed in the late 1990s, the members were aged between 8 and 17, with many already being serial competition winners on their instruments. Chris Stafford began playing music at age 8 and founded the band when he was only 11 years old.
- Anna Laura Edmiston, the band's singer from 2003-2012 who fronted their Grammy-nominated album *En Couleurs*, left the band to join a touring circus group—a departure so unusual that one journalist noted it 'probably deserves its own article.'
- Elvis Costello became a fan of Feufollet and name-dropped them in a magazine interview after hearing their 2010 album *En Couleurs*, helping to bring the band national attention beyond the Cajun music circuit.
