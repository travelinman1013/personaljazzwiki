## Biography
Victor Stanley Feldman (1934–1987) was an English jazz musician renowned for his mastery of piano, vibraphone, and percussion. Born in Edgware, Middlesex, England, Feldman was a child prodigy, performing professionally by the age of seven and quickly gaining recognition for his extraordinary talent. He began his career as a drummer, playing with his brothers in the Feldman Trio and even performing with Glenn Miller’s Army Air Force Band as a young boy. His early fame led to appearances in films and on BBC broadcasts, and by his teens, he had expanded his repertoire to include piano and vibraphone. Feldman’s family was deeply musical, and his father founded the Feldman Swing Club in London to showcase his sons’ talents.

Feldman moved to the United States in the mid-1950s, where he became a prominent figure in the West Coast jazz scene. He recorded with major jazz artists such as Woody Herman, Buddy DeFranco, Cannonball Adderley, and Miles Davis, contributing notably to Davis’s classic album 'Seven Steps to Heaven,' which featured Feldman’s own composition. While he was a respected jazz musician, Feldman also became a prolific session player, working with a wide range of pop and rock artists including Steely Dan, Frank Zappa, Tom Waits, and Joe Walsh. His versatility and skill made him one of the most sought-after studio musicians in Los Angeles. Feldman’s legacy endures through his influential recordings, his contributions to both jazz and popular music, and his reputation as one of Britain’s finest jazz musicians.
