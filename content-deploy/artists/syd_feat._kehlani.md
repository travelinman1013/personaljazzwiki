## Biography
Syd (Sydney Loren Bennett), born April 23, 1992, in Los Angeles, California, is an American singer, songwriter, and producer who has established herself as a multifaceted artist across multiple musical projects and genres. She initially gained recognition as the only female member of the alternative hip hop collective Odd Future, where she served as a DJ and producer while also contributing vocals to the group's tracks. Despite the group's notoriously homophobic and misogynistic lyrical content, Syd openly identified as gay and used her platform to challenge these narratives from within the collective. In 2011, she co-founded The Internet, an electronic soul band that would become critically acclaimed, earning a Grammy nomination by 2015 and releasing three albums during their initial run.

Transitioning into her solo career in 2017, Syd released her debut studio album Fin, which marked her third act as an independent artist and songwriter. Her approach to music-making is characterized by both meticulous control and collaborative spirit—she carefully selects her own collaborators and arranges features through direct communication rather than relying on traditional A&R channels. Syd's musical style effortlessly navigates between R&B, hip-hop, jazz, funk, and electronic music, reflecting her diverse influences and production background. Her 2022 album Broken Hearts Club showcased her continued evolution as an artist, featuring collaborations with artists including Kehlani and Smino, and demonstrated her role as both a performer and producer who crafted much of the album's sonic landscape.

Throughout her career, Syd has maintained a reputation as a skilled producer and songwriter willing to explore unconventional sonic territories. Her work spans from her early days recording in her home studio (known as "The Trap") with Odd Future to her sophisticated production choices on her solo albums. In 2014, she opened for Eminem at Wembley Stadium as part of the Odd Future collective, and she has continued to build her presence as a solo artist while remaining connected to the broader Los Angeles music community.

## Fun Facts
- Syd's stage name was originally given to her by her older brother Ty when she was a kid; she reclaimed the name when joining Odd Future after initially growing out of it
- Most of Odd Future's original songs were recorded in Syd's house, which the collective nicknamed 'The Trap'
- On her 2022 album Broken Hearts Club, Syd produced three or four tracks herself and personally reached out to featured artists via direct message (DM) rather than having an A&R handle collaborations, demonstrating her hands-on approach to the creative process
- Despite being the only female member of Odd Future during the group's active years, Syd openly identified as gay and frequently found herself at odds with the group's notoriously homophobic and misogynistic lyrics, making her presence in the collective a notable statement
