## Biography
Charlie Barnet, born Charles Daly Barnet on October 26, 1913, in New York City, was a prominent American jazz saxophonist, composer, and bandleader best known for his contributions to the swing era. Raised in a wealthy family, Barnet was expected to pursue a career in law, but he chose music instead, learning piano and saxophone as a child. He began performing professionally as a teenager, working with Jean Goldkette’s band and later forming his own big band in New York. Barnet’s career flourished in the late 1930s and 1940s, with his orchestra gaining acclaim for its energetic performances and adventurous arrangements. His band was notable for its strong brass section and for incorporating a variety of musical styles, including blues and swing, which gave it a distinctive sound often described as having a 'black sound' despite being a white-led ensemble.

Barnet’s major recordings include 'Cherokee,' 'Skyliner,' 'Nagasaki,' 'The Wrong Idea,' 'Scotch and Soda,' 'In a Mizz,' and 'Southland Shuffle.' He was known for pushing boundaries in both performance and arrangement, helping to shape the evolution of jazz during the big band era. Barnet’s orchestra was the first white band to play the Apollo Theater in Harlem, breaking house records and earning critical acclaim. In the late 1940s, he formed a progressive concert jazz orchestra, but eventually retired from active bandleading in 1949 due to changing musical tastes. He remained involved in music through management and occasional performances, and his legacy endures as a pioneering figure in swing and big band jazz.
