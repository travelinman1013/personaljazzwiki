## Biography
Johnny St. Cyr was born John Alexander St. Cyr on April 17, 1890, in New Orleans, Louisiana, and became one of the foundational figures in early jazz as a banjoist and guitarist[1][2][3]. Growing up in the birthplace of jazz, he was largely self-taught and began leading his own bands as early as 1905, quickly immersing himself in the city’s vibrant musical scene[6]. By his teens, he was performing with prominent local groups such as A.J. Piron’s orchestra and the Superior, Olympia, and Tuxedo bands, before joining Kid Ory’s band in 1918[6][8]. In 1923, St. Cyr moved to Chicago, where he became an integral part of the burgeoning jazz recording industry, working with legends like King Oliver, Jelly Roll Morton, and, most notably, Louis Armstrong[1][3][6].

St. Cyr’s musical style was marked by innovation and adaptability. He pioneered the use of the banjo in jazz, often modifying his instruments—such as attaching a guitar neck to a banjo body—to achieve a louder, more resonant sound suited to the demands of early jazz ensembles[1][4]. His playing combined rhythmic drive with melodic inventiveness, and he was known for his hard, clean single-string lines and smooth rhythm guitar work, using picks he crafted himself from toothbrush handles[1]. St. Cyr’s contributions are immortalized on landmark recordings like Louis Armstrong’s Hot Five and Hot Seven sessions (1925–1928), where his banjo provided both harmonic foundation and rhythmic propulsion[1][2]. Later in life, he led bands at Disneyland, most notably the Young Men from New Orleans, and remained active in music until his death in Los Angeles on June 17, 1966[1][3][5]. His legacy endures as a key architect of the jazz banjo and guitar tradition, influencing countless musicians who followed.
