## Biography
Violent Femmes are an American folk punk band formed in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in 1981 by Gordon Gano (vocals, guitar), Brian Ritchie (bass), and Victor DeLorenzo (percussion). The trio began their career busking on the streets and playing coffee houses, blending acoustic instrumentation with punk energy and raw, confessional lyrics. Their breakthrough came when they were discovered by James Honeyman-Scott of The Pretenders while performing outside a Milwaukee venue, leading to an invitation to open for the band and a subsequent surge in attention.

Their self-titled debut album, released in 1983, was largely written while Gano was still in high school and featured enduring tracks like "Blister in the Sun," "Add It Up," and "Gone Daddy Gone." Though initially slow to chart, the album eventually achieved platinum status and became a touchstone for the emerging alternative and folk punk scenes. The band's sound evolved over subsequent albums, incorporating country and pop elements, but always retained their signature blend of acoustic punk and lyrical honesty. Despite lineup changes and a brief split in the late 1980s, Violent Femmes continued to record and tour, influencing a wide range of artists and maintaining a dedicated global following.

Violent Femmes' legacy lies in their pioneering role in folk punk and alternative rock, inspiring generations of musicians with their stripped-down sound, unfiltered storytelling, and willingness to blend genres. Their music remains a staple of college radio, festivals, and film soundtracks, and they are credited with helping to shape the sound of indie rock, grunge, and emo in the decades that followed.
