## Biography
Don Vappie is a New Orleans–born Creole banjoist, guitarist, bassist, vocalist, composer, and educator, widely regarded as one of the foremost contemporary exponents of traditional Creole jazz. Raised uptown in a deeply musical Creole family whose roots in the region predate the Louisiana Purchase, he grew up immersed in brass bands, parade music, and the sounds of New Orleans clubs.[1][4] He began formal music study on piano around age six and soon moved to trumpet and brass instruments in school bands, before turning to electric bass and guitar as a teenager to play funk, disco, and modern jazz in neighborhood and garage bands.[1][3][4] By his mid-teens he was already working professionally on Bourbon Street, and at 17 he was playing proms and social events with the band TracOne while attending college, building a solid foundation in both popular and jazz idioms.[3][4]

In his early career Vappie performed bass and guitar in hotel big bands and modern jazz groups, but a decisive turn came when veteran New Orleans drummer Cie Frazier encouraged him to "get back to basics," prompting him to take up the tenor banjo and delve into the instrument’s central role in early New Orleans jazz.[1] Work on the riverboat Natchez and then a featured role with the Preservation Hall Jazz Band cemented his reputation as a leading traditional player, and he eventually formed and led his own ensemble, the Creole Jazz Serenaders, dedicated to classic New Orleans and Creole repertoire.[1][2][4] Over the decades he has recorded as a leader on projects such as "Banjo à la Creole" and later "The Blue Book of Storyville," the latter made with his transatlantic project Jazz Créole and named Jazz CD of the Year by The Times of London for its inventive reimagining of Storyville-era material.[1][4] His musical style blends authentic early-jazz banjo technique, swing-era phrasing, Caribbean and Louisiana Creole rhythms, and a relaxed, story-driven vocal approach, all underpinned by a strong sense of historical scholarship about Creole culture and the banjo’s African American origins.[1][4]

Beyond performance, Vappie has become an influential cultural advocate and educator. He has taught guitar at Loyola University in New Orleans and contributed to educational programs at institutions including Jazz at Lincoln Center, Carnegie Hall, and the Smithsonian, sharing both technical knowledge and historical context for New Orleans and Creole music.[1] After Hurricane Katrina he co-founded the "Bring It On Home" initiative with his wife Milly to create paid work for displaced New Orleans musicians and help them return to the city.[2][4] In recognition of his role as a cultural standard-bearer, he received the prestigious Steve Martin Banjo Prize in 2021 and was slated for induction into the American Banjo Museum Hall of Fame in 2022, affirming his legacy as a major modern voice of Creole jazz and a key figure in restoring pride in the banjo as an African American instrument.[5][7][1]

## Fun Facts
- Vappie comes from a Creole family whose surname was originally "Vapaille," and his ancestors were living in New Orleans before the 1803 Louisiana Purchase, tying him directly to the city’s early Creole-jazz lineage.[1]
- He started out on piano at six, moved to trumpet and baritone horn in school bands, then taught himself bass and guitar to play funk and disco in high-school garage bands and even worked Bourbon Street gigs as a teenager with a fake ID.[1][3][4]
- In 2008 he participated in the project "Recapturing Banjo," which aimed to restore the banjo’s status as an African American instrument and challenge stereotypes about its cultural ownership—a theme that runs through his broader career.[1]
- "The Blue Book of Storyville" (2020), created with his Jazz Créole project, reinterprets the notorious directory of sex workers from New Orleans’ red-light district by giving musical dignity and narrative depth to the lives behind those names; the album was named Jazz CD of the Year by The Times of London.[4][1]
