## Biography
Parenti's Liberty Syncopators was a pioneering jazz ensemble formed and led by clarinetist Tony Parenti (Anthony Parenti, 1900-1972) in New Orleans during the early 1920s. Born into a musical family on August 6, 1900, Parenti learned to play various reed instruments as a youngster and quickly established himself in the New Orleans jazz scene. By the time he formed the Liberty Syncopators, he had already gained experience with Johnny De Droit's Jazz Orchestra, which was notable for being the first to play jazz at elite New Orleans social functions.

The Liberty Syncopators achieved a significant milestone in 1925 when they opened as a pit theater orchestra, reportedly the only such jazz orchestra performing in theater pits in the country at that time. This groundbreaking engagement demonstrated the growing acceptance of jazz in formal entertainment venues. Parenti's clarinet style was distinctive for its fluent, legitimate tone that set him apart from many of his contemporaries, drawing comparisons to Creole clarinettists like Barney Bigard, Omer Simeon, and Albert Nicholas. While his delicate lines were sometimes lost in the indifferent recording quality of early ensemble recordings, his later work revealed him as a brilliant, tasteful soloist.

By 1924, Parenti was leading his own band at La Vida, a restaurant in New Orleans, and with this unit he made his first recordings. The Liberty Syncopators period represented the peak of his early career before he moved to New York in the early 1930s, where he became one of Irving Mills' cornermen and recorded with The Dorsey Brothers Orchestra. Throughout the 1940s, he continued performing with notable musicians including Ted Lewis, Muggsy Spanier, and Preacher Rollo and his Five Saints on MGM, leaving a lasting legacy in early jazz and ragtime performance.
