## Biography
Los Güiros is a psychedelic cumbia band originating from New Orleans, Louisiana, formed in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. The group is led by frontwoman Corina Hernandez, whose multicultural upbringing exposed her to a wide variety of musical traditions, particularly the folkloric rhythms of Central and South America. Hernandez's passion for cumbia—a genre she describes as more of a rhythm than a style—serves as the foundation for the band's sound, which merges traditional Colombian dance beats with the psychedelic guitar and organ textures of Peruvian chicha, all infused with modern electronic elements. 

The band’s formation began with a performance for Galaxie Tacos’ anniversary, quickly evolving into regular gigs and festival appearances as their energetic shows gained local acclaim. Los Güiros is distinguished by its unconventional lineup: Shaye Cohn on accordion and synth, Greg Northwood on electric guitar, Todd Burdick (of Tuba Skinny) on sousaphone, Miguel Cruz on congas, Gabriel Cruz on timbales, and Howe Pearson on electronic drums. Their interplay on stage is marked by improvisational flair and a playful spirit, creating a vibrant, dance-inducing atmosphere that has resonated with diverse audiences in New Orleans and beyond. 

Since their inception, Los Güiros has become one of the city’s busiest Latin groups, performing at major festivals such as Bonnaroo Music & Arts Festival—where they were the only Latin act invited—and releasing original music including their debut EP 'Alma de Cumbia' in 2024. Their legacy is rooted in honoring Latin American musical traditions while pushing boundaries with innovative arrangements and electronic experimentation, making them a key force in the contemporary electrocumbia scene.
