## Biography
Doug Carn (born July 14, 1948) is an American jazz musician from St. Augustine, Florida, who emerged as a visionary organist and pianist in the late 1960s.[6] Before achieving widespread recognition, Carn was already gigging in Atlanta with the Doug Carn Trio by the mid-1960s, releasing a self-titled album through Savoy in 1969.[1] His trajectory shifted dramatically after meeting Jean Perkins (born March 15, 1947), a gifted vocalist from Columbus, Georgia, whom he married and brought into his musical vision.[4] The couple relocated to Los Angeles in 1969, where they navigated the vibrant South Central jazz scene and eventually connected with emerging talents like Earth, Wind & Fire, with whom Carn recorded on their first two albums in 1971.[1] This same year marked the inception of Black Jazz Records, an Oakland-based label founded by pianist Gene Russell as an alternative to traditional jazz, and Doug and Jean Carn became its most successful act, releasing four albums between 1971-1975 that stand as spiritual jazz classics.[2][3]

During their collaborative period on Black Jazz Records, Doug and Jean Carn created some of the era's most spectacular vocal and instrumental performances, with Jean's five-octave vocal range complementing Doug's luminous work on acoustic and electric piano, Rhodes, and Moogs.[1][3] Their albums, including *Infant Eyes* (1971), *Spirit of the New Land*, *Revelation*, and *Adam's Apple* (1974), featured reworkings of jazz standards and original compositions infused with deep spiritual and Afrocentric consciousness.[1][3] The couple's partnership dissolved in the mid-1970s as Jean pursued a solo career in R&B and disco, signing to Philadelphia International Records where she achieved commercial success with singles like "Free Love" (1976).[4] Doug, meanwhile, continued his spiritual-jazz journey, eventually releasing *Al Rahman! Cry of the Floridian Tropic Son* under the name Abdul Rahim Ibrahim, reflecting his embrace of Islam.[1] In recent decades, Doug and Jean's musical orbits have intersected anew, with the former couple reuniting for performances, including a landmark 50th-anniversary celebration of Black Jazz Records in 2019 in Paris and Berlin.[2][3]

## Fun Facts
- Doug Carn was one of the last people to see Janis Joplin alive; he encountered her while living in a Hollywood apartment that also housed other jazz luminaries like Joe Zawinul and Larry Young, as well as Nat and Cannonball Adderley.[1]
- Carn famously strong-armed his way into a steady gig at a tiki-themed lounge near Western Avenue and Vernon in Los Angeles by dressing in his best clothes, taking his last five dollars, buying a double Courvoisier at the bar, and walking up to the organ player on stage to negotiate the position.[1]
- The album *Infant Eyes* (1971) was named to celebrate the birth of Doug and Jean Carn's son, and it became Black Jazz Records' biggest commercial success despite the label's short existence.[1][4]
- After his divorce from Jean in the mid-1970s, Doug Carn embraced Islam and released an album under the name Abdul Rahim Ibrahim, reflecting his spiritual transformation and commitment to his faith.[1]
