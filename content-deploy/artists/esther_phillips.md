## Biography
Esther Phillips, born Esther Mae Jones on December 23, 1935, in Galveston, Texas, emerged as a prodigious talent in American music, celebrated for her versatility across R&B, jazz, blues, soul, and even country. Raised in both Houston and Los Angeles after her parents' divorce, she began singing in church before her sister entered her into a talent contest at age 13 at Johnny Otis's Barrelhouse Club in Watts. Winning the contest launched her professional career as 'Little Esther,' and Otis quickly brought her into his revue and recording sessions, resulting in a string of R&B chart-toppers in 1950, including 'Double Crossing Blues,' 'Mistrusting Blues,' and 'Cupid's Boogie.'[1][2][4]

Despite her early success, Phillips's career was marked by personal struggles, particularly with heroin addiction, which led to periods of rehabilitation and impacted her ability to capitalize fully on her talent. Nevertheless, she continued to reinvent herself musically, recording country hits like 'Release Me' in the early 1960s, jazz-inflected albums for Atlantic, and later, acclaimed soul and jazz records for the Kudu label in the 1970s. Her emotionally charged performances, such as her rendition of 'Home Is Where the Hatred Is,' and her Grammy-nominated album 'From a Whisper to a Scream,' cemented her reputation as a deeply expressive and innovative vocalist. She remained active until her death on August 7, 1984, in Carson, California, leaving a legacy as one of the most distinctive and resilient voices in American music.[2][3][6]

## Fun Facts
- Esther Phillips took her stage surname from a Phillips 66 gas station sign after her legal surname, Jones, and her birth surname, Washington, proved confusing in the industry.[1][2]
- She was one of the few artists to chart R&B hits in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, demonstrating remarkable longevity and adaptability.[2][3]
- Her 1972 Grammy-nominated album 'From a Whisper to a Scream' featured a powerful cover of Gil Scott-Heron's 'Home Is Where the Hatred Is,' reflecting her own struggles with addiction.[2]
- Aretha Franklin, upon winning the Grammy that Phillips was also nominated for, gave Phillips her own Grammy trophy out of respect and encouragement.[2]
