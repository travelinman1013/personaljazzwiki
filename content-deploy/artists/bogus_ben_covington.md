## Biography
"Bogus" Ben Covington, born Benjamin Curry, was an American country blues musician active in the early 20th century.[1] He earned his distinctive nickname from a deceptive practice on the minstrel circuit—he pretended to be blind to enhance his performance appeal and marketability.[2][5] Little is definitively known about his early life, though he is said to have been born in Alabama, with some sources citing 1890 as a possible birth year.[1][6] Covington was a versatile multi-instrumentalist who performed vocals, harmonica (harp), banjo, and mandolin-banjo, demonstrating the instrumental diversity common among blues musicians of his era.[1][3]

Covington's career centered primarily in the American South, with documented work in Mississippi and Chicago.[6] He was a member of the Birmingham Jug Band, connecting him to the broader jug band tradition that flourished in the early blues era.[3] His recording legacy, though limited, includes compositions such as "Adam and Eve in the Garden," which survives in early blues archives.[5] Covington's active period appears to have extended into the 1930s, though precise details about his later life and death remain unclear, with sources indicating he lived until around 1935.[1] Despite his contributions to country blues, Covington remains a relatively obscure figure in blues history, with no known photographs in existence.[2]
