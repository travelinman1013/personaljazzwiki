## Biography
Cornel West, born in Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1953, was raised primarily in Sacramento, California, where his early years were marked by activism and a deep engagement with music and social justice. The son of a teacher and a U.S. Air Force administrator, West was influenced by the civil rights movement from a young age, participating in protests and drawing inspiration from figures such as Malcolm X and the Black Panther Party. He excelled academically, graduating magna cum laude from Harvard in just three years before earning his PhD in philosophy from Princeton, becoming the first African American to do so at that institution.

West's career has been defined by his roles as a philosopher, author, professor, and activist, but he has also carved out a unique space as a recording artist. His musical journey began with a profound love for jazz, soul, and gospel, which he wove into his intellectual and artistic output. He released three spoken word albums—'Sketches of My Culture' (2001), 'Street Knowledge' (2004), and 'Never Forget: A Journey of Revelations' (2007)—that blend philosophical reflection with jazz, hip-hop, soul, and blues. These projects feature collaborations with prominent musicians and showcase West's belief in the power of music as a vehicle for social commentary and cultural connection.

West's musical style is characterized by spoken word performances layered over diverse musical backdrops, reflecting his improvisational, jazz-influenced approach to both thought and art. His albums are notable for their star-studded collaborations and their engagement with themes of race, justice, and love. West's legacy in music is not defined by commercial success but by his ability to bridge intellectual discourse and popular music, inspiring artists and audiences to consider the deeper meanings behind the rhythms and words.
