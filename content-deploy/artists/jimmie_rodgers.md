## Biography
James Charles Rodgers (September 8, 1897 – May 26, 1933) was an American singer, songwriter, and musician widely regarded as the "Father of Country Music."[1] Born in Meridian, Mississippi, the youngest of three sons, Rodgers was drawn to show business from an early age.[3] He began his career working for various railroad companies, starting as a waterboy and eventually becoming a brakeman, a position that earned him the nickname "The Singing Brakeman."[1] During his railroad years, Rodgers was influenced by gandy dancers and their impromptu blues performances, which shaped his distinctive musical style.[1] In 1924, he was diagnosed with tuberculosis, which forced him to leave railroad work by 1927 and focus entirely on his music career.[1]

Rodgers' breakthrough came during the historic Bristol sessions in August 1927, when he auditioned as a solo artist for RCA Victor talent scout Ralph Peer after his band, the Tenneva Ramblers, disbanded over a billing dispute.[1][2] Though Peer initially rejected his signature song "T for Texas," a subsequent recording session in Camden, New Jersey in November 1927 produced "Blue Yodel No. 1 (T for Texas)," which became a massive hit, selling nearly half a million copies and propelling Rodgers to national fame.[1][6] Over his brief six-year recording career, Rodgers produced over 120 songs and became the first nationally known star of country music.[1][2] His innovative approach featured diverse backup arrangements, ranging from Hawaiian combos to jazz bands featuring Louis Armstrong.[2] By 1929, he had achieved full stardom, appearing in films and performing Depression-era benefits, but his health continued to decline under the stress of success.[2] Rodgers died of tuberculosis on May 26, 1933, at age 35, leaving behind a profound legacy that influenced artists across multiple genres.[1]

Rodgers' distinctive **yodeling style** and his ability to blend country, blues, and folk influences earned him the title "America's Blue Yodeler."[1] His pioneering work established many conventions of country music and demonstrated its commercial viability, making him the first performer inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame.[3] He has been cited as an inspiration by countless artists and remains one of the most influential figures in American music history.

## Fun Facts
- On the eve of the historic Bristol recording session in August 1927, Rodgers' band the Tenneva Ramblers argued over how they would be billed on the record, leading Rodgers to declare "All right ... I'll just sing one myself" and audition as a solo artist instead.[6]
- Rodgers was initially rejected for his signature song "T for Texas" during his first Bristol audition; Ralph Peer recorded "The Soldier's Sweetheart" and "Sleep, Baby, Sleep" instead, but the song was later recorded in November 1927 and became a massive hit under the title "Blue Yodel."[2][6]
- Despite being diagnosed with tuberculosis in 1924, Rodgers refused to heed doctors' warnings about the seriousness of the disease and discharged himself from the hospital to continue performing and working on the railroad.[2]
- Rodgers' innovative recording sessions featured unusually diverse backup arrangements for country music, including a Hawaiian combo and a jazz band featuring the legendary Louis Armstrong, demonstrating his willingness to experiment across musical genres.[2]
