## Biography
Charles Kent Wilson, born January 29, 1953, in Tulsa, Oklahoma, is an American R&B singer, songwriter, and record producer best known as the lead vocalist of the Gap Band and his successful solo career. Wilson co-founded the Gap Band with his brothers Robert and Ronnie in 1967, helping to define and popularize an upbeat, infectious style of funk music that achieved widespread commercial success, particularly throughout the 1980s. The band released 15 albums and produced numerous hit singles including "Outstanding," "Yearning for Your Love," "Party Train," "Burn Rubber on Me," and "You Dropped a Bomb on Me" before disbanding in 2010.

After the Gap Band's initial success waned in the early 1990s, Wilson faced significant personal challenges, experiencing homelessness and substance abuse from 1993 to 1995. His life changed dramatically when he completed a 28-day drug rehabilitation program in Acton, California in 1995, where he met Mahin Tat, a social worker who would become his wife and provide crucial support for his recovery and career resurgence. Wilson launched his solo career in earnest with his debut album "You Turn My Life Around" (1992), followed by "Bridging the Gap" (2000), which produced his first No. 1 Billboard Urban Adult Contemporary single, "Without You." His 2005 album "Charlie, Last Name Wilson" was certified gold by the RIAA and featured production from major artists including R. Kelly, Justin Timberlake, and will.i.am.

Wilson's solo career has been marked by consistent chart success and critical acclaim. His 2009 album "Uncle Charlie" debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 and No. 1 on the Billboard R&B/Hip-Hop chart, earning two Grammy nominations. The single "You Are" from his 2010 album "Just Charlie" dominated the Billboard Urban Adult Contemporary chart for 13 weeks. Throughout his career, Wilson has been nominated for 13 Grammy Awards and 11 NAACP Image Awards (winning two), received a 2009 Soul Train Icon Award, a BMI Icon Award in 2005, and a BET Lifetime Achievement Award in 2013. In 2009 and 2020, he was named Billboard magazine's No. 1 Adult R&B Artist. Beyond music, Wilson serves as the national spokesman for the Prostate Cancer Foundation, which awards a Creativity Award in his name.
