## Biography
John Lee Hooker, born August 22, 1917, near Clarksdale, Mississippi, emerged from a deeply religious sharecropping family where secular music was discouraged. His earliest musical influence came from his stepfather, a blues guitarist, who introduced him to the rhythmic, minimalist style that would become his hallmark. Leaving home as a teenager, Hooker traveled through Memphis and Cincinnati before settling in Detroit, where he worked as a janitor and played in nightclubs, eventually catching the attention of Modern Records executives.

Hooker's breakthrough came in 1948 with the hit 'Boogie Chillen,' which topped the R&B charts and launched a prolific recording career. He became known for his hypnotic, driving guitar style and deep, resonant voice, blending Delta blues roots with urban electric blues. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, Hooker recorded for numerous labels—often under pseudonyms due to contractual disputes—and released classics like 'Crawling King Snake,' 'I'm in the Mood,' and 'Boom Boom.' The folk and blues revival of the 1960s brought Hooker to new audiences, both in the United States and abroad, as British rock bands and American artists alike cited him as a major influence.

In later decades, Hooker collaborated with a wide array of musicians, including Canned Heat, Bonnie Raitt, and Carlos Santana, and enjoyed a late-career resurgence with the Grammy-winning album 'The Healer' in 1989. Inducted into both the Blues and Rock and Roll Halls of Fame, Hooker left an indelible mark on the blues and popular music before his death in Los Altos, California, in 2001.
