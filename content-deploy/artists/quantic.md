## Biography
Will Holland, known by his stage name Quantic, was born in Bewdley, Worcestershire, England, into a musical household with two older sisters who played instruments, fostering his early interest in music. Growing up beside the River Severn, he developed a passion for record collecting and set up a makeshift bedroom studio, experimenting with various sounds. At age 16, he began his career releasing downtempo and instrumental beats on 45 records with labels like Breakin Bread Records ('We Got Soul') and later Tru Thoughts, marking his entry into production, DJing, and remixing.[1][2][5][6]

Holland moved to Brighton in the early 2000s, where he evolved his sound through funk, soul, and Afrobeat with the Quantic Soul Orchestra, releasing albums like 'Pushin On' featuring collaborators such as Alice Russell and Spanky Wilson. In 2005, he collaborated on the salsa track 'Mi Swing Es Tropical' with Nickodemus. Relocating to Cali, Colombia in 2007, he immersed himself in cumbia, salsa, and Afro-Colombian rhythms, establishing Sonido del Valle studio and forming projects like Quantic y Su Combo Bárbaro with Alfredo Linares and Nidia Gongora, and co-founding Ondatropica with Mario Galeano. Albums such as 'Tropidelico,' 'Magnetica,' and 'Atlantic Oscillations' reflect his fusion of electronic, Latin, jazz, and soul elements.[1][2][3][4][5]

Now based in New York after years in Colombia, Holland continues as a multi-instrumentalist (guitar, accordion), producer, and DJ, with over 17 studio albums across aliases like Flowering Inferno and The Western Transient. His work bridges global heritage with progressive electronic production, earning international acclaim through tours, residencies, and innovative live bands.[2][5][7]
