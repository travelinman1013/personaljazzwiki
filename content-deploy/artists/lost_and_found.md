## Biography
Lost and Found is a Christian music duo consisting of Michael Bridges and George Baum who have been performing together since their high school years.[2][3] The pair began their musical journey by riding bicycles coast to coast across the United States, performing on borrowed instruments wherever they were welcomed, embodying their philosophy of "do what you can with what you have for the glory of God."[2][3] Their unique sound defies easy categorization, blending acoustic, folk, gospel, and elements of what some have described as "acoustic thrash" or "heavy mental" music, characterized by spiritually rich lyrical content delivered through just two instruments and their voices.[2][3]

Throughout their career, Lost and Found has traveled around the world performing concerts of original music while building a community of faith-centered listeners.[2][3] Their live performances are notably interactive and spontaneous, with each show being different and driven by audience participation, creating an environment where strangers become friends and the music of faith is presented as fun and accessible.[2][3] While they transitioned away from full-time touring after 2017, the duo continues to perform 6-10 days annually, with a particular focus on performing "Luther: The Rock Opera" and hosting the Luther500 Festival every two years.[3] Their music spans multiple genres including Christian folk, worship, and Christian pop, reflecting their Connecticut-based roots and New England influences.[1][6]
