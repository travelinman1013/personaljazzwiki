## Biography
Kelly Love Jones, born and raised in New Orleans East near Lake Forest Plaza, grew up in a musical family where her mother Patricia and sister were singers, fostering her early passion for music. At 17, she attended high school in Atlanta, Georgia, living with her father Bruce, where she immersed herself in hip hop, forming her first group Understatement and embracing freestyling, rapping, singing, and playing instruments. After graduating from The Art Institute of Houston with a videography degree, she returned to New Orleans, studied sound recording, and began performing in talent shows and local venues, initially lacking vocal polish but driven by determination.[1]
