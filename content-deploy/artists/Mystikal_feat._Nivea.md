## Biography
Mystikal, born Michael Lawrence Tyler on September 22, 1970, in New Orleans, Louisiana, is a prominent American rapper and actor known for his energetic, raspy vocal delivery and Southern hip-hop style. Raised in New Orleans' 12th Ward, Mystikal's early exposure to music included opening for legendary acts like Run-D.M.C. and Doug E. Fresh, which helped launch his career in the early 1990s. After serving in the U.S. Army as a combat engineer, he signed with Big Boy Records, releasing his debut album 'Mystikal' in 1994, which became one of the label's most successful releases.

Mystikal's breakthrough came after signing with Jive Records and later joining Master P's No Limit Records, where he released commercially successful albums such as 'Unpredictable' (1997) and 'Ghetto Fabulous' (1998). His 2000 album 'Let's Get Ready' debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and featured the hit single 'Danger (Been So Long)' with Nivea, as well as 'Shake Ya Ass.' His style blends rapid-fire delivery with influences from R&B, jazz, and funk, making him a distinctive figure in Southern rap. Despite his musical achievements, Mystikal's career has been marred by legal troubles, including a prison sentence from 2004 to 2010, but he remains influential in hip-hop circles.[1][2][3]

The collaboration 'Mystikal feat. Nivea' refers specifically to the 2000 single 'Danger (Been So Long),' which became a major hit and showcased the synergy between Mystikal's aggressive flow and Nivea's smooth R&B vocals. This track remains one of the defining moments of both artists' careers, cementing Mystikal's legacy as a crossover artist capable of blending hip-hop with mainstream R&B.[3]
