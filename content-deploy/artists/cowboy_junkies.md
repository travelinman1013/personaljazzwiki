## Biography
Cowboy Junkies are a Canadian alternative country and folk rock band formed in Toronto, Ontario, in 1985 by siblings Michael Timmins (guitar, songwriting), Margo Timmins (vocals), and Peter Timmins (drums), alongside bassist Alan Anton. The group emerged from Toronto’s vibrant Queen Street West music scene, initially performing in small clubs and developing a signature sound characterized by slow tempos, hushed vocals, and a blend of blues, country, folk, rock, and jazz influences. Their debut album, 'Whites Off Earth Now!!' (1986), was recorded in their family garage using a single ambisonic microphone, a necessity that shaped their understated style.[1][2][3]

The band achieved international recognition with their second album, 'The Trinity Session' (1988), recorded live in Toronto’s Church of the Holy Trinity. The album’s sparse arrangements and haunting interpretations of both original songs and covers earned critical acclaim, with the Los Angeles Times naming it one of the ten best albums of 1988. Over the decades, Cowboy Junkies have released more than a dozen studio albums, including the ambitious 'Nomad Series' (2010–2012), and have maintained a dedicated fanbase through their introspective lyrics, atmospheric sound, and commitment to independent production, including founding their own label, Latent Recordings.[1][2][3]

Cowboy Junkies are recognized for their influence on the alt-country and Americana genres, blending traditional roots music with modern sensibilities. Their legacy includes a reputation for artistic integrity, innovative recording techniques, and a unique approach to live performance, often marked by improvisation and subtle dynamics. The band continues to tour and record, remaining a distinctive voice in North American music.[1][2][3]

## Fun Facts

- Their breakthrough album, 'The Trinity Session,' was recorded in a single day using just one microphone in a church, capturing the natural acoustics and ambiance.[1][2]
- Margo Timmins was initially reluctant to join the band and had no prior experience as a lead singer; she was persuaded by her brother Michael to try singing with the group.[1]
- The band's name, 'Cowboy Junkies,' was chosen spontaneously before their first gig, after considering several other names.[8]
