## Biography
Tim Bernardes is a Brazilian singer, songwriter, multi‑instrumentalist, arranger, and producer from São Paulo, widely regarded as one of the leading contemporary voices in modern MPB (Música Popular Brasileira). A son of musician Maurício Pereira, he grew up in a deeply musical environment and began studying music at the age of six, learning theory with Pedro Mourão and guitar with Akira, both from the influential experimental group Rumo, part of the 1980s “vanguarda paulista” scene.[3] As a teenager he immersed himself in bands and formal study, eventually earning a bachelor’s degree in Popular Music with a specialization in guitar from Faculdade Santa Marcelina under professor Fernando Corrêa, while already writing the songs that would launch his band O Terno.[3]

In the early 2010s Bernardes emerged as the frontman, principal songwriter, and arranger for São Paulo alt‑rock/tropicália‑indie group O Terno, whose home‑recorded early material first appeared on MySpace and later developed into a catalog of four acclaimed albums blending 1960s Brazilian pop, rock, and orchestral arrangements with sharp, millennial‑era lyrics.[1][2][3] Parallel to the band, he began a solo career with the intimate, orchestrated debut album "Recomeçar" (2017), which earned a Latin Grammy nomination and positioned him internationally as a singular voice connecting classic MPB songwriting with contemporary indie aesthetics.[4][8] His second solo album, "Mil Coisas Invisíveis" (2022), written largely while touring with O Terno, deepened his reputation for warm, emotionally resonant, and philosophically inclined music that weaves tropicália, samba, and indie‑folk textures into reflective songs about love, spirituality, and self‑discovery.[1][2][4][6]

Bernardes’ musical style is characterized by gentle yet firm vocals, intricate harmonies, and arrangements that nod to the Brazilian 1960s–70s canon while remaining understated and modern.[1][2][4][6] He often records and arranges most instruments himself, drawing on a broad command of studio craft honed since his teenage years and with O Terno.[1][4][6] Critics and peers highlight his ability to bridge the lineage of classic MPB and tropicália (Gal Costa, Tom Zé and their generation) with today’s global indie world, highlighted by collaborations with artists such as Fleet Foxes, David Byrne, Devendra Banhart, and Gal Costa herself.[4][6] Although still in mid‑career, Bernardes is increasingly cited as a key figure carrying forward Brazil’s singer‑songwriter tradition for a new generation, connecting domestic audiences with listeners across the Americas, Europe, and beyond through tours, festival appearances, and a steadily growing, deeply devoted fanbase.[1][4][5][8]

## Fun Facts
- Tim Bernardes was born on June 18—the same day as Paul McCartney—and, according to a biographical note, his first spoken word as a child was a mispronounced version of “música,” signaling his early bond with music.[3]
- He studied with members of the avant‑garde group Rumo, central to São Paulo’s 1980s “vanguarda paulista,” meaning his earliest formal teachers were themselves key figures in Brazil’s experimental MPB scene.[3]
- Before O Terno became known, Bernardes quietly uploaded the band’s first home‑recorded tracks to MySpace, but his shyness meant the page was scarcely publicized at the time.[3]
- On his song "Mistificar" he sings “I do believe in Beatles,” directly answering John Lennon’s line “I don’t believe in Beatles” from "God," a playful way of inserting himself into the broader history of pop music he admires.[1]
