## Biography
Isaiah J. Thompson, born on April 29, 1997, in West Orange, New Jersey, began studying piano at an early age with teachers Alla Epelbaum at the Calderone School of Music and Bob Mikula, later immersing himself in jazz through programs like Jazz House Kids, NJPAC Jazz for Teens, and Jazz at Lincoln Center.[1][2][3] He attended Montclair Kimberley Academy before gaining admission to The Juilliard School at 18, where he earned both his Bachelor's (2019) and Master's (2020) degrees in Music, and later pursued Christian Studies at Fuller Theological Seminary.[1][2][4] His career took off early, with a recording debut on the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra's Handful of Keys (2017) featuring Wynton Marsalis while still a student, followed by performances at Carnegie Hall playing Duke Ellington's sacred music as part of the Jazz at Lincoln Center Youth Orchestra.[1][2][4]

Thompson's style blends traditional jazz influences with personal expression rooted in spirituality, evident in albums like Plays the Music of Buddy Montgomery (2020), Composed in Color (2021), The Power of the Spirit (2023), A Guaraldi Holiday (2023), and The Book of Isaiah: Modern Jazz Ministry (2025).[1][2] He joined the John Pizzarelli Trio in 2019 and has collaborated with luminaries including Christian McBride, Steve Turre, Ron Carter, Joe Farnsworth, Buster Williams, and Catherine Russell, while contributing to the Golden Globe-nominated Motherless Brooklyn soundtrack (2019).[1][2][3] A Steinway Artist, Thompson overcame severe tendonitis that threatened his career, leading to a deepened Christian faith that now informs his music's themes of spirit and individuality.[2][4]

His accolades include National YoungArts jazz piano winner, Essentially Ellington and Charles Mingus competition awards, the 2016 Horace Parlan Talent Award, 2018 Lincoln Center Emerging Artist Award and second place in the Thelonious Monk Competition, and the 2023 American Pianists Awards with Cole Porter Fellowship in Jazz; in 2024, he joined Juilliard's Jazz Studies Faculty, marking his rising legacy as a pianist, composer, and educator.[1][2][5]

## Fun Facts
- As a high school student in 2014, Thompson performed Duke Ellington's sacred music at Carnegie Hall with the Jazz at Lincoln Center Youth Orchestra, a 300-piece choir, Jimmy Heath, and Lalah Hathaway, describing it as 'absolutely terrifying but rewarding.'[4]
- Severe tendonitis limited him to playing only 10-15 minutes at a time for years, prompting a career crisis that led him to deepen his Christian faith and redefine his identity beyond music.[4]
- He contributed to the Golden Globe-nominated soundtrack for the film Motherless Brooklyn (2019).[1][2]
- Thompson released The Book of Isaiah: Modern Jazz Ministry in 2025 on Mack Avenue Records, featuring South African vocalist Vuyo Sotashe on spiritually themed tracks like 'The Lord’s Prayer.'[1][4]
