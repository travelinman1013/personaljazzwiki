## Biography
Butterbeans and Susie were an American vaudeville comedy duo consisting of husband-and-wife team Jodie 'Butterbeans' Edwards (born July 19, 1893, in Marietta, Georgia; died October 28, 1967) and Susie Edwards (née Hawthorne; born December 1894 or 1899 or 1900 in Pensacola, Florida; died December 5, 1963). Jodie began performing as a child dancer on street corners and with local string bands in Marietta, while Susie appeared in southern vaudeville as early as 1911 billed as a 'coon shouter.' They met in 1916 during a show, married on stage in 1917 (reportedly for $50 when he was around 15 and she 14), and launched their act, initially joining Butler 'Stringbeans' May's vaudeville show after his death.[1][2][3][4]

Their career spanned over 50 years, peaking in the 1920s on the TOBA circuit and vaudeville stages, including with the Rabbit's Foot Company minstrel troupe. Known for risqué 'hokum' or 'dirty blues' songs, marital bickering skits, comic dances, and racy humor, popular numbers included 'I Want a Hot Dog for My Roll,' 'A Married Man's a Fool,' and Jodie's signature 'Heebie Jeebies' or 'The Itch' dance. Recommended by Sara Martin, they recorded over 70 sides for Okeh Records from 1924-1930, accompanied by luminaries like King Oliver, Louis Armstrong's Hot Five, and Clarence Williams, boosting their draw and leading to mainstream spots like New York's Columbia Theater.[1][2][3][4]

The duo performed into the early 1960s, appearing with Motown acts at Harlem's Apollo Theatre. After Susie's death in 1963, their daughter briefly continued the act with Jodie until he collapsed and died on stage in 1967, marking a dramatic end to their enduring legacy in African American vaudeville and early blues.[1][2][3][4]
