## Biography
Spree Wilson is a Nashville-born singer-songwriter, rapper, and producer whose career is defined by genre-blurring creativity and a deep connection to melody and storytelling. Raised in a musical household in Nashville, Tennessee, his earliest influences came less from the city’s country roots and more from his mother’s eclectic record collection, which included Elton John, Fleetwood Mac, Whitney Houston, and classical composers like Bach and Stravinsky. As a child, he was forced into the school band, where he began playing saxophone, and later discovered The Beatles, which profoundly reshaped his understanding of music. By high school, after receiving his first guitar from his grandmother, he began writing his own songs and realized music was what he wanted to do for a living.

Wilson’s career developed through a series of high-profile collaborations and songwriting credits that span pop, hip-hop, rock, and soul. He co-wrote Afrojack’s global hit “The Spark” and contributed to Kanye West’s *Cruel Summer* album, working alongside legends like Q-Tip and Dallas Austin. He has also collaborated with top producers such as No I.D. and Malay, the latter of whom he met just before the release of Frank Ocean’s *Channel Orange*. His music has been featured in major films, TV series, and global ad campaigns. As of late 2025, Wilson is preparing to release his highly anticipated EP *These Days Don’t Last Long*, a deeply personal project inspired by the loss of his grandmother, exploring themes of pain, joy, and the fleeting nature of life.

## Fun Facts
- As a 7-year-old, Spree Wilson performed a rap song written by his mother and his best friend’s aunt in front of 500 people at a church convention, dressed like a mini-Temptations with white turtlenecks, black slacks, and patent leather shoes, rapping over the MC Hammer ‘Pray’ instrumental.
- He describes his musical style as if ‘Andre 3000 and Janelle Monáe had a baby, and Cee-Lo was the uncle of that baby and Pharrell was the Godfather.’
- Wilson is a self-proclaimed nerd whose life was changed by the De La Soul album *3 Feet High and Rising*, which deeply influenced his approach to rap and wordplay.
- His upcoming EP *These Days Don’t Last Long* is inspired by the loss of his grandmother, who gave him his first guitar and helped spark his songwriting journey.
