## Biography
The New Century Ragtime Orchestra (NCRO) is a British ensemble founded in 1998 by arranger and bandleader Dave Kerr. Originating as an eight-piece band, the NCRO was established with the goal of authentically reviving and performing ragtime and early jazz music, genres that flourished in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Over time, the group expanded to eleven musicians, broadening its repertoire to include not only classic ragtime compositions but also early jazz and hot dance numbers, reflecting the vibrant musical landscape of the era.

The NCRO is distinguished by its commitment to period authenticity, both in musical arrangements and performance style. The orchestra features a rotating cast of skilled musicians, with notable members such as vocalist Caroline Irwin, whose performances evoke the charm of 1920s singers like Annette Hanshaw, and reed player Steve Andrews, known for his engaging commentary and virtuoso playing. The ensemble's dedication to historical accuracy has made it a fixture at jazz and ragtime festivals, where it is celebrated for bringing the lively spirit of ragtime to contemporary audiences.

Through its performances and recordings, the New Century Ragtime Orchestra has played a significant role in preserving and promoting ragtime music in the UK and beyond. Their work not only entertains but also educates listeners about the roots of American popular music, ensuring that the legacy of ragtime endures for new generations.
