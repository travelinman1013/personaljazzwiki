## Biography
Tri Tip Trio is a Bay Area–based **zydeco and swamp blues** band that emerged in the late 2010s, built around veteran musicians steeped in Louisiana and New Orleans dance music traditions.[4] Although described as “little more than a year old” by the time of their appearance at the Cotati Accordion Festival, the group was not a novice project but rather a fresh configuration of players already well known on the West Coast zydeco circuit, particularly through their work with the long‑running band Zydeco Flames.[1][4] Drawing on the migration of Creole and Cajun sounds into California shipyard communities during and after World War II, Tri Tip Trio helped carry forward a regional zydeco scene that had taken strong root in Northern California dance halls and clubs.[2][4]

Musically, Tri Tip Trio focuses on the **dance‑driven blend of accordion‑led zydeco, swamp blues, and New Orleans R&B** commonly heard in Louisiana roadhouses, emphasizing driving rhythms, rubboard grooves, and sing‑along hooks that translate well to Bay Area venues and festivals.[2][4][6] Their live performances, including festival sets and club shows such as Mardi Gras/Fat Tuesday celebrations, highlight a repertoire that mixes traditional zydeco feels with original material like “Oaktown Boogie,” reflecting both their Louisiana stylistic roots and their Oakland/San Francisco Bay Area home base.[5][6] Within the local scene, Tri Tip Trio has become part of the continuum of bands—alongside acts such as Zydeco Flames and Gator Nation—that keep zydeco a living, dancing tradition in Northern California rather than a purely heritage style.[1][2][4]

While still a relatively recent ensemble compared with older California zydeco institutions, Tri Tip Trio’s members bring decades of collective experience to the project, ensuring a high level of musicianship and stylistic authenticity that has helped the band secure festival slots and club bookings alongside some of the region’s most established Cajun and zydeco acts.[1][2][4][5] Their work illustrates how zydeco has adapted to new geographies—wine country dance halls, Bay Area music clubs, and community festivals—while retaining the genre’s core focus on communal dancing, call‑and‑response energy, and the distinctive timbre of accordion and washboard in full swing.[2][4][6]
