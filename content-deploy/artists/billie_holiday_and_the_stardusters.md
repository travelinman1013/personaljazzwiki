## Biography
The Stardusters were an American vocal group formed in the early 1930s in Springfield, Illinois, initially as a high school trio consisting of Curt Purnell, Glen Galyon, and Dick Wylder, who had known each other since childhood. They began performing at local events like church parties and expanded their career by moving east in 1935 to work summer seasons in Massachusetts and later join Herbert Marsh's orchestra in Boston. By 1937, they relocated to New York, adding a female singer to become a quartet, with Mary McKim (Purnell's wife) joining in 1939, and began appearing on network radio programs[1][3].

In September 1941, the Stardusters signed a five-year contract with Charlie Spivak's orchestra, where June Hutton replaced McKim as female vocalist, becoming a key part of the band's sound and popular among college audiences. Internal changes occurred, including Galyon's departure in 1943 and replacement by Bob Lenn, but tensions led to their dismissal later that year. Post-Spivak, they pursued radio, film, and recording work on the West Coast, backing artists like Phil Brito and recording under their own name. In 1948, they signed with Decca, providing backing vocals for Evelyn Knight's hits 'A Little Bird Told Me' and 'Powder Your Face With Sunshine,' as well as Billie Holiday on tracks like 'Weep No More,' and achieved a top ten hit with 'I Don’t See Me In Your Eyes Anymore' in 1949[1][6].

Known for their close-harmony vocal jazz style, the Stardusters were active through the 1940s and 1950s, supporting artists like Perry Como and appearing in polls like Down Beat's vocal combo category. Their legacy lies in their contributions to big band and vocal group recordings during the swing era, blending tight harmonies with jazz orchestration[1][5].
