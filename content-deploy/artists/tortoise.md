## Biography
Tortoise is an American post-rock band formed in Chicago, Illinois in 1990, originally conceived as a bass and drums duo by Doug McCombs and John Herndon.[1][2] The group expanded to include John McEntire, Dan Bitney, and Bundy K. Brown, creating a distinctive double rhythm section setup that was intentionally conceived as an outlier in the grunge and indie rock landscape of the 1990s.[1][2] What began as casual jam sessions at the inexpensive Idful Music studio in Chicago evolved into something revolutionary. Originally planning to call themselves Mosquito (chosen because the name contradicted their thick, heavy sound with two bass players and two drummers), the band changed their name to Tortoise when they discovered another band already using the name.[1] Their self-titled debut album, released in 1994 on Thrill Jockey Records, crystallized the subgenre that would become known as post-rock, blending elements of dub, jazz, modern classical, Afropop, house music, and experimental rock into a singular aesthetic.[1]

Tortoise's early releases, particularly their 1994 self-titled debut and 1996's Millions Now Living Will Never Die, established them as emblematic figures in Chicago's music scene and profoundly influenced contemporary independent rock.[2][4] The band's methodology centers on pushing away from the familiar and easy, incorporating distinctive instrumentation including marimba and vibraphone that became signatures of their sound.[2] As an instrumental quintet, they remain undefined and experimental, drawing from punk, jazz, minimalism, ambient, kosmische, dub, and electronica.[2] Over their 30+ year career spanning from 1990 to the present, Tortoise has remained active with current members including Jeff Parker (who replaced David Pajo), maintaining their reputation as one of the most deeply-influential and tonally-distinct music groups of the past four decades.[4]

The band's impact extends far beyond their own recordings. Members of Tortoise have been involved with numerous related projects and collaborations throughout Chicago's underground music scene, contributing to a rich ecosystem of experimental and instrumental music.[4] Their work has influenced generations of post-rock and experimental musicians, establishing Tortoise as pioneers who helped define an entire genre and approach to instrumental rock music that continues to resonate today.

## Fun Facts
- The band was originally going to be called 'Mosquito,' chosen specifically because the name contradicted their sound—they thought calling a band with two bass players and two drummers 'Mosquito' (a small, thin insect) was clever. They changed the name only on the day of their first gig when they discovered another band already using the name Mosquito.[1]
- Tortoise's self-titled debut album was recorded in off-hours and afternoons at Idful Music studio in Chicago, often when the space had no other bookings. The band would start by recording seven-inch singles, not initially planning a full album.[1]
- When creating their first album, the band's approach was highly experimental and improvisational: 'When we made the first Tortoise record, anything beyond the bass and drums was us spitballing in the studio,' according to Doug McCombs, referencing how one drummer had just acquired a vibraphone and another had interest in analog synthesizers.[3]
- Doug McCombs had originally wanted to call the band 'The Terrapin Rhythm Section,' but the democratic decision-making process of the early band led to shortening it to simply 'Tortoise.'[1]
