## Biography
Gabriels are a British-American three-piece band formed in Los Angeles in 2016, consisting of vocalist Jacob Lusk, multi-instrumentalist and director Ryan Hope, and multi-instrumentalist Ari Balouzian.[1][3] The group's origin story is unconventional: Hope and Balouzian were collaborating on film and commercial music when they discovered Lusk's vocal work and invited him to create music together at Hope's home studio in Palm Desert.[1][2] What began as a creative friendship and passion project quickly evolved into something extraordinary. Lusk, who had previously appeared on American Idol's tenth season and worked as a session vocalist and choir director, found in Gabriels a musical outlet free from industry pressure that allowed him to explore diverse influences beyond the R&B/soul constraints of his earlier career.[2][3]

Gabriels burst onto the music scene in 2020 with their debut EP, Love and Hate in a Different Time, which immediately garnered critical acclaim and attracted prominent admirers including Paul Weller, Harry Styles, and Elton John, who called the EP "one of the most seminal records I've heard in the past 10 years."[1][3] The trio's distinctive sound blends retro-futuristic soul with modern hip-hop production techniques, drawing inspiration from classic soul and gospel traditions while employing contemporary production methods.[1] Their music is characterized by dynamic strings, infectious rhythms, and Lusk's emotionally resonant vocals.[2] Following their successful debut EP and a second EP titled Blame released in November 2021, Gabriels signed with major labels Elektra (U.S.) and Parlophone (U.K.) in August 2021.[3] The band released the first part of their debut album Angels & Queens in 2022, with the second part following in July 2023, establishing themselves as a significant force in contemporary soul music.[3]

Gabriels have achieved notable milestones including performances at Glastonbury Festival in June 2022 and touring with artist Celeste in spring 2022.[3] The band was nominated for BBC Radio 1's Sound of... for 2023, cementing their status as emerging artists of significance.[3] Their creative process emphasizes organic collaboration and honest self-discovery rather than industry-driven construction, with the group's diverse musical backgrounds converging to create their distinctive retro-soul aesthetic.[2]

## Fun Facts
- The band's name Gabriels originated from the street where Ryan Hope grew up in Sunderland, United Kingdom.[2]
- Jacob Lusk appeared on American Idol season ten in 2011, where he performed covers of Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell's 'You're All I Need to Get By' and Luther Vandross's 'Dance With My Father,' reaching the top five.[2][3]
- Ryan Hope and Ari Balouzian first met Lusk through a commercial shoot and were so determined to work with him that when he initially declined an invitation to Hope's studio in Palm Springs, they camped outside his church with a remote recording studio.[3]
- The song 'Loyalty,' which became a defining moment for the band's sound, was written in just 10-15 minutes and originated from a 60-second music clip created for a Prada commercial directed by Ryan Hope and starring Oscar-winning actor J.K. Simmons.[2]
