## Biography
Ben LaMar Gay is a Chicago-born composer, cornetist, multi-instrumentalist, singer, and poet raised on the South Side of Chicago, where he was immersed in the city's legendary AACM (Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians) tradition.[1][2] Beginning his musical journey with the cornet, Gay developed an intuitive approach to self-production and traversed the diversity of Chicago's music scenes—spanning jazz, hip-hop, house, electronic, rock, avant-garde, salsa, and Latin jazz—before embarking on a several-year residential relocation to Brazil in the late 2000s.[1][5] This period abroad proved formative, allowing Gay to absorb and poetically refract the sounds of diverse musical contexts he encountered, eventually leading to the development of his signature "Pan-Americana" aesthetic that transcends traditional genre boundaries.[1]

Gay's professional emergence came in 2018 with the release of his debut album *Downtown Castles Can Never Block the Sun* via International Anthem Records, which compiled his "greatest hits" from seven years of unreleased material.[1] Since then, he has established himself as a prolific and innovative force in contemporary creative music, releasing critically acclaimed albums including *Open Arms to Open Us* (2021, International Anthem/Nonesuch Records) and *Certain Reveries* (2022, International Anthem).[1][4] Beyond recording, Gay has composed original scores, including work for the Brazilian underground carnival profile *This Is Bate Bola* (2019) and a commissioned piece performed by the Wet Ink Ensemble at the Time:Spans Festival (2021).[1] His compositional voice interweaves jazz, blues, ballads, R&B, raga, new music, nursery rhyme, Tropicália, two-step, hip-hop, and beyond, creating what NPR describes as music where "there is no one universe for Ben LaMar Gay, he just sonic booms from one sound to another."[4]

Gay's artistic practice extends beyond music into multimedia and archival work. In 2022, he wrote, staged, directed, filmed, and scored the film "Balogun," a tribute to the late Eddie Harris.[1] As an inaugural Rebuild Foundation Mellon Archival Innovation Program fellow, he has engaged in deep archival research at the Stony Island Arts Bank.[3] Collaborators and fellow musicians consistently praise his singular vision and creative generosity—Jeff Parker has called him "hands down, one of my favorite musicians on the planet today."[1] Gay's work is characterized by its integration of storytelling, folklore, and political consciousness, positioning him as a "postmodern folklorist" who enriches the history of Afro-American music while opening new artistic horizons.[2][4]

## Fun Facts
- In 2019, Ben LaMar Gay composed and performed a duet with the DuSable Bridge while it was being raised over the Chicago River—a unique multimedia performance merging architecture, music, and public space.[1]
- Before establishing himself under his own name in 2018, Gay spent seven years working under-the-radar, diligently composing, producing, and recording seven complete collections of original music before compiling them as his debut album.[1]
- Gay's artistic practice extends beyond sound: he wrote, staged, directed, filmed, and scored the entire film "Balogun" (2022) as a tribute to jazz legend Eddie Harris, demonstrating his multidisciplinary creative vision.[1]
- After years of collaboration between Chicago and Brazil, Gay's musical language is deeply influenced by Afro-Brazilian rhythms, electronic sounds, and his immersion in Brazilian culture, which he incorporates into his signature "Pan-Americana" aesthetic.[5]
