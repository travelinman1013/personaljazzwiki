## Biography
Johnny Jenkins was born on March 5, 1939, in Macon, Georgia, and grew up in the rural community of Swift Creek. From a young age, Jenkins was captivated by the sounds of blues, R&B, and hillbilly music he heard on a battery-powered radio. He built his first guitar out of a cigar box and rubber bands at age nine and soon became known locally for his left-handed, upside-down playing style, which would later become a signature of his flamboyant performances. By the late 1950s, Jenkins was leading the Pinetoppers, a band that would play a pivotal role in the early career of Otis Redding.

Jenkins's career took a significant turn in the early 1960s when he and the Pinetoppers, with Redding as their singer and Jenkins as lead guitarist, recorded at Stax Studios. Jenkins's unused studio time allowed Redding to record 'These Arms of Mine,' with Jenkins on guitar, launching Redding's career. Jenkins himself released the instrumental single 'Spunky' in 1964 and continued performing regionally, but his own recording career stalled as his manager Phil Walden shifted focus to Redding. Jenkins's 1970 album 'Ton-Ton Macoute!' featured members of the Allman Brothers Band, including Duane Allman, and its opening track, a cover of Dr. John's 'I Walk on Guilded Splinters,' was later widely sampled. Disillusioned with the music business, Jenkins withdrew from recording for decades, returning in the 1990s with the album 'Blessed Blues' and two subsequent releases.

Jenkins's guitar style, blending blues, R&B, and rock, left a lasting influence on artists such as Jimi Hendrix. Despite never achieving major commercial success, Jenkins's legacy is cemented through his work with Otis Redding, his innovative guitar technique, and his influence on Southern blues and rock musicians. He died in Macon, Georgia, in 2006 and was posthumously inducted into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame in 2012.
