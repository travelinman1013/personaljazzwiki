## Biography
Earl Hooker, born January 15, 1929, in Clarksdale, Mississippi, was a pioneering electric blues guitarist renowned for his slide guitar technique and melodic instrumental work. The nephew of John Lee Hooker, he began performing young, touring with Robert Lockwood Jr. and Sonny Boy Williamson in the late 1940s. By 1949, he relocated to Memphis, immersing himself in the Beale Street scene alongside B.B. King, Johnny Ace, and Bobby Bland, debuting with recordings like 'Race Track' on King Records and 'The Hucklebuck' for Sun.[1]

Hooker's career peaked in Chicago from the mid-1950s, where he became a prolific session guitarist for labels like Chief, Mel-Lon, and Age, contributing to over 40 sessions with artists including Junior Wells ('Messin' with the Kid'), Magic Sam, A.C. Reed, and 'Big Moose' Walker. His instrumental style blended smooth, vocal-like slide lines in minor pentatonic and blues scales, diverging from traditional bottleneck norms, as heard in signature tracks like 'Blue Guitar,' 'Calling All Blues,' and 'Blues in D Natural.' Plagued by tuberculosis, he rarely sang after 1953, focusing on guitar prowess while touring extensively.[1][2]

In 1962, Chess Records' Leonard Chess overdubbed Muddy Waters' vocals (lyrics by Willie Dixon) onto Hooker's 'Blue Guitar,' creating the hit 'You Shook Me,' which outperformed some of Waters' prior releases and was later covered by Led Zeppelin. Hooker continued recording into the late 1960s for Cuca and Bluesway, collaborating on albums like *Sweet Black Angel* and *Don't Have to Worry*, before succumbing to tuberculosis on April 21, 1970, at age 41, leaving a profound legacy in blues guitar innovation.[1][2]

## Fun Facts
- Leonard Chess overdubbed Muddy Waters' vocals directly onto Earl Hooker's existing 'Blue Guitar' instrumental without Hooker's further involvement, and Hooker likely received no payment[2].
- Hooker's 'Blue Guitar' transformed a classic Tampa Red country-blues lick into an electric melody that influenced Muddy Waters and ultimately Led Zeppelin[1].
- Despite tuberculosis limiting his vocals after 1953, Hooker recorded over 40 albums as a sideman in just four years (1959-1963)[1].
- Hooker was John Lee Hooker's nephew and guested on his cousin's album *If You Miss ’Im… I Got ’Im*[1].
