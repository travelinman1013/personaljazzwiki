## Biography
The New Orleans Hellhounds is a pseudonymous project name for Morning 40 Federation, a rock band from the Ninth Ward of New Orleans that formed in 1998.[1] The band is known for their energetic fusion of rock, pop, and funk influences, citing King Oliver, Tom Waits, and Jon Spencer as musical inspirations.[1] Morning 40 Federation took a six-year hiatus beginning in 2008 but reunited for performances starting in 2009, including a notable reunion show at the Voodoo Experience music festival on October 31, 2009.[1] The band has maintained an active presence in the New Orleans music scene through the 2010s, performing regularly at local venues such as One Eyed Jacks and d.b.a.

The New Orleans Hellhounds name specifically emerged from the band's 2007 collaboration with legendary R&B and punk blues artist Andre Williams.[2][3] In 2008, Bloodshot Records released the album 'Can You Deal With It?' credited to Andre Williams & the New Orleans Hellhounds, which merged down-and-dirty New Orleans funk with energetic rock sensibilities.[2][3][5] This ten-piece ensemble arrangement showcased the band's ability to blend traditional New Orleans musical traditions with contemporary punk and blues influences, creating a distinctive sound that reflected the city's rich musical heritage while maintaining a modern edge.
