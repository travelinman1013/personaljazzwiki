## Biography
Geno Delafose was born on February 6, 1971, in Eunice, Louisiana, into a family deeply rooted in zydeco music tradition. His father, John Delafose, was a legendary zydeco accordionist who led the Eunice Playboys, and Geno began his musical journey at just eight years old as a rubboard player in his father's band. He continued performing with the Eunice Playboys throughout his childhood and adolescence, also appearing on several of the band's recordings. This early immersion in traditional Creole and zydeco music provided the foundation for his distinctive musical voice.

In the early 1990s, Delafose transitioned from rubboard to accordion and began performing as an opening act for his father. Following his father's death in 1994, Geno succeeded him as bandleader and launched his solo career that same year with the album 'French Rockin' Boogie' on Rounder Records. The album's title became the name of his band, French Rockin' Boogie, which he continues to lead. He released two additional albums on Rounder Records before signing with Times Square Records to release 'Everybody's Dancin'' in 2003. His 2007 album 'Le Cowboy Creole' earned him a Grammy Award nomination in the Best Zydeco or Cajun Music Album category.

Delafose's musical style represents the nouveau zydeco movement, blending traditional Creole music with strong influences from Cajun, country, and western genres. He is known for his mastery of both diatonic button accordions (for traditional French-style tunes) and piano accordions (for contemporary zydeco), and he performs in both French and English. Beyond music, Delafose embodies Creole cultural traditions through his Double D Ranch near Eunice, Louisiana, where he raises cattle and horses and hosts annual fan appreciation parties, maintaining the rural heritage and values central to his identity and artistry.

## Fun Facts
- Geno was awarded Best Zydeco Artist at the 2003 Big Easy Awards in New Orleans, recognizing his contributions to the genre during a pivotal period in zydeco's evolution.
- Unlike many zydeco musicians who focus solely on traditional styles, Delafose is unafraid to incorporate diverse musical approaches including old-fashioned waltzes, two-steps, blues, and soul numbers into his repertoire while maintaining Creole authenticity.
- Delafose epitomizes Creole cultural identity by operating Double D Ranch, where he raises cattle and horses—embodying the rural traditions and land stewardship that are central to Creole heritage, challenging stereotypical associations of cowboy culture with only Anglo-Saxon communities.
- He mastered both single-row and triple-row diatonic button accordions for traditional French-style tunes and piano accordions for contemporary zydeco, demonstrating technical sophistication that was relatively uncommon in zydeco until the 1980s.
