## Biography
Fenton Lee Robinson was born on September 23, 1935, in Greenwood, Mississippi, and grew up in nearby LeFlore County[1][3][4]. Inspired by the blues he heard on the radio—particularly the recordings of T-Bone Walker—he moved to Memphis, Tennessee, at the age of 16 to pursue music[2][3][4]. By his early twenties, Robinson had established himself on the Southern blues scene, making his recording debut in 1957 with the original song "Tennessee Woman," which became a blues standard and earned him a contract with Duke Records[1][2][3]. Over the next few years, he recorded a series of singles for Duke, including the seminal "As the Years Go Passing By" (later a hit for Albert King) and "Mississippi Steamboat"[2][3]. In 1962, Robinson relocated to Chicago, where he became a fixture in the city’s vibrant blues clubs, performing alongside legends like Junior Wells, Sonny Boy Williamson, and Otis Rush[2].

Robinson’s career reached a pivotal moment in 1967 with the recording of his signature song, "Somebody Loan Me a Dime," for the Palos label[1][2][4]. Despite initial distribution setbacks, the song became a blues classic, famously covered by Boz Scaggs in 1969, though a legal dispute arose over authorship[1][2]. Robinson re-recorded the track for his 1974 album Somebody Loan Me a Dime, the first of three acclaimed releases for Alligator Records[1][4]. His 1977 album I Hear Some Blues Downstairs earned a Grammy nomination, and Nightflight followed in 1984[1][4]. Known for his mellow, jazz-inflected guitar style and rich, sophisticated vocals, Robinson was dubbed "the mellow blues genius" by Japanese fans[2]. Though his introspective, melodic approach didn’t always resonate with mainstream audiences, he was highly respected by critics and fellow musicians. In later years, Robinson taught guitar and participated in educational programs like "Blues In The Schools" in Springfield, Illinois[3]. He passed away on November 25, 1997, in Rockford, Illinois, from complications of brain cancer[1][3].

## Fun Facts
- Robinson’s "Somebody Loan Me a Dime" was featured in the film The Blues Brothers, playing on the radio during a key scene[1].
- Japanese fans nicknamed him "the mellow blues genius" for his smooth vocals and jazz-inflected guitar work[2].
- Robinson was arrested and imprisoned for nine months in the 1970s for involuntary manslaughter related to a car accident, but resumed his music career after release[1].
- Despite his critical acclaim, Robinson never achieved widespread commercial success, but he was deeply respected by fellow musicians and blues aficionados[3].
