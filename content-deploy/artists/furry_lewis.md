## Biography
Walter 'Furry' Lewis (born March 6, 1893 or 1899, in Greenwood, Mississippi – died September 14, 1981, in Memphis, Tennessee) was a pioneering figure in early country blues. Moving to Memphis as a child, Lewis grew up immersed in the vibrant musical atmosphere of Beale Street, where he was exposed to a wide range of African American musical styles. By his teens, he was performing solo at parties, taverns, and on the streets, and he occasionally played with W.C. Handy's Orchestra, gaining valuable experience and exposure to new musical ideas.

Lewis became known for his expressive bottleneck guitar technique and his ability to infuse performances with subtlety and emotion. He traveled with medicine shows in the South, further developing his style and repertoire. Despite losing a leg in a train accident in 1917, Lewis continued to perform and, in the late 1920s, recorded over twenty sides for Vocalion and Victor, producing enduring classics such as 'Kassie Jones.' However, the Great Depression and changing musical tastes led him to step back from professional music, and he worked as a street sweeper in Memphis for decades, playing music only occasionally.

Rediscovered during the folk blues revival of the 1960s, Lewis recorded new albums, appeared on television and in film, and even opened for rock acts in the 1970s. His relaxed, intimate style and storytelling lyrics influenced generations of musicians, securing his legacy as one of the most creative and personal voices in the blues.
