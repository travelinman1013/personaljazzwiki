## Biography
Ramblin' Jack Elliott, born Elliott Charles Adnopoz on August 1, 1931, in Brooklyn, New York, ran away from home at age 14 to join the rodeo, where he learned guitar from cowboy Brahmer Rogers. After teaching himself guitar and busking, he met Woody Guthrie in 1950, moved in with the Guthrie family, and traveled with him to California and Florida, absorbing Guthrie's style so completely that Woody remarked Jack sounded more like him than he did himself[1][2][8]. In 1954, he journeyed through Appalachia, Nashville, and New Orleans with folk singers Frank Robinson and Guy Carawan, later basing his talking song '912 Greens' on the experience[1].

Elliott married in 1955 and toured Europe with banjo player Derroll Adams, recording three albums for Topic Records and inspiring British rockers like Mick Jagger and Eric Clapton with his American folk, cowboy, and blues repertoire[1][2][5]. Returning to the U.S. in 1961, he met Bob Dylan at Woody Guthrie's bedside and mentored him, while continuing to learn blues from masters like Leadbelly, Mississippi John Hurt, Reverend Gary Davis, Big Bill Broonzy, Brownie McGhee, Sonny Terry, Jesse Fuller, and Champion Jack Dupree[1][2]. A founding member of Dylan's Rolling Thunder Revue, he has released over 40 albums, blending flatpicking guitar, fingerpicking, harmonica, and laconic storytelling in traditional folk, Americana, bluegrass, and blues styles[1][2].

Elliott won Grammy Awards for Best Traditional Folk Album in 1996 ('South Coast') and 2009, received the National Medal of the Arts from President Bill Clinton in 1998, and was inducted into the Folk Americana Roots Hall of Fame in 2024 as a solo living artist[1][3]. His daughter Aiyana Elliott directed 'The Ballad of Ramblin' Jack' in 2000, which won a Special Jury Prize at Sundance. At 93, he remains a traveling troubadour preserving authentic American roots music[1][2][3].

## Fun Facts
- His stage name 'Ramblin' Jack' originated when Odetta's mother announced, 'Odetta, Ramblin’ Jack is here,' during a visit, and he adopted it immediately[3].
- Woody Guthrie said Jack 'sounds more like me than I do,' and Arlo Guthrie learned his father's style primarily from Jack due to Woody's illness[1][2].
- He wrote one of the first trucking songs, 'Cup of Coffee,' later recorded by Johnny Cash, along with '912 Greens' and 'Bleeker Street Blues' for Dylan during his hospitalization[1][3].
- Bob Dylan called him 'The King of the Folksingers,' and he was friends with Jack Kerouac and recorded by Alan Lomax[3].
