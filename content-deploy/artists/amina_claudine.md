## Biography
Amina Claudine Myers was born on March 21, 1942, in Blackwell, Arkansas, and raised primarily by her great-aunt Emma Thomas and uncle Buford. She began piano lessons at age six, formed a gospel group after moving back to Blackwell in 1957, and developed her skills directing church choirs and playing gospel and R&B during high school. Myers earned a Bachelor of Arts in music education from Philander Smith College in Little Rock, Arkansas, where she played in the jazz band, directed the choir, learned blues, and self-taught organ. Early gigs included performing at the Safari Room jazz club and summer organ work in Louisville, Kentucky.[1][2][4][5]

After graduating in 1963, Myers moved to Chicago, teaching music at an elementary school for six years while immersing herself in jazz. She joined the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians (AACM) in 1966, performing at its second concert and crediting it for shaping her compositional style blending gospel, blues, and free jazz. Influenced by AACM founders like Muhal Richard Abrams, she gigged solo piano, copying Nina Simone initially, and collaborated with Chicago jazz figures. In 1976, she relocated to New York City, intensifying her work in composition, theater (including Off-Broadway scores and her musical 'I Dream'), and touring Europe with Lester Bowie's groups. She served as choral director and assistant musical director for projects like Charlie Haden’s Liberation Music Orchestra.[1][2][3][4][5]

Myers' style fuses gospel roots, blues, avant-garde jazz, and classical elements, evident in her 12 solo albums and works for voice, organ, and ensembles like 'Improvisational Suite for Chorus, Pipe Organ and Percussion.' A 2024 NEA Jazz Master and Arkansas Black Hall of Fame inductee (2001), she has performed globally, taught workshops, and continues active at 83, with recent releases like 'Sama Rou: Songs from My Soul' (2016).[1][2][4]
