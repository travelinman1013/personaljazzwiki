## Biography
Mary Halvorson (born October 16, 1980) is an American guitarist, composer, and bandleader widely recognized as one of the most original voices in contemporary jazz and experimental music.[1][2][4] Raised in Brookline, Massachusetts, she began on violin before switching to electric guitar around age 11 after being captivated by Jimi Hendrix’s “Axis: Bold as Love,” a record owned by her father.[1][6][8] She studied with Israeli-born jazz guitarist Issi Rozen in Brookline, and after enrolling at Wesleyan University originally as a biology major, she abandoned that path when she encountered saxophonist Anthony Braxton’s music classes and joined his ensembles, an experience that redirected her life decisively toward creative music.[1][6] After graduating from Wesleyan, she continued to develop in New York’s avant‑garde and downtown jazz scenes, quickly becoming a first‑call guitarist for boundary‑pushing bandleaders.

Over the 2000s and 2010s, Halvorson emerged as a prolific leader and collaborator, known for a percussive picking attack, clear hollow‑body tone, and signature pitch‑bending effects that subtly warp lines and chords.[1][2] Her debut as a leader, “Dragon’s Head” (2008), introduced a guitar‑bass‑drums trio with John Hébert and Ches Smith and set the tone for a string of acclaimed Firehouse 12 releases that expanded to quintet, septet, and octet formats on albums such as “Saturn Sings,” “Bending Bridges,” “Illusionary Sea,” and “Away With You,” the last adding pedal‑steel player Susan Alcorn to a rich chamber‑jazz texture.[1][5] She has also explored solo guitar deconstructions of standards on “Meltframe,” lyric‑driven writing on the Code Girl project, long‑running collective work in the trio Thumbscrew with Michael Formanek and Tomas Fujiwara, and numerous collaborations across jazz, rock, and experimental music.[1][2][3][5] Based in Brooklyn, she teaches at The New School’s College of Performing Arts and records for Nonesuch Records, while accumulating major honors including repeated Guitarist of the Year wins in the DownBeat Critics Poll and a 2019 MacArthur “Genius” Fellowship, cementing her reputation as a generational innovator at the intersection of jazz, rock, and avant‑garde improvisation.[2][4][5][9]

## Fun Facts
- Halvorson originally planned to major in biology at Wesleyan University but changed direction entirely after sitting in on Anthony Braxton’s music class and being drawn into his ensembles.[1][6]
- Her decision to switch from violin to guitar at age 11 was sparked specifically by hearing her father’s copy of Jimi Hendrix’s “Axis: Bold as Love.”[6][8]
- She is known for using a vintage Guild hollow‑body guitar and subtle electronic pitch‑bending effects that cause notes and chords to ‘melt’ or detune mid‑phrase, a hallmark of her sound.[2]
- She has won the Guitarist of the Year honor in the DownBeat Critics Poll for multiple consecutive years and received a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship in 2019, recognition rarely given to jazz guitarists.[2][4][5]

(Influence is often traced to albums like “Dragon’s Head,” “Meltframe,” “Away With You,” and “Code Girl,” which are widely cited in reviews and polls.[2][3][4][5]) [2010s–present (inferred from critical reception and institutional recognition)]
