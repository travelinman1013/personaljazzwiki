# Victor Jara

## Biography
Víctor Lidio Jara Martínez was born on September 28, 1932, in Lonquén, Chile, to a peasant family. Orphaned by age 15 after losing both parents, he was taught traditional songs by his mother and later pursued studies in theater and education, becoming a teacher, theater director, and poet. In 1957, he met Violeta Parra, whose modern folk compositions inspired him to explore Chile's traditional music, performing with groups like Cuncumén and at peñas such as La Peña de Los Parra.[1][3]

Jara's career evolved in the 1960s as he pioneered the Nueva canción chilena (New Chilean Song) movement, blending folk traditions with socially conscious themes of love, peace, and justice. He released key albums like his 1966 debut Canto a lo humano, collaborations with Quilapayún such as Canciones folklóricas de América (1968), and solo works including El derecho de vivir en paz (1971). A committed Communist, he supported Salvador Allende's 1970 election, composing the campaign anthem Venceremos and organizing cultural events for the Popular Unity government while teaching at Chile's Technical University.[1][3][2]

Following the 1973 military coup led by Augusto Pinochet, Jara was arrested at the Technical University, tortured—including having his hands broken—and executed on September 16, 1973. His defiant singing of Venceremos amid torture and his murder transformed him into a global symbol of resistance against dictatorship, human rights struggles, and the Nueva canción legacy.[1][3][2][4]

## Fun Facts
- During his torture after the 1973 coup, guards smashed Jara's fingers and mockingly demanded he play guitar; he defiantly sang 'Venceremos' instead.[1][3]
- Soviet media falsely claimed Jara's powerful voice resulted from surgery performed in Moscow after a successful concert there.[1]
- Jara wrote his final poem, smuggled out by a friend, while imprisoned with broken hands and ribs in the stadium later named after him.[4]
- Described as the 'Bob Dylan of South America' for his role in nueva canción, addressing poverty and injustice.[2]
