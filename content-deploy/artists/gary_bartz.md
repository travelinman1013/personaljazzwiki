## Biography
Gary Bartz, born September 26, 1940, in Baltimore, Maryland, is a renowned American jazz saxophonist whose career has spanned more than six decades. Raised in a musically rich environment—his parents owned Baltimore’s North End Lounge, a jazz club frequented by legends—Bartz was immersed in jazz from an early age. He began playing alto saxophone at age 11 and moved to New York at 17 to study at the Juilliard School, supplementing his formal education with jam sessions and gigs at his family’s club during visits home.

Bartz’s early professional years saw him performing with jazz greats such as Charles Mingus, Max Roach, Abbey Lincoln, and Art Blakey, making his recording debut with Blakey’s Jazz Messengers in 1965. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, he joined McCoy Tyner’s group and Miles Davis’s electric band, performing at historic events like the Isle of Wight Festival and on albums such as 'Live-Evil.' Bartz soon established himself as a bandleader, forming the innovative Ntu Troop in 1969, which fused jazz, funk, and soul, and released acclaimed albums like 'Harlem Bush Music.'

Known for his dynamic, soulful sound and commitment to musical unity, Bartz has released over 40 solo albums and contributed to more than 200 recordings as a guest artist. His influence extends beyond performance, as he has mentored younger musicians and remained a vital figure in jazz, earning two Grammy Awards and being named a 2024 NEA Jazz Master. Bartz’s legacy is defined by his adventurous spirit, genre-blending compositions, and dedication to furthering the heritage of Black American music.
