## Biography
Charles Alfred Leavell was born on April 28, 1952, in Birmingham, Alabama. His passion for music ignited at age 13 after witnessing a Ray Charles performance, prompting him to pursue a career in music. By 15, he was recording in the legendary Muscle Shoals studios, contributing to tracks like Freddie North’s 'Don’t Take Her, She’s All I’ve Got.' Early session work led to tours with Alex Taylor and Dr. John, whom Leavell credits as his 'college education,' before joining Gregg Allman’s solo project *Laid Back* and the Allman Brothers Band in 1972 following Duane Allman’s death.[1][4][5]

Leavell’s tenure with the Allman Brothers Band marked their commercial peak, highlighted by the #1 album *Brothers and Sisters* featuring 'Ramblin’ Man' and 'Jessica.' After the band’s 1976 disbandment, he co-founded the jazz-rock fusion group Sea Level with Jaimoe and Lamar Williams, releasing five albums through the late 1970s. In 1982, introduced via Ian Stewart and Bill Graham, Leavell became the Rolling Stones’ principal touring keyboardist and musical director, a role Keith Richards deems essential for the band’s continuity, spanning over four decades with contributions to tours like *Tattoo You* and *A Bigger Bang*.[1][2][3][4]

Renowned for his blues-infused piano style blending rock, jazz, and Southern grooves, Leavell has recorded with Eric Clapton (*Unplugged*, *24 Nights*), George Harrison, John Mayer, and others, while releasing solo works like *What’s In That Bag?* (1999) and *Live in Germany* (2008). Beyond music, he’s an environmental advocate, tree farmer, author, and host of PBS’s *America’s Forests with Chuck Leavell*, cementing his legacy as a versatile Southern rock icon.[1][3][4][5]
