## Biography
Ophlin Russell, better known as Sister Nancy (or Muma Nancy), was born on January 2, 1962, in Kingston, Jamaica, as one of 15 siblings in a conservative household. Her elder brother, Brigadier Jerry, inspired her entry into music; despite family resistance, particularly from her father who favored Christian music, she began DJing as a teenager on soundsystems like Jahlovemuzik, Black Star, and Stereophonic alongside General Echo. Rebelling against traditional expectations, she ran away from home at times, honing her skills and becoming the first female dancehall DJ, known for her high-pitched patois vocals over crackling bass and horns in genres like reggae, ragga, and rocksteady.[1][2][4]

Her career took off in 1980 when producer Winston Riley recorded her debut single 'Papa Dean' for Techniques, followed by hits like 'Bam Bam' (1981), 'One Two,' and 'Money Can't Buy Me Love.' She released her debut album *One, Two* in 1982 on Greensleeves, performed at Reggae Sunsplash as the first female DJ, and toured internationally. Collaborating with Henry 'Junjo' Lawes and others, she solidified her status before relocating to New Jersey in 1996, where she worked as a bank accountant for 15 years while occasionally performing. Her 2007 album *Sister Nancy Meets Fireproof* marked a return.[1][2]

Sister Nancy's legacy endures as a pioneering 'dominating female voice' in dancehall for over two decades, role model to artists like Lady Saw and Macka Diamond, with 'Bam Bam' hailed as a reggae anthem sampled widely in ragga-jungle and beyond.[1][3]
