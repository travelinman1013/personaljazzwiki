## Biography
Erskine Hawkins (1914–1993) was a renowned American trumpeter, composer, and big band leader, celebrated as the 'Twentieth-Century Gabriel' for his dazzling high-note trumpet work and flamboyant solos. Born in Birmingham, Alabama, Hawkins began his musical journey as a drummer before switching to trumpet in his early teens. He attended Alabama State Teachers College, where he led the Bama State Collegians, a college band that gained a reputation as one of the finest of its era. In 1934, Hawkins and his band moved to New York, where their energetic performances at the Savoy Ballroom quickly established them as a major force in the swing scene.

By 1938, the group had evolved into the Erskine Hawkins Orchestra, signing with RCA Bluebird and later RCA Victor, and becoming the house band at the Savoy Ballroom. Their signature tune, 'Tuxedo Junction,' became a jazz standard and a major hit in 1939, though it later achieved even greater commercial success in a version by Glenn Miller. Hawkins's orchestra was known for its driving swing, bluesy undertones, and danceable arrangements, maintaining a hard-swinging style even as other bands became more commercial. The band remained popular through the 1940s and early 1950s, outlasting many contemporaries, and Hawkins continued performing well into his seventies.

Hawkins's legacy endures through his recordings and the many musicians he mentored and inspired. He was a key figure in the development of swing and rhythm-and-blues, and his influence extended to artists such as Ray Charles. Inducted into the Alabama Jazz Hall of Fame as one of its first honorees, Hawkins is remembered as a trailblazer who brought the vibrant sounds of Birmingham and Harlem to national prominence.
