## Biography
Lachlan R. Doley is an Australian musician, singer, and songwriter born and raised in Adelaide, who has developed into one of the world's most celebrated blues, soul, and rock keyboardists.[1][3] Beginning his musical journey as a child, Doley initially pursued university education before joining his older brother Clayton as a session musician in Sydney during the mid-1990s.[1] The brothers reunited in 2002 to form the Hands, a classic rock and soul band that released two albums—Live and Breathe (2004) and Everything Is Wonderful (2008)—establishing Doley's reputation for blending blues, soul, and funk into high-energy performances.[1] His breakthrough came when he provided piano and Hammond organ for Powderfinger's fifth studio album, Vulture Street (2003), and subsequently served as their touring keyboardist from mid-2007 to 2010, significantly raising his profile in the Australian music scene.[1]

Since 2010, Doley has established himself as a solo artist and frontman of the Lachy Doley Group, releasing four albums including S.O.S (Singer Organ Soul) (2013), Conviction (2015), Lovelight (2017)—which peaked at number 40 on the ARIA Albums Chart—and Make or Break (2019).[1] Dubbed 'The Jimi Hendrix of the Hammond Organ' and 'The Jimi Hendrix of the Keyboard,' Doley has earned international recognition for his virtuosic skills on the Hammond organ and whammy clavinet, producing sounds described as intense, ferocious, and sometimes transcendent.[2][3] His career has been marked by collaborations with world-renowned artists including Joe Bonamassa, Glenn Hughes, Jimmy Barnes, Steve Vai, Bootsy Collins, and Billy Thorpe, while performing in over 25 countries at prestigious festivals and venues such as the Byron Bay Blues Festival, Montreal Jazz Festival, and Sydney Opera House.[3][4] In 2024, his first USA tour proved remarkably successful, selling out Nashville's City Winery and achieving over 400 ticket sales each at the Troubadour in Los Angeles and Williamsburg Music Hall in New York.[3]
