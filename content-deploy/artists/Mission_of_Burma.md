## Biography
Mission of Burma was a pioneering American post-punk band formed in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1979. The original lineup featured Roger Miller (guitar, vocals), Clint Conley (bass, vocals), Peter Prescott (drums, vocals), and Martin Swope (tape manipulation, sound engineering). The group quickly became a fixture in Boston's underground music scene, known for their intense live performances and innovative use of tape loops and sonic experimentation, thanks in large part to Swope's contributions. Their early releases, including the EP 'Signals, Calls, and Marches' and the album 'Vs.', were issued on the local Ace of Hearts label and garnered critical acclaim for blending punk energy with art rock sensibilities and avant-garde elements.[1][2][5]

Despite their growing influence, Mission of Burma disbanded in 1983, primarily due to Miller's development of tinnitus from the band's notoriously loud shows. During their brief initial run, they released only a handful of records but left a profound mark on the post-punk genre, inspiring a devoted following and influencing numerous future artists. After nearly two decades apart, the band reformed in 2002—this time with Bob Weston replacing Swope—and released four more studio albums, further cementing their legacy before amicably disbanding again in 2020.[1][5]

Mission of Burma's music is characterized by angular guitar work, driving rhythms, and an experimental approach that incorporated tape loops and noise elements, setting them apart from their contemporaries. Their legacy is reflected in the work of bands like R.E.M., Nirvana, and Moby, who have cited Mission of Burma as an influence and even covered their songs. The band's willingness to push boundaries and their enduring impact on alternative and indie rock have made them a touchstone for generations of musicians.[1][3][5]

## Fun Facts
- The band's name was inspired by a plaque reading 'Mission of Burma' that Clint Conley saw on a New York City diplomatic building, which he thought sounded mysterious and evocative.[1]
- Martin Swope, the band's original tape manipulator, often worked from behind the scenes, leading audiences to wonder how the trio on stage was producing such complex sounds.[2][5]
- Mission of Burma's early single 'Academy Fight Song' became the most-played song of 1979 on MIT's WMBR radio station, even before the band had released a record label-backed single.[1]
- Roger Miller's hearing issues (tinnitus) from the band's loud performances were a primary reason for their initial breakup in 1983.[1][5]
