## Biography
Charles Fulcher (1896–1958) was an American clarinetist, violinist, composer, and bandleader best known for directing Fulcher's Novelty Orchestra, an Augusta, Georgia-based dance band active in the early 20th century[1][2]. Fulcher's musical journey began in the Southern United States, where he developed his skills as both a performer and arranger, eventually leading one of the region's most prominent jazz and ragtime ensembles. His orchestra gained recognition for its energetic performances and innovative arrangements, blending ragtime rhythms with early jazz sensibilities.

Fulcher's Novelty Orchestra achieved national attention through its recordings for Okeh Records and Columbia Records, notably participating in the historic 1923 Nassau Street Sessions in Atlanta, which marked the first commercial 'on location' recording sessions outside of Northern studios[1][2]. These sessions were pivotal in capturing the authentic sounds of Southern jazz and dance bands, with Fulcher's group contributing two tracks released in both the United States and Germany. The orchestra performed widely, from Miami to Chicago, and was celebrated for its lively dance music and skilled musicianship.

Fulcher's legacy lies in his role as a regional pioneer who helped bridge the gap between ragtime and early jazz, influencing the development of Southern dance band music. His work with Fulcher's Novelty Orchestra not only showcased his talents as a multi-instrumentalist and director but also contributed to the broader recognition of Southern musicians in the national recording industry. Though not as widely known today, his recordings remain valued by jazz historians for their historical significance and musical quality[1][2].
