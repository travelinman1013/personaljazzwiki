## Biography
Lonnie Plaxico, born September 4, 1960 in Chicago, Illinois, emerged from a deeply musical family and began playing bass at age twelve, teaching himself both electric and acoustic instruments. By fourteen, he was already performing professionally in Chicago’s vibrant jazz, funk, and blues scene, making his first recording with his family’s band and quickly gaining recognition for his prodigious talent[1][2][4][7][8].

He gained major public attention as a member of Art Blakey’s Jazz Messengers from 1983 to 1986, recording twelve albums including the Grammy-winning 'New York Scene.' Plaxico was also a founding participant in the innovative M-Base collective, contributing to the debut releases of Steve Coleman, Cassandra Wilson, and Greg Osby. His tenure with Jack DeJohnette’s Special Edition from 1986 to 1993 further showcased his versatility and creativity[1][2][4][5][7].

Plaxico’s musical style is rooted in jazz fusion, marked by technical virtuosity, rhythmic sophistication, and openness to experimentation. He is especially noted for his long-standing role as musical director and bassist for Cassandra Wilson, shaping her distinctive sound for over fifteen years. Plaxico’s legacy includes Grammy-winning collaborations, a diverse discography as both leader and sideman, and a reputation for bridging tradition and innovation in modern jazz[1][2][4][5][7].
