## Biography
Sam Myers was born on February 19, 1936, in Laurel, Mississippi. At age seven, he developed juvenile cataracts, leaving him legally blind for life despite corrective surgery; he learned Braille and could only make out shapes and shadows. Myers became interested in music as a schoolboy in Jackson, Mississippi, mastering trumpet and drums well enough to earn a scholarship to the American Conservatory of Music in Chicago. By night, he immersed himself in the vibrant South Side club scene, sitting in with legendary blues artists such as Jimmy Rogers, Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, Little Walter, Hound Dog Taylor, Robert Lockwood Jr., and Elmore James[2][4].

Myers began his professional career as a drummer for Elmore James, playing with him regularly from 1952 until James's death in 1963 and contributing to many historic Chess Records sessions. In 1956, Myers wrote and recorded his most famous single, "Sleeping in the Ground," which would later be covered by Blind Faith, Eric Clapton, and Robert Cray. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Myers performed extensively on the Chitlin' Circuit, fronted the Mississippi Delta Blues Band from 1979 to 1982, and toured internationally with Sylvia Embry and the Mississippi All-Stars Blues Band[2][4].

A major career resurgence came in 1986 when Myers joined Anson Funderburgh & The Rockets as their featured vocalist and harmonica player, a partnership that lasted until his death in 2006. Myers's powerful, soulful vocals and expressive blues harp became hallmarks of the band's sound, earning them W.C. Handy Awards and international acclaim. Myers's legacy lies in his authentic Delta blues style, his innovative harmonica work, and his role as a bridge between classic blues traditions and modern blues performance[2][1][3].
