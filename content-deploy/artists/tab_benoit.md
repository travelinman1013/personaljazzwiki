## Biography
Tab Benoit, born November 17, 1967, in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and raised in Houma, is a celebrated American blues guitarist, singer, and songwriter. Immersed in the rich musical traditions of southern Louisiana from an early age, Benoit was drawn to the guitar as a teenager and began frequenting the Blues Box club in Baton Rouge, run by Tabby Thomas. There, he played alongside legendary musicians such as Raful Neal and Henry Gray, absorbing the authentic blues styles that would shape his own musical identity[1][2][4][5].

Benoit formed his first trio in 1987 and quickly established himself on the local club circuit in Baton Rouge and New Orleans. By 1991, he was touring nationally, and his debut album "Nice and Warm" (1992) garnered critical acclaim, earning him comparisons to blues greats like Albert King, Albert Collins, and Jimi Hendrix[3][4][5]. Benoit's style blends Delta blues, swamp blues, soul blues, and Cajun influences, marked by his distinctive use of a stock 1972 Fender Telecaster Thinline and a gritty, soulful vocal approach. Despite industry pressures to pursue a more rock-oriented sound, Benoit has remained steadfastly committed to his Cajun roots, returning to a more traditional blues sound with albums like "These Blues Are All Mine" (1999)[4][5].

Beyond his musical achievements, Benoit is a passionate environmental advocate. In 2003, he founded the "Voice of the Wetlands" organization to raise awareness about coastal wetlands preservation in Louisiana. His legacy includes not only a prolific recording and touring career but also significant contributions to conservation efforts and the cultural preservation of Louisiana's musical heritage. Benoit was inducted into the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame in 2010 and continues to inspire audiences with his energetic performances and dedication to the blues[2][9].
