## Biography
Leo's Sunshipp was a short‑lived but highly regarded U.S. funk and soul studio group active in the late 1970s, best known for their mellow, jazz‑tinged modern soul sound and the cult album *We Need Each Other* (1978).[1][3][5][7] The project revolved around three singers and writers—Kenny Stover, Johnny Simone (often spelled Simon), and Alvin (Allen) Few—who had worked extensively in the soul scene and all shared the astrological sign of Leo, inspiring the group’s name.[2][4][7] Prior to forming Leo’s Sunshipp, the members were particularly connected to Marvin Gaye’s circle; sources describe them as ex–Marvin Gaye backing or associated vocalists and writers, bringing with them a polished Motown‑bred approach to vocal harmony and arrangement.[3][5]

The group’s sessions produced a refined blend of smooth mid‑’70s soul, jazz‑funk, and disco, characterised by warm harmonies, elegant horn and string arrangements, and understated, danceable grooves.[3][5][6][7] Their sole album, *We Need Each Other*, recorded around 1977–78, showcased this sound on tracks like “Give Me the Sunshine” and “I’m Back for More,” which later became highly prized among modern soul, rare groove, and jazz‑funk collectors.[3][5][7] Although Leo’s Sunshipp did not achieve major commercial success at the time and disbanded soon after the album’s release, their work gained posthumous recognition through reissues and DJ culture, cementing the group’s legacy as a cult favorite in 1970s jazz‑funk and sophisticated soul.[3][5][7]

Despite the project’s brevity, Leo’s Sunshipp’s material has remained influential in underground circles, often cited for its seamless mix of laid‑back, sun‑drenched soul with jazzy chord progressions and subtle disco inflections.[3][5][6][7] The scarcity of original pressings and the mysterious, almost one‑off nature of the group have added to their legend, and *We Need Each Other* is now frequently highlighted by reissue labels, specialist record stores, and soul aficionados as a hidden gem of the era.[1][3][5][7]
