## Biography
Bobby Black, born Robert Lee Black in Prescott, Arizona in 1934, is a legendary pedal steel guitarist whose career spans over seven decades and bridges the worlds of Western swing, country, rock, and Hawaiian music[1][3]. By age eight, Black had moved to Burbank, California, where he was first exposed to the sounds of Harry Owens and the Royal Hawaiians, sparking a lifelong passion for the steel guitar[2][3]. He and his brother Larry began studying piano as children, but Bobby quickly gravitated toward the steel guitar, starting his professional journey in the early 1950s playing Western swing and country behind some of the era’s biggest names[1].

Black’s career took a pivotal turn in 1971 when he joined Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen, a move that brought him into the rock and counterculture scene and significantly raised his profile[1]. His virtuosic playing became a defining element of the band’s classic lineup, and he later brought his talents to Asleep at the Wheel and the New Riders of the Purple Sage, helping to keep Western swing and country-rock alive during a period when the steel guitar had fallen out of mainstream favor[1][3]. Black’s style is noted for its technical precision, jazz-influenced improvisation, and a distinctive Hawaiian tonal flavor, reflecting his deep roots in American roots music and his openness to genre-blending innovation[1][3]. Now based in Northern California, Black remains a sought-after session player and a living link between the golden age of steel guitar and its modern practitioners[1][3].

## Fun Facts
- Bobby Black was initially hesitant to join Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen, thinking they were 'dreamers,' but his eventual decision transformed the band’s sound and legacy[1].
- He is one of the few pedal steel players to have performed with both Western swing pioneers and rock bands, bridging generations and genres[1][3].
- Black’s love for Hawaiian music never left his playing, and he even performed in Hawaii after meeting his hero Jerry Byrd during a vacation[1].
- Despite his long career, Black never sought the spotlight, preferring to let his playing speak for itself—a humility that endeared him to peers and fans alike[3].
