## Biography
Jorja Alice Smith, born on 11 June 1997 in Walsall, West Midlands, England, is an English singer-songwriter known for her soulful voice and introspective songwriting. She began writing songs at the age of 11 and was classically trained in piano, oboe, and classical singing during her school years, earning a music scholarship at Aldridge School. Her early exposure to diverse genres such as reggae, punk, hip-hop, and R&B shaped her eclectic musical style. Smith was discovered after a friend uploaded her cover of Labrinth's "Earthquake" to YouTube in 2012, leading to her signing with Sony/ATV in 2016. She released her debut EP "Project 11" in 2016, followed by her critically acclaimed debut album "Lost & Found" in 2018, which peaked at number three on the UK Albums Chart and won her the Brit Critics' Choice Award. Her music blends neo-soul, R&B, UK garage, and elements of spoken word, often featuring moody and introspective themes.

Smith's collaboration with UK garage producer Preditah on the 2017 single "On My Mind" is a notable highlight, showcasing a tribute to classic UK garage and rave culture. This collaboration helped cement her presence in the UK music scene alongside other high-profile collaborations with artists like Drake, Stormzy, Kali Uchis, and Kendrick Lamar. After moving to London at 18 to pursue her career, she balanced day jobs with music writing and performing, steadily building her reputation through both solo projects and collaborations. Her third EP, "Be Right Back" (2021), continued to receive favorable reviews, further establishing her as a versatile and influential artist in contemporary British music.
