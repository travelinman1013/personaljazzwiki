## Biography
Raymond Matthews Brown (October 13, 1926 – July 2, 2002) was an American jazz double bassist whose big, warm tone, flawless time, and unshakable swing made him one of the most in-demand bassists in modern jazz. Born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, he began formal music studies on piano at around eight years old, becoming an accomplished young pianist before switching to bass in high school when a shortage of bassists in the school orchestra created an opportunity.[1][3][6][7] By his late teens he was working professionally in local clubs, touring first with the Jimmy Hinsely Sextet and then with bandleader Snookum Russell, experiences that gave him a grounding in territory bands and the emerging idiom of bebop.[1][3][6]

In 1945–46 Brown moved to New York, where pianist Hank Jones introduced him to Dizzy Gillespie; Gillespie hired the 19‑year‑old bassist on the spot for his experimental big band at the heart of the bebop revolution, placing Brown alongside Charlie Parker, Bud Powell, and Max Roach.[1][2][4] Brown soon recorded seminal bebop sides such as “One Bass Hit” and “A Night in Tunisia,” appeared in Gillespie’s film *Jivin’ in Be-Bop*, and worked with Art Tatum and Charlie Parker.[1][2] In 1947 he married Ella Fitzgerald, serving as her musical director and touring with his own trio while also helping to found the group that would evolve into the Modern Jazz Quartet.[1][2][4] From 1951 until 1966 Brown was the anchor of the Oscar Peterson Trio and a mainstay of Norman Granz’s Jazz at the Philharmonic tours, achieving international recognition for his resonant sound, impeccable intonation, and ability to drive a small group with orchestral authority.[1][2][3][4]

After leaving Peterson’s trio in 1966, Brown settled in California and became one of the busiest freelance and studio musicians in Los Angeles, appearing on more than 2,000 recordings and working with stars including Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennett, and many others.[3][4][8] He co‑founded the L.A. Four with Bud Shank, Laurindo Almeida, and Shelly Manne in the 1970s, led his own acclaimed trios from the 1980s onward, and recorded prolifically for the Concord and Telarc labels.[1][2][3][5] Stylistically he combined a huge, centered tone with advanced harmonic understanding and astonishing technical facility, influencing almost every modern jazz bassist who followed.[4][6][8] Brown also composed, taught at the Advanced School of Contemporary Music in Toronto, mentored younger musicians such as Diana Krall, and remained an active performer until his death in Indianapolis in 2002, by which time he was widely regarded as an elder statesman of jazz bass whose legacy spans six decades of recorded history.[2][3][4][5][6][8]

## Fun Facts
- Brown originally trained as a pianist and only switched to bass in high school because there were already too many pianists and a shortage of bass players in the school orchestra.[1][3][6]
- In 1960 he commissioned a custom hybrid instrument combining features of the cello and double bass, an experiment that later inspired Ron Carter’s development of the piccolo bass.[1]
- Brown composed the tune “Gravy Waltz,” which won a Grammy Award and became the theme song for the Steve Allen Show in the late 1960s.[3]
- He appeared on Steely Dan’s track “Razor Boy” from the 1973 album *Countdown to Ecstasy*, an unusual rock‑jazz crossover for a mainstream jazz bassist.[2]
