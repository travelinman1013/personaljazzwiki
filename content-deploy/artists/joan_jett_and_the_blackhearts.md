## Biography
Joan Jett & The Blackhearts is an American rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1980 by Joan Jett, following her tenure with the pioneering all-female group The Runaways. After The Runaways disbanded in 1979, Jett faced repeated rejections from major labels but, undeterred, she teamed up with producer Kenny Laguna to independently release her debut solo album. This DIY approach led to the founding of Blackheart Records, one of the first artist-owned labels in rock, and set the stage for her next chapter.

With the formation of The Blackhearts, Jett assembled a band that would help define her signature sound: raw, energetic rock with punk undertones and a rebellious spirit. Their 1981 album 'I Love Rock 'n Roll' became a landmark release, with the title track dominating the charts and becoming an enduring anthem. Over the decades, Joan Jett & The Blackhearts have released numerous albums, with hits like 'Crimson and Clover,' 'I Hate Myself for Loving You,' and 'Bad Reputation,' earning gold and platinum certifications. Jett's influence as a trailblazing female rocker and her defiant, empowering image have made her a role model and icon in popular music.

Joan Jett & The Blackhearts' legacy is marked by their induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2015, recognition on Rolling Stone's list of greatest guitarists, and their ongoing impact on generations of musicians. Jett is often called the 'Godmother of Punk' and is celebrated for her activism, business acumen, and commitment to breaking barriers for women in rock.
