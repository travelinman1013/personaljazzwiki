## Biography
George Porter Jr., born December 26, 1947, in New Orleans, Louisiana, is an American bassist, songwriter, and vocalist widely recognized as one of the founding fathers of funk music. Growing up in a musically rich household—his father frequently listened to Duke Ellington while his mother sang in the local church choir—Porter developed his passion for music early. As a teenager, he became friends with future Meters bandmate Joe "Zigaboo" Modeliste, who lived next door, and the two played jam sessions together. Inspired by fellow New Orleans bassist Benjamin "Poppi" Francis, who gave him lessons, Porter was drawn to the bass guitar. His talent caught the attention of Art Neville, who approached him after Porter sat in with Earl King, asking him to join a new band that would eventually become The Meters.

Formed in the mid-1960s, The Meters—consisting of Art Neville, Leo Nocentelli, Zigaboo Modeliste, and Porter—became one of the progenitors of funk, creating groundbreaking syncopated polyrhythms and grooves rooted in New Orleans' deep African musical heritage. Porter's heavy pocket and fat bass lines formed the foundation behind funk classics like "Cissy Strut," their signature 1969 instrumental that reached No. 4 on the R&B chart and No. 23 on the Billboard Hot 100. The group also served as the house band for Allen Toussaint's label, performing as session musicians on numerous hit records including "Right Place, Wrong Time," "Lady Marmalade," "Sneakin' Sally Through the Alley," and "Southern Nights." By 1975, they were touring as the opening act for the Rolling Stones. Despite disbanding in 1977 due to personal differences, The Meters reformed in 1989 for reunion performances, with Porter and Neville later forming the Funky Meters to keep the spirit alive until Neville's retirement in 2018 and death in 2019.

Beyond The Meters, Porter has enjoyed an illustrious career spanning over five decades. He formed his own group, the Runnin' Pardners, in 1990, which he describes as "more of a funk-rock band with a taste of R&B." He has collaborated with an impressive array of artists including Paul McCartney, Jimmy Buffett, David Byrne, Patti LaBelle, Robbie Robertson, Tori Amos, Dr. John, Warren Haynes, Johnny Adams, Harry Connick Jr., Dead & Company, and many others. Porter joined John Scofield's Piety Street Band in 2008 and replaced Reed Mathis in Bill Kreutzmann's band, 7 Walkers, in 2010. His other projects include The Trio with Johnny Vidacovich, New Orleans Social Club, Deep Fried, and Porter Batiste Stoltz. The Meters received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award at the 60th Annual Grammy Awards in 2018 and have been nominated four times for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

## Fun Facts
- Porter credits his best musical moment as when The Meters were opening for the Rolling Stones in Paris in 1976. The crowd started booing them until Keith Richards and Mick Jagger came out in support, told the crowd to shut up and listen to the music, keeping The Meters alive at that crucial time.
- The Meters were originally called Neville Sound and consisted of seven members including vocalists Cyril and Aaron Neville and saxophonist Gary Brown, before being trimmed down to the core four-piece that became legendary.
- Porter and future Meters drummer Zigaboo Modeliste grew up next door to each other in New Orleans and became friends when George was 10 years old, playing jam sessions together with Porter on a box guitar before he even picked up the bass.
- The Meters played six nights a week at a Bourbon Street bar called Ivanhoe when they were discovered by Allen Toussaint, who asked them to sign a record deal and suggested they change their name to something that better reflected their sound, leading to "The Meters."
