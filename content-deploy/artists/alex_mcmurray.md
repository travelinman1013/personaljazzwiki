## Biography
Alex McMurray is a songwriter, singer, and guitarist best known as a long‑time fixture of the New Orleans music scene. Born and raised in Red Bank, New Jersey, he moved to New Orleans in 1987 at age eighteen to attend Tulane University, and was soon playing iconic local venues such as the Maple Leaf Bar, Café Brasil, and Tipitina’s.[2][8] Immersing himself in the city’s bar-band culture, he began working as a sideman before forming his own groups, most notably the jazz‑rock outfit Royal Fingerbowl, which gained national attention in the 1990s and released its debut album *Happy Birthday Sabo!* in 1997 on TVT Records.[1][2][3] By 1989 he was performing professionally around town, gradually becoming identified with a gritty, downtown New Orleans lifestyle of sketchy bars, cracked sidewalks, and hard‑lived stories that would define much of his songwriting.[1][4]

After Royal Fingerbowl disbanded in 2001, McMurray broadened his scope with solo projects and new bands, while remaining rooted in New Orleans. A six‑month stint in 2002 singing sea shanties for Tokyo Disney inspired him to found the Valparaiso Men’s Chorus, dedicated to sailor songs and maritime repertoire.[1][2] He released his first solo album *Banjaxed* in 2003 (often dated 2003–2004) and followed it with *How To Be a Cannonball* in 2009, which won Album of the Year at the 2010 Big Easy Awards, beating heavyweight nominees such as Allen Toussaint and Terence Blanchard.[1][2] Alongside his solo work he co‑founded the Tin Men (with Washboard Chaz Leary and Matt Perrine) and the vintage Jamaican pop band 007, both of which became regular award‑winners in New Orleans and staples of events like Jazz Fest.[1][2] His songs—darkly humorous, world‑weary, and steeped in New Orleans imagery—have been featured on television (including the series *K‑Ville* and HBO’s *Treme*), and he has appeared on screen as himself, reinforcing his status as one of the city’s quintessential contemporary songwriters.[1][2]

McMurray’s musical style draws on jazz, rock, folk, sea shanties, and classic New Orleans rhythm‑and‑blues, often delivered with hard‑boiled wit and a deliberately dour, melancholic edge that he has described as finding beauty in sorrow and loneliness.[1] He has fronted or played in a wide array of New Orleans groups—including Tin Men, the Valparaiso Men’s Chorus, 007, Happy Talk Band, and projects with Paul Sanchez, Ingrid Lucia, and others—while organizing the fringe festival Chaz Fest as an alternative, neighborhood‑scale answer to Jazz Fest.[1] Having played Jazz Fest in one configuration or another every year since the mid‑1990s and survived numerous Mardi Gras seasons, he is widely regarded as a core figure in the post‑1980s New Orleans songwriter community, chronicling the city’s joys and traumas (from Hurricane Katrina to everyday hangovers) with wry, literate songs that have earned him a devoted local following and critical respect.[1][2]

## Fun Facts
- Before becoming a full‑time bandleader, Alex McMurray worked a string of non‑music jobs around New Orleans, including dishwashing, ditch‑digging, substitute teaching, and more, while gradually building his career in the club scene.[1]
- In 2002 he spent six months at Tokyo Disney performing traditional sea shanties, an experience he later described as the loneliest period of his life and which directly led to the formation of the Valparaiso Men’s Chorus.[1][2]
- His song “The Day After Mardi Gras Day” from *Banjaxed* was used in the Fox television series *K‑Ville* and later slated for the closing credits of an episode of HBO’s *Treme*, where McMurray also appeared as himself.[1][2]
- McMurray co‑founded the neighborhood‑based Chaz Fest in New Orleans, a fringe festival that runs alongside Jazz Fest and showcases local acts, underscoring his role as both performer and grassroots organizer in the city’s music community.[1]
