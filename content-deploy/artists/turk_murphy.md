## Biography
Melvin Edward Alton "Turk" Murphy (1915–1987) was a pioneering American trombonist and bandleader, renowned for his dedication to traditional and Dixieland jazz. Born in Palermo, California, Murphy studied music theory before taking up the cornet and trombone, eventually moving to San Francisco in 1939. There, he joined forces with trumpeter Lu Watters to co-found the Yerba Buena Jazz Band, which became a cornerstone of the San Francisco jazz revival and helped define the city's unique approach to ensemble jazz[1][2][3].

After World War II service in the Navy, where he played and recorded with Lu Watters and Bunk Johnson, Murphy formed his own band in 1952, leading the Turk Murphy Jazz Band for over three decades. His group performed at iconic venues such as Earthquake McGoon's, a club he co-founded in 1960 that became a hub for jazz in San Francisco and a gathering place for musicians and fans alike[1][3][5]. Murphy's style, which he termed "Traditional Jazz," emphasized New Orleans roots and energetic ensemble playing, setting it apart from the more soloist-driven Dixieland style. He was a prolific arranger and composer, known for both reviving classic jazz repertoire and creating new works in the genre.

Murphy's legacy is marked by his commitment to preserving and popularizing early jazz, his influence on generations of musicians, and his role in bringing jazz to wider audiences through television appearances, international tours, and collaborations with artists in other media. His final major performance was a sold-out concert at Carnegie Hall in 1987, a testament to his enduring impact on American jazz[1][2][3].
