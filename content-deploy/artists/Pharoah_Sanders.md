## Biography
Pharoah Sanders, born Ferrell Lee Sanders on October 13, 1940, in Little Rock, Arkansas, was a pioneering American jazz saxophonist whose career spanned over five decades and left an indelible mark on the genres of free jazz and spiritual jazz[2][3]. Growing up in a musical family during the Jim Crow era, Sanders began his musical journey on the clarinet, accompanying church hymns, before discovering the tenor saxophone in high school under the guidance of band director Jimmy Cannon[3][6]. His early exposure to jazz in Little Rock’s segregated clubs and his move to Oakland, California, after high school, where he studied art and music and performed with local musicians, laid the foundation for his eclectic style—encompassing bebop, rhythm and blues, classical, and free jazz[1][4].

In 1961, Sanders relocated to New York City, where he struggled initially but soon became a central figure in the avant-garde jazz scene, mentored by Sun Ra and profoundly influenced by John Coltrane, with whom he played in the mid-1960s on landmark albums such as Ascension and Meditations[1][2]. Sanders’ own recordings, beginning with Tauhid in 1967 and including the iconic Karma (1969), showcased his distinctive sound—marked by overblowing, multiphonics, and a spiritual intensity that became his signature[1][2]. Over his career, Sanders released more than thirty albums as a leader, evolving from the raw, expressionistic free jazz of his early years to a more meditative, lyrical approach in later decades, without ever losing the emotional depth that defined his work[1][4]. Sanders passed away on September 24, 2022, in Los Angeles, leaving behind a legacy as one of the last icons of his generation and a defining voice in spiritual jazz[2][7].
