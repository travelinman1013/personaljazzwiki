## Biography
Henri Herbert is a French-born, UK-raised boogie-woogie and blues pianist known for his ferocious technique, high-energy performances, and viral street-piano videos. Growing up, he immersed himself in his father’s record collection and was drawn, unusually for his generation, to 1950s rock ’n’ roll and early boogie-woogie rather than contemporary Britpop, styling his hair like Elvis and obsessing over Jerry Lee Lewis, Little Richard, and Chuck Berry.[2] He began playing piano as a child, and by his early teens he was already busking and gigging, cutting his teeth on stages and streets across Europe and absorbing the language of classic boogie and blues piano.[1][3] These formative years cemented his identity as a specialist in a driving, rhythm-first piano style that connects the barrelhouse tradition to modern rock energy.

Herbert’s professional profile rose sharply after he joined London rock ’n’ roll band The Jim Jones Revue in 2011, touring the world and appearing at major festivals such as Glastonbury and Rock en Seine, as well as performing on Late Night with David Letterman.[3][4] When the band disbanded in 2014, he launched a solo career and a band project, The Fury, releasing records including the live album "Live at Gypsy Hotel" and the solo set "Boogie Woogie Piano" while playing an intense touring schedule across Europe and the United States.[4][1] A spontaneous performance on a public piano at London’s St Pancras Station went viral and has accumulated tens of millions of views, helping establish him as one of the most visible boogie-woogie pianists of his generation.[4][5] Herbert later relocated to the United States, settling first in Austin, Texas, where he immersed himself in the city’s roots music scene,[1][3] and more recently making his home in Nashville, Tennessee, while touring widely as a soloist and earning a U.S. green card based on his distinction as a blues and boogie pianist.[5]

Musically, Herbert channels the lineage from early 20th‑century boogie-woogie through mid‑century rock ’n’ roll into contemporary blues and rock contexts, emphasizing a powerful left-hand groove and explosive right-hand runs designed to make people dance.[1][2] He cites pioneers such as Jerry Lee Lewis, Albert Ammons, Pete Johnson, Fats Domino, and Memphis Slim as central inspirations and has collaborated with major figures including Rolling Stones keyboardist Chuck Leavell on the two‑piano feature “Sixth Avenue Express” from his album "Boogie Till I Die."[1][2][3] With more than 65–70 million views on his St Pancras videos alone and over 100 million total online views,[1][5][7] along with high-octane live shows from Lithuania to Hawaii, Herbert has helped bring boogie-woogie and traditional blues piano to new audiences, reinforcing the style’s place as a foundational pillar of modern rock ’n’ roll.[2][7]

- [[fats_domino|Fats Domino]] - Early rock ’n’ roll and R&B piano hero whose records Herbert cites as part of the piano-pounding tradition that shaped his approach. (General stylistic influence from Fats Domino’s piano recordings.) [Listening influence from youth onward (1990s–present)[5]]
