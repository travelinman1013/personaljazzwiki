## Biography
Sweet Emma Barrett, born March 25, 1897, in New Orleans, Louisiana, was a pioneering self-taught jazz pianist and singer whose career spanned over seven decades. She began playing piano at age seven and was performing publicly by the age of twelve, quickly becoming a fixture in the vibrant New Orleans music scene. Despite never learning to read music, Barrett possessed an exceptional ear and could transpose pieces instantly, a skill that made her highly sought after among local bands and musicians. Her early career was marked by her work with Oscar 'Papa' Celestin's Original Tuxedo Jazz Orchestra from 1923 to 1936, followed by collaborations with notable bandleaders such as William Ridgely, Armand Piron, John Robichaux, and Sidney Desvigne.

Barrett's musical style was characterized by a strident, barrelhouse approach to piano and a vocal delivery infused with humor and double entendre, drawing inspiration from early female blues singers. She was known for her eccentric stage presence, often performing in a red beanie cap and garters adorned with tinkling bells, earning her the nickname 'the bell gal.' After a period of semi-retirement, she returned to prominence in the late 1940s and, in 1961, made her recording debut with the Riverside Records 'New Orleans: The Living Legends' series. The 1960s marked the peak of her career as she became a central figure in the Preservation Hall Jazz Band, touring internationally and recording several influential albums.

Despite suffering a stroke in 1967 that left her partially paralyzed, Barrett continued to perform with undiminished spirit, playing piano with only her right hand and captivating audiences until her death in 1983. Her legacy endures as a trailblazer for women in jazz, a beloved ambassador of New Orleans music, and an inspiration to countless musicians who followed in her footsteps.
