## Biography
Chico Freeman, born Earl Lavon Freeman Jr. on July 17, 1949, in Chicago, Illinois, is a renowned modern jazz tenor saxophonist, trumpeter, composer, and bandleader. The son of legendary saxophonist Von Freeman, Chico grew up immersed in a rich musical environment, taking early piano lessons and later picking up the trumpet before focusing on the saxophone during his college years at Northwestern University. After graduating with a degree in music, he taught at the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians School of Music and earned a master's degree in composition and theory, further deepening his musical foundation.

Freeman's career blossomed in the late 1970s, with his debut as a leader on the album 'Morning Prayer' in 1976. He became a prominent figure in the modern jazz movement, known for blending traditional jazz with contemporary influences. In 2002, Freeman formed the band Guataca, releasing the album 'Oh By the Way...' which showcased his innovative approach to Latin jazz, fusing Afro-Cuban rhythms with elements of hip-hop and modern jazz. Throughout his career, Freeman has collaborated with a diverse array of artists across genres and has been recognized for his contributions to jazz with awards such as the New York Jazz Award and Stereo Review's Record of the Year. His legacy is marked by his adventurous spirit, technical mastery, and commitment to expanding the boundaries of jazz through global musical fusion.
