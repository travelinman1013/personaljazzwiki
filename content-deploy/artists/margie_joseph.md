## Biography
Margie Joseph, born Margaret Marie Joseph in Pascagoula, Mississippi in 1950, emerged from a strong religious upbringing and began her musical journey singing in her church choir[2][3][5]. While attending Dillard University in New Orleans, she pursued a professional singing career, recording demos at Muscle Shoals Sound Studio that led to her first deal with the Okeh label[2][4]. Her earliest releases met with limited success, but she persevered, soon finding recognition with Volt Records through hits like 'Your Sweet Lovin'' and her soulful reinterpretation of the Supremes' 'Stop! In the Name of Love,' which established her as a rising star in the soul genre[1][2][3].

Throughout the 1970s, Joseph recorded for major labels including Atlantic and Stax, achieving her greatest commercial success with the single 'My Love,' a cover of Paul McCartney's song, which reached the R&B Top Ten in 1974[1][3]. Her albums from this period, such as 'Margie Joseph Makes a New Impression,' 'Sweet Surrender,' and 'Margie,' showcased her versatile vocal style, blending elements of Philly soul, classic soul, and northern soul. Joseph's ability to infuse pop and country songs with deep emotion and soulfulness—evident in her covers of Al Green's 'Let's Stay Together' and Dolly Parton's 'Touch Your Woman'—earned her critical acclaim and comparisons to Aretha Franklin[1][3][4].

After a vibrant secular career, Joseph retired from mainstream recording to focus on family and dedicate herself to gospel music and community service, performing at churches and non-profit events throughout Mississippi and neighboring states[2]. Her legacy endures as one of Mississippi's greatest soul singers, admired for her expressive voice, resilience, and contributions to the evolution of soul music.
