## Biography
Dee Dee Sharp was born Dione LaRue on September 9, 1945, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. From an early age, she demonstrated musical talent, playing piano and directing choirs at her grandfather's church and other Philadelphia churches. At just 13 years old, when her mother suffered debilitating injuries from a car accident, Sharp took on the responsibility of supporting her family by pursuing a singing career. She began as a backing vocalist, working on recording sessions with prominent artists including Lloyd Price, Frankie Avalon, Fabian, Bobby Rydell, Jackie Wilson, and Chubby Checker. Her breakthrough came in 1962 when she was featured on Chubby Checker's duet "Slow Twistin'," which became a top 10 hit. This success led producers Kal Mann and Bernie Lowe of Cameo-Parkway Records to sign her as a solo artist and rename her Dee Dee Sharp—a name derived from her nickname "Dee" and the musical key "D sharp" in which she sang.

Sharp's solo career exploded with her debut single "Mashed Potato Time" in 1962, which became her signature song and a number one hit, establishing her as the nation's first Black female teen idol. Throughout the early 1960s, she achieved a string of Billboard Hot 100 top 10 hits including "Gravy (For My Mashed Potatoes)" (1962), "Ride!" (1962), and "Do the Bird" (1963). Her proximity to Philadelphia and its thriving music scene, combined with her frequent appearances on Dick Clark's American Bandstand from 1962 to 1981 and the Caravan of Stars tours, provided significant promotional opportunities that sustained her visibility. In 1967, she married Kenny Gamble of the legendary songwriting and production duo Gamble & Huff, recording under the name Dee Dee Sharp Gamble for Gamble Records and Philadelphia International Records. During the disco era, she experienced a career resurgence with her version of 10 CC's "I'm Not In Love" and achieved chart success with "Breaking and Entering" (1981), which spent four weeks at number one on the Hot Dance Club Play chart.

Beyond her recording career, Sharp became a fixture in popular culture, appearing in films including Desperately Seeking Susan, Don't Knock the Twist, Hairspray, Sister Act, and Troop Beverly Hills. She was inducted into the Philadelphia Music Alliance Walk of Fame in 1987, cementing her legacy as a pioneering figure in R&B and pop music. Though her chart success diminished after 1966, Sharp maintained a lengthy and notable career through television appearances, tours, concerts, and club dates that took her around the world. Her contributions to early 1960s pop and R&B music, particularly as a dance music innovator and teen idol, remain significant in music history.

## Fun Facts
- Sharp was engaged to boxer Muhammad Ali in 1964 after he defeated Sonny Liston for the heavyweight title in Miami. However, Malcolm X reportedly told her they could only marry if she converted to Islam, and her mother called off the engagement when she learned of this conversion requirement.
- Her stage name "Dee Dee Sharp" was created by producers Kal Mann and Bernie Lowe based on two elements: her brother's nickname for her ("Dee") and the musical key in which she sang ("D sharp").
- Sharp was the nation's first Black female teen idol, achieving this distinction with her debut single "Mashed Potato Time" in 1962, which was inspired by the popular dance craze of the era.
- She appeared on American Bandstand over 50 times between 1962 and 1981, making her a regular fixture on Dick Clark's iconic television show and helping to promote every one of her record releases.
