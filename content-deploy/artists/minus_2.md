## Biography
Minus Two was a progressive rock band founded in 1971 in Mannheim, Germany by organ player Günter Kühlwein and drummer Walter Helbig. Kühlwein had previously appeared as a guest musician on DZYAN's 1972 album, while Helbig brought experience from his work with Nine Days Wonder and Aera. The band emerged during a fertile period for experimental and progressive music in Europe, positioning themselves within the broader context of complex, rhythmically adventurous rock music that would later influence the development of math rock and post-hardcore genres.

- Walter Helbig brought experience from two different progressive groups (Nine Days Wonder and Aera) before co-founding Minus Two, indicating a well-established progressive rock community in Germany
