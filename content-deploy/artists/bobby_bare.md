## Biography
Bobby Bare (born Robert Joseph Bare Sr. on April 7, 1935) is an American country singer and songwriter whose career helped bridge traditional country, folk storytelling, and the emerging outlaw sensibility. Raised in poverty in the river town of Ironton, Ohio, near the Kentucky and West Virginia borders, he lost his mother at age five and spent much of his youth working odd jobs while absorbing the sounds of the Grand Ole Opry and singing-cowboy heroes like Gene Autry and Roy Rogers.[1][2][3][6] In the 1950s he moved through semi‑pro bands, early radio and TV work, and a handful of unsuccessful rock‑and‑roll singles for labels such as Capitol, even cutting the demo for “The All American Boy,” which became a hit when released under his friend Bill Parsons’s name while Bare was drafted into the U.S. Army.[1][2][3] After his discharge he continued to struggle until Chet Atkins signed him to RCA Victor in 1962, leading to hits like “Shame on Me” and “Detroit City,” the latter earning Bare a Grammy Award for Best Country & Western Recording and establishing him as a major country star.[1][2][4]

Through the 1960s and 1970s Bare developed a distinctive laconic vocal style and wry, literate song choices that drew on country, folk, and pop, helping to pioneer a folk‑country blend with songs such as “500 Miles Away from Home,” “Four Strong Winds,” and “Miller’s Cave.”[1][3][4] He moved from RCA to Mercury in 1970, scoring hits with early Kris Kristofferson compositions like “Come Sundown” and “Please Don’t Tell Me How the Story Ends,” then later returned to RCA and subsequently recorded for Columbia and EMI America.[1][4][5] Bare became known for championing unconventional material, especially from songwriter Shel Silverstein, resulting in concept albums such as *Lullabys, Legends and Lies* and story songs like “Marie Laveau,” as well as children’s and novelty tunes that still carried strong narrative craft.[1][4] Between 1962 and 1983 he placed nearly five dozen singles on the country Top 40 and continued to record and tour into later decades, ultimately being inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2013 in recognition of his influence on both mainstream and outlaw country.[2][4][6]

Bare’s legacy rests on his role as a creative outlier within Nashville: he pushed for artistic control, experimented with horns and strings in country arrangements, recorded songs by Bob Dylan, Townes Van Zandt, the Rolling Stones, and other non‑Nashville writers, and used his clout to help introduce artists like Waylon Jennings and Rosanne Cash to wider audiences.[1][4][5] Promoter Bill Graham once dubbed him “the Bruce Springsteen of country” for his blue‑collar narratives and crossover credibility, and Bare later hosted the songwriter‑focused TV series *Bobby Bare and Friends* on The Nashville Network in the 1980s, further cementing his reputation as a champion of songcraft.[4] In 1998 he formed the supergroup Old Dogs with Jerry Reed, Mel Tillis, and Waylon Jennings, underscoring his standing among the genre’s elder statesmen, and he remains regarded as a key link between classic Nashville country, folk storytelling, and the outlaw movement.[1][4][6][8]

## Fun Facts

- He was among the first Nashville artists to use horns on a country record, convincing producer Chet Atkins to try the idea on “Shame on Me,” which helped launch his career at RCA.[4]
- Promoter Bill Graham reportedly nicknamed him “the Bruce Springsteen of country” in 1977 because of his blue‑collar storytelling and strong following among rock and college audiences.[4]
- From 1983 to 1988, Bare hosted the television show “Bobby Bare and Friends” on The Nashville Network, focusing on songwriters who performed and discussed their own hits.[1][4]
