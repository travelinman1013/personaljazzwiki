## Biography
Radiohead are an English art rock and alternative rock band formed in 1985 at Abingdon School in Abingdon, Oxfordshire, England, by Thom Yorke, Jonny Greenwood, Colin Greenwood, Ed O’Brien, and Philip Selway.[2][3] The five classmates initially rehearsed in the school music room under the name On a Friday, reflecting their regular rehearsal day, and were strongly influenced by American alternative bands such as R.E.M., the Pixies, and by British groups including U2 and The Smiths.[1][2][3] After university, they regrouped in Oxford, signed to EMI/Parlophone in 1991, adopted the name Radiohead from the Talking Heads song "Radio Head," and released their debut album *Pablo Honey* in 1993, whose single "Creep" became a global hit and introduced their blend of introspective lyrics and guitar-driven alternative rock.[1][2][3]

With *The Bends* (1995) and especially *OK Computer* (1997), Radiohead evolved into one of the most acclaimed rock bands of their era, expanding their sound with layered guitars, intricate production, and themes of alienation and technology; *OK Computer* is frequently cited as a landmark album in popular music.[2][3] They radically shifted direction with *Kid A* (2000) and *Amnesiac* (2001), embracing electronic textures, jazz, and 20th‑century classical influences, and later experimented with distribution by self‑releasing *In Rainbows* (2007) as a pay‑what‑you‑want download, a move that reshaped industry conversations about digital music.[2][3] Subsequent albums such as *The King of Limbs* (2011) and *A Moon Shaped Pool* (2016) continued their exploration of rhythm, looping, orchestral arrangements, and atmospheric production, cementing Radiohead’s legacy as a pioneering, restlessly experimental band whose work has significantly advanced the sound and artistic ambition of alternative rock.[2][3]

Radiohead’s music is characterized by Thom Yorke’s expressive, often falsetto vocals, Jonny Greenwood’s innovative guitar and orchestral work, and a constant willingness to deconstruct rock conventions with electronic production, unusual song structures, and influences from jazz, electronic, and avant‑garde music.[2] They have garnered both commercial success and enduring critical acclaim, frequently appearing in lists of the most important albums and artists in modern music, and are widely regarded as one of the most accomplished art‑rock bands of the early 21st century.[2][3]

## Fun Facts
- "Radiohead" took their name from the Talking Heads song "Radio Head," chosen when they signed to EMI and dropped their original name On a Friday.[1][2]
- During early shows, the song "Creep" was initially so controversial that BBC Radio 1 temporarily blacklisted it as "too depressing," yet it went on to become their breakthrough hit.[2][3]
- Jonny Greenwood famously tried to make "Creep" sound harsher and "sabotage" it by strumming loud, dissonant guitar just before the chorus; that sound became a defining hook of the track.[5]
- Their 2007 album *In Rainbows* was initially released as a digital download with a "pay what you wish" model, a highly publicized experiment that challenged traditional album pricing and distribution.[2][3]
