## Biography
Marlon Jordan, born August 21, 1970, in New Orleans, Louisiana, is the youngest of seven children of musician-educator Edward 'Kidd' Jordan, a prominent avant-garde saxophonist and professor, and Edvidge Jordan, a classical pianist. He began music lessons in third grade, experimenting with saxophone, violin, and drums before settling on the trumpet in fourth grade. His father introduced him to the bandstand early, fostering connections with musicians, and he drew daily inspiration from peers like Wynton Marsalis and Terence Blanchard who practiced at the Jordan household. Graduating from the New Orleans Center for the Creative Arts (NOCCA), Marlon developed skills in both jazz and classical music, performing as a soloist with the New Orleans Symphony Orchestra and Louisiana Philharmonic as a teenager.[1][2][4]

Signed to Columbia Records (Sony) at age 17 as one of the 'Young Jazz Lions,' Jordan released his debut album *For You Only* in 1990, praised by the Washington Post as one of the year's best debuts. He followed with *Learson's Return* (1991), featuring five original compositions, and *The Undaunted* (1992), then *Marlon's Mode* on Arabesque in 1997. His quintet headlined JVC Festivals alongside Wynton Marsalis, Miles Davis, and George Benson, and performed at venues like the Village Vanguard, Blue Note, and Avery Fisher Hall. Stylistically compared to Charlie Parker and John Coltrane, Jordan blends bebop precision with classical technique and New Orleans street performance energy, later releasing *You Don’t Know What Love Is* in 2005 on Louisiana Red Hot Records.[1][2][3][4]

Beyond recording, Jordan has taught at institutions like the Baptiste School of Music and Don Jamison School, toured Brazil, Europe, and on a 2005 U.S. State Department tour to Bucharest, Germany, Lithuania, and Ukraine. His legacy endures through persistent performances in New Orleans nightclubs and streets, embodying the city's jazz tradition while bridging classical and avant-garde influences from his family.[2][4][5]
