## Biography
Daniel Dumile, known professionally as MF DOOM, was born on July 13, 1971, in London to a Trinidadian mother and Zimbabwean father, and moved to Long Island, New York, during his childhood, where he grew up in Freeport and Long Beach.[2][4] As a comic book enthusiast and early DJ from third grade, he debuted in 1988 as Zev Love X in the hip-hop group KMD alongside his brother DJ Subroc, signing with Elektra Records and releasing *Mr. Hood* in 1991, but faced tragedy with Subroc's death in 1993 and the shelving of *Black Bastards* due to its controversial cover, leading to a label drop and Dumile's hiatus marked by homelessness in Manhattan.[1][2][4] Reemerging in the late 1990s at open-mic events with a mask inspired by Marvel's Doctor Doom, he adopted the MF DOOM persona, releasing *Operation: Doomsday* in 1999 and pioneering underground hip-hop with intricate wordplay, obscure samples, and supervillain themes.[2][3][4]

DOOM's career flourished in the 2000s with pseudonyms like King Geedorah and Viktor Vaughn, but his breakthrough came with *Madvillainy* (2004) alongside Madlib, hailed as a masterpiece for its experimental production and dense lyrics, alongside albums like *Mm..Food* (2004).[4][5] His style blended **experimental hip hop**, **jazz rap**, and **alternative hip hop**, drawing from comic books, esoterica, and Nuwaubian Nation influences, while critiquing the music industry through character-driven narratives.[2][5] Relocating to Atlanta and later London in 2009, he retained British citizenship and became a cult icon, dubbed 'your favorite rapper's favorite rapper,' until his death on October 31, 2020, at age 49.[2][5]

DOOM's legacy endures as a transformative figure in underground hip-hop, inspiring generations with his masked mystique, lyrical complexity, and rejection of commercial norms, influencing the genre's shift toward abstract, sample-heavy production.[1][5][7]
