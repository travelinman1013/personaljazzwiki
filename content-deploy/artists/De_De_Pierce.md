## Biography
Joseph De Lacroix "De De" Pierce was born on February 18, 1904, in New Orleans, Louisiana, into a musical Creole family. He began his musical journey in the vibrant jazz scene of New Orleans, learning trumpet from Professor Paul Chaligny and Kid Rena, both respected figures in the city's traditional jazz circles. Pierce's first professional engagement was with Arnold DePass's band in the mid-1920s, quickly establishing himself as a skilled trumpeter and vocalist known for his powerful, blues-inflected style and his ability to sing in both English and Creole French.

De De met pianist and vocalist Billie Pierce in New Orleans nightclubs, and the two married, forming a celebrated musical partnership. Together, they became fixtures in the New Orleans jazz community, serving as the house band at Luthjen's Dance Hall from the 1930s through the 1950s, and collaborating with notable musicians such as Alphonse Picou, "Big Eye" Louis Nelson Delille, and the Barnes brothers. Despite health setbacks in the 1950s that left De De blind, the couple experienced a resurgence in the 1960s, recording for labels like Folklyric, Jazzology, and Riverside, and performing with the Preservation Hall Jazz Band, which brought them international recognition. De De Pierce passed away in New Orleans on November 23, 1973, leaving a legacy as a symbol of pure, unadulterated New Orleans jazz.
