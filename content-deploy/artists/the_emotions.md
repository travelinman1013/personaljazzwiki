## Biography
The Emotions are an American female vocal group from Chicago, Illinois, originally formed in 1957 as the Hutchinson Sunbeams by sisters Wanda Hutchinson (born December 1941), Sheila Hutchinson (born January 1953), and Jeanette Hutchinson (born February 1950), daughters of Joseph 'Joe' Hutchinson, who managed the group. They began performing gospel music in local churches, touring with their father, appearing on TV shows like 'Children's Gospel' and 'The Jerry Van Dyke Show,' and opening for Mahalia Jackson, before transitioning to R&B and soul in the late 1960s. Managed by Pervis Staples, they signed with Stax Records' Volt label in 1968, adopting the name The Emotions, and released their debut album *So I Can Love You* in 1969, produced by Isaac Hayes and David Porter, with the title track hitting No. 3 on the R&B charts.[1][2][4]
