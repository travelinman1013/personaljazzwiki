## Biography
KATSEYE is a multinational six-member girl group formed in 2023 through HYBE and Geffen Records’ global survival show, The Debut: Dream Academy, which drew over 100,000 contestants from around the world. The final lineup—Sophia, Daniela, Megan, Lara, Manon, and Yoonchae—was selected after 12 weeks of rigorous challenges, fan voting, and intensive K-pop style training. The group officially debuted in June 2024 with their single 'Debut,' followed by the viral hit 'Touch,' which propelled them to international recognition and chart success.

KATSEYE’s music blends Western pop sensibilities with the performance rigor and visual style of K-pop, singing primarily in English but representing diverse backgrounds: members hail from the Philippines, the United States, France, and South Korea. Their debut EP, 'SIS (Soft Is Strong),' released in August 2024, promoted themes of empowerment and self-love, resonating with a global audience. Their sophomore EP, 'Beautiful Chaos,' released in June 2025, marked a sonic shift toward hyper-pop and further cemented their reputation as innovative pop artists. The group’s energetic choreography, multilingual appeal, and interactive fan engagement have made them one of the most watched acts in contemporary pop.

Despite their recent debut, KATSEYE has already left a significant mark, earning nominations at major music awards and sparking conversations about the evolution of K-pop and global pop music. Their journey, documented in the series 'Pop Star Academy: KATSEYE,' highlights the group’s resilience and the changing landscape of idol formation in the digital age.
