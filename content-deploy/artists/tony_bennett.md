## Biography
Tony Bennett, born Anthony Dominick Benedetto on August 3, 1926, in Astoria, Queens, New York, was an American jazz and traditional pop singer renowned for his warm, expressive voice and impeccable phrasing[1][6]. After serving as a U.S. Army infantryman in World War II, Bennett pursued music, performing in New York clubs and gaining early attention from Pearl Bailey and Bob Hope, who suggested his stage name and helped launch his career[4][6]. Bennett signed with Columbia Records in 1950, quickly rising to fame with hits like 'Because of You,' 'Cold, Cold Heart,' and 'Rags to Riches.' His artistry flourished in the late 1950s and early 1960s, notably with jazz-influenced albums and his signature song 'I Left My Heart in San Francisco,' which won him two Grammy Awards and became a defining standard[1][3][7].

Throughout his career, Bennett maintained a commitment to classic American standards and jazz, resisting pressures to conform to contemporary trends. Despite struggles in the 1970s, including personal and professional setbacks, he staged a remarkable comeback in the 1980s and 1990s, appealing to new generations through collaborations and live performances, such as his Grammy-winning 'MTV Unplugged' album[1][7]. Bennett's legacy includes more than 50 million records sold, 20 Grammy Awards, and recognition as a National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master. He was also dedicated to arts education, founding the Frank Sinatra School of the Arts in Queens[1][7]. Bennett passed away on July 21, 2023, leaving an indelible mark on American music.
