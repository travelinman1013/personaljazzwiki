## Biography
Irma Thomas, born Irma Lee on February 18, 1941, in Ponchatoula, Louisiana, is celebrated as the 'Soul Queen of New Orleans.' Raised in a working-class family, she began singing in her Baptist church choir as a teenager and won a local talent contest at age eleven. By her late teens, Thomas had already faced significant challenges, including early motherhood and two marriages, but her passion for music persisted. Her big break came in 1959 when, while working as a waitress in New Orleans, she impressed bandleader Tommy Ridgley with her singing and soon landed her first recording contract with Ron Records. Her debut single, 'You Can Have My Husband, But Please Don't Mess With My Man,' became a regional hit and reached #22 on the Billboard R&B charts in 1960.

Thomas's career flourished in the early 1960s after she joined the Minit label, where she collaborated closely with songwriter and producer Allen Toussaint. Together, they created classics like 'It's Raining' and 'Ruler of My Heart,' the latter of which was famously reinterpreted by Otis Redding as 'Pain in My Heart.' Her move to Imperial Records brought her biggest national hit, 'Wish Someone Would Care,' which reached #17 on the Billboard pop charts in 1964. Despite shifts in musical trends and personal setbacks—including the devastation of Hurricane Camille and a period living in California—Thomas remained a beloved performer, especially in New Orleans. She experienced a resurgence in the 1990s, earning Grammy nominations and finally winning the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Blues Album in 2007 for 'After the Rain.'

Irma Thomas is renowned for her emotive, expressive vocal style, which emphasizes storytelling and emotional connection over vocal acrobatics. Her ability to inhabit a song's lyrics with authenticity has made her a revered figure in soul and R&B. Over a career spanning more than six decades, Thomas has become a symbol of resilience and artistry, inspiring generations of musicians and earning her place as a living legend in American music.
