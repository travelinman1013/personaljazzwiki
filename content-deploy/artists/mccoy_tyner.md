## Biography
McCoy Tyner, born Alfred McCoy Tyner on December 11, 1938, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, emerged as one of the most influential jazz pianists of the twentieth century. Raised in a musically vibrant neighborhood, Tyner began piano lessons at age 13, encouraged by his mother and local teachers. Early exposure to jazz greats like Bud Powell and Thelonious Monk, as well as classical training, shaped his distinctive approach. Tyner's professional career began in earnest with the Benny Golson–Art Farmer Jazztet in 1959, but his international reputation was cemented when he joined John Coltrane's legendary quartet in 1960. With Coltrane, Tyner contributed to groundbreaking albums such as 'My Favorite Things,' 'Impressions,' and the spiritual masterpiece 'A Love Supreme,' helping to define the sound of modern jazz through his powerful, modal harmonies and percussive style.

After leaving Coltrane's group in 1965, Tyner established himself as a prolific bandleader and composer, recording over eighty albums across a range of settings—from trios to big bands. His music incorporated African, Latin, and Eastern influences, and he became known for his innovative use of block chords, pentatonic scales, and rhythmic complexity. Tyner's solo work, including albums like 'The Real McCoy,' 'Sahara,' and 'Fly With The Wind,' further expanded the boundaries of jazz piano. Over his career, he received five Grammy Awards, the National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master Award, and an honorary doctorate from Berklee College of Music. Tyner passed away on March 6, 2020, leaving a legacy celebrated for its spiritual depth, technical brilliance, and enduring influence on generations of musicians.
