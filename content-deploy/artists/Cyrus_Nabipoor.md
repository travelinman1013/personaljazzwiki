## Biography
Cyrus Nabipoor is a trumpeter, composer, arranger, and educator who was born and raised in Portland, Oregon. He began playing trumpet at age 11 with a memorable origin story—he originally wanted to play trombone, but it wouldn't fit on his bike. As an adolescent, he studied with Cynthia Plank and trumpeter Derek Sims, and in high school joined the Alan Jones Academy of Music. His early musical foundation in Portland would prove instrumental in shaping his distinctive voice that bridges genres with warmth and lyricism.

Nabipoor earned his Bachelor of Music from Loyola University New Orleans, graduating magna cum laude and receiving the outstanding undergraduate award in both Jazz and Brass. While at Loyola, he studied with Nick Volz, Tony Dagradi, and Jimbo Walsh. He also spent a formative term at the Grieg Academy in Bergen, Norway, studying with ECM legend Per Jørgensen and Martin Winter of the Bergen Philharmonic. In 2015, he was awarded the prestigious International Trumpet Guild Jazz Scholarship. Today, Nabipoor splits his time between New Orleans and his hometown of Portland, where he remarkably lives in the very house where he grew up.

As a performing artist, Nabipoor has developed a unique voice that defies easy categorization, flowing effortlessly through jazz, funk, rock, and experimental improvisation. He's equally adept with acoustic trumpet and electronic effects, using a solo effect-loop setup to explore new tonal possibilities. He leads several projects including NORUZ, his own quintet and trio, and is a member of bands like Brass Lightning, Outer Core, Sexual Thunder, and Doombalaya. He has performed at major festivals including the Portland Jazz Festival, New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, French Quarter Festival, and has worked with notable artists such as Jamison Ross, Elle King, Tarriona "Tank" Ball, Jason Marsalis, Steve Masakowski, Stanton Moore, and Dean Ween. As an educator, he serves on faculty at Loyola University New Orleans, works as an Artist-in-Residence at multiple Portland Public High Schools including his alma mater Grant High School, and maintains a private studio. He is endorsed by Edwards Trumpets and has partnerships with PreSonus and Horn FX.
