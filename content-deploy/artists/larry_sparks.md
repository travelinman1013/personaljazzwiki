## Biography
Larry Eugene Sparks was born on September 25, 1947, in Lebanon, Ohio, the youngest of nine children in a musical family where siblings and his father played guitar and clawhammer banjo. His interest in music began at age five, influenced by his sister Bernice teaching him guitar, family recordings, church singing, and radio performances of religious music. By age thirteen around 1960, he played locally with regional groups in Ohio and Indiana, later joining high school country and rock bands before transitioning to bluegrass. In 1964, at seventeen, he joined the Stanley Brothers as lead guitarist after a recommendation from banjo player Wilbur Hall to Moon Mullins, then became lead vocalist and guitarist for Ralph Stanley's Clinch Mountain Boys following Carter Stanley's death in 1966, recording standards like 'I Only Exist,' 'Sharecropper's Son,' and 'Going Up Home To Live in Green Pastures.'[1][2][3]

Sparks left Ralph Stanley in late 1969 to form the Lonesome Ramblers, initially with David Cox, Lloyd Hensley, Joe Isaacs, and sister Bernice Sparks, recording for Pine Tree, Old Homestead, Starday, King Bluegrass, and Rebel Records starting in 1977. His style blends soulful, high-lonesome vocals with bluesy guitar, earning him headliner status at bluegrass festivals. Notable albums include 'Ramblin’ Guitar' (1970), 'Footsteps of Tradition' (1974), and '40' (2005), celebrating 40 years in bluegrass. He won IBMA Male Vocalist of the Year in 2004 and 2005, Album of the Year and Recorded Event of the Year for '40' in 2005, and was inducted into the International Bluegrass Music Hall of Fame in 2015.[1][2][3]

Sparks' legacy endures through decades of performances, band leadership with rotating top musicians, and contributions to bluegrass standards, maintaining traditional sounds while incorporating gospel and newgrass elements as reflected in his Spotify genres.[1][2][3]
