## Biography
Dub Colossus is the visionary project of Nick Page, known as Dubulah, a prolific UK composer, guitarist, bass player, and programmer of Greek/UK origin born in Germany. His early career began in a school reggae band in Hackney, east London, followed by avant-garde experiments in squats, and collaborations with reggae star Mykaell Riley, shifting from Bartok-inspired sounds to styles of the Mighty Diamonds, Black Uhuru, and Steel Pulse. He co-founded Transglobal Underground with Tim Whelan and Hamid Mantu, releasing six albums blending global influences, before forming Temple of Sound with Neil Sparkes and producing for artists like Natacha Atlas.[1][2][3][4]

In 2006, Dubulah traveled to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, inspired by the Ethiopiques CD series, to explore Azmari traditions, 60s Ethiopian pop, Ethiojazz, and 70s Jamaican dub reggae, leading to the birth of Dub Colossus. He collaborated with Ethiopian talents including vocalists Tsedenia Gebremarkos and Sintayehu 'Mimi' Zenebe, pianist Samuel Yirga, saxophonist Feleke Hailu, and Azmari violinist Teremage Woretaw. Their debut album, A Town Called Addis (2008, Real World Records), fused these elements with reggae rhythms and dub effects, earning critical acclaim and sparking extensive tours across Europe, Glastonbury, WOMAD, and New Zealand.[1][2][3]

Dub Colossus evolved from a studio project into a dynamic live band, with follow-up albums like Addis Through the Looking Glass recorded partly in Addis Ababa using improvised studios. The project's style innovatively merges Ethiopian golden-era jazz, Azmari folk, and dub reggae from influences like the Abyssinians, revitalizing Ethiopia's suppressed music scene post-Mengistu regime while showcasing a big-band sound that transports audiences to Addis dancehalls.[1][2][3]

## Fun Facts
- Ethiopian collaborators like Tsedenia, Mimi, Feleke, Samuel, and Teremage traveled to Real World Studios in the UK for the first time outside Ethiopia to complete A Town Called Addis.[2]
- The second album was recorded in a makeshift Addis studio in Abiyou Solomon's house, using cupboards as vocal booths and dealing with loud rain on the tin roof.[2]
- Dubulah once lived in a Stepney squat with one cold water tap and large rats while pursuing avant-garde composition before embracing reggae.[2]
- Dub Colossus debuted with 180 shows in 9 months during early band efforts, overlapping with the 2 Tone scene in 1979-1982.[3]
