## Biography
Ryan Keberle & Collectiv do Brasil is a cross-continental jazz ensemble led by acclaimed American trombonist, composer, and educator Ryan Keberle. Born in 1980 in Bloomington, Indiana and raised in Spokane, Washington, Keberle grew up in a musically rich environment, influenced early on by his father, Dan Keberle, a respected jazz educator. After establishing himself in New York’s vibrant jazz scene and earning accolades for his work with ensembles like Catharsis and Reverso, Keberle’s fascination with Brazilian music led him to São Paulo in 2017, where he met pianist Felipe Silveira, bassist Tiago Alves (later Felipe Brisola), and drummer Paulinho Vicente—three of São Paulo’s most sought-after musicians. Their instant musical chemistry gave birth to Collectiv do Brasil, a group dedicated to exploring the deep connections between jazz and Brazil’s sophisticated music traditions, especially the post-bossa nova movement known as música popular brasileira (MPB).

The group’s debut album, 'Sonhos da Esquina,' recorded at São Paulo’s Gargolandia Recording Studio, pays tribute to the music of Milton Nascimento and Toninho Horta, blending original compositions and creative arrangements that highlight the universal language of Afro-centric music traditions. Their subsequent albums, including 'Considerando' and 'Choro das Águas,' further explore the works of legendary Brazilian composers like Edu Lobo and Ivan Lins, reimagining their songs as modern jazz vehicles. Keberle’s trombone, renowned for its vocal-like expressiveness, brings a unique emotional resonance to the ensemble’s sound, evoking the Brazilian sentiment of 'saudades.' Collectiv do Brasil has been praised for its ability to transcend genres, cultures, and traditions, creating a vibrant and evocative musical realm that resonates with audiences worldwide.
