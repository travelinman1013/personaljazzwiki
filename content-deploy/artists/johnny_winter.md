## Biography
Johnny Winter, born John Dawson Winter III on February 23, 1944, in Beaumont, Texas, emerged as one of the most influential American blues guitarists and singers of the 20th century[5][1]. Growing up in a racially tense environment, Winter was deeply drawn to the blues, often venturing into black neighborhoods to play and learn from local musicians—a testament to his authenticity and passion for the genre[1]. He formed his first band, Johnny and the Jammers, at age 15 with his brother Edgar, and quickly gained recognition for his prodigious talent.

Winter's career accelerated after a legendary performance at the Fillmore East in 1968, which led to a record-breaking contract with Columbia Records[2]. His self-titled album in 1969 and subsequent appearance at Woodstock solidified his reputation as a guitar virtuoso, blending raw blues with rock energy. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Winter released acclaimed albums such as "Johnny Winter And" and "Still Alive and Well," and became a key figure in bridging British blues-rock with American Southern rock[1].

A passionate champion of the blues, Winter revitalized the careers of legends like Muddy Waters by producing and playing on several Grammy-winning albums. His signature electric slide guitar style and soulful vocals influenced generations of musicians, and he remained a torchbearer for authentic blues until his passing in 2014. Winter's legacy endures through his recordings, collaborations, and the many artists he inspired[1][5].
