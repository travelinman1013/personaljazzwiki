## Biography
The Chocolate Dandies was not a single fixed band but rather a name used for several influential African American jazz ensembles active from the late 1920s through the 1940s. The name originated from the 1924 Broadway musical 'The Chocolate Dandies,' written by Eubie Blake and Noble Sissle, and was later adopted by jazz groups led by prominent musicians such as Don Redman and Benny Carter. The first jazz recordings under this name were made in 1928 by a small group drawn from McKinney's Cotton Pickers, with Don Redman as the de facto leader. This early lineup included jazz luminaries like Rex Stewart, J.C. Higginbotham, Coleman Hawkins, Fats Waller, and Benny Carter, and was notable for its innovative arrangements and progressive style, sometimes experimenting with instrumentation and ensemble roles.

Throughout the 1930s and into the 1940s, the Chocolate Dandies name was used for various small groups, often led by Benny Carter. These ensembles featured a rotating cast of some of the era's top jazz musicians, including Chu Berry, John Kirby, Max Kaminsky, Buck Clayton, and others from Carter's and Fletcher Henderson's bands. The group was known for its sophisticated swing arrangements, blending elements of big band, swing, and ragtime, and for pushing the boundaries of small group jazz with creative solos and ensemble interplay. Their recordings, such as 'Birmingham Breakdown' and 'Stardust,' are considered milestones in early jazz and helped set the stage for later developments in swing and modern jazz.

Although the Chocolate Dandies as a group ceased to exist after the 1940s, their legacy endures through their pioneering recordings and the influential careers of their members. The ensemble served as a proving ground for some of jazz's greatest talents and contributed significantly to the evolution of jazz ensemble playing, improvisation, and arrangement.

## Fun Facts
- The group's name was inspired by a 1924 Broadway musical, and not originally conceived as a jazz band.
- Don Redman, the initial leader, chose to leave his name off the early record labels, allowing the ensemble's identity to stand on its own.
- The Chocolate Dandies sometimes recorded without drums, a rarity for jazz groups of the era, and experimented with dual saxophone and trumpet solos.
- Josephine Baker, before her rise to international stardom, was in the chorus line of the original 'Chocolate Dandies' Broadway show.
