## Biography
Glen Gray, born Glenn Gray Knoblauch on June 7, 1900, in Roanoke, Illinois, was a renowned American jazz saxophonist and leader of the Casa Loma Orchestra. His early life was marked by musical inclinations, starting with the piccolo and later transitioning to the clarinet and saxophone. Gray attended the American Conservatory of Music in 1921 but left to pursue a career in music, playing with various orchestras in Peoria and Detroit. In the late 1920s, he joined the Orange Blossoms, which later became the Casa Loma Orchestra after a stint at the Casa Loma hotel in Toronto. The orchestra was notable for being one of the first cooperative bands, with members owning stock. By the mid-1930s, Gray's leadership and the band's appearances on radio shows like the *Camel Caravan* increased their popularity. Despite losing momentum by the 1940s, Gray revived the band's sound in the 1950s through recordings with Capitol Records. Gray passed away on August 23, 1963, in Plymouth, Massachusetts, leaving behind a legacy in big band and swing music. The Casa Loma Orchestra's style blended hot jazz with sentimental ballads, making them a precursor to the swing era popularized by Benny Goodman. Gray's leadership and the band's unique sound contributed significantly to the evolution of jazz and dance music during the early 20th century.
