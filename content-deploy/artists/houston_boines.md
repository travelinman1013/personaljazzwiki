## Biography
Houston Boines (December 30, 1918 – November 8, 1970) was an American blues singer and harmonica player born in Hazlehurst, Mississippi.[1][2] Little is documented about his early life, but he emerged in the blues scene during the post-World War II era, performing in the Mississippi Delta region as part of the downhome blues tradition.[2][3]

Boines' career centered on a single known recording session in 1952 for Modern Records, where he was accompanied by guitarist Charley Booker, capturing his raw, emotive harmonica and vocal style in tracks featured on compilations like *The Modern Downhome Blues Sessions Vol. 2: Mississippi & Arkansas 1952*.[2][3] His music exemplified classic blues with gritty, regional Delta influences, though his obscurity stems from limited commercial output and regional performances.[1][5]

Boines passed away in 1970, leaving a modest legacy as a niche figure in Mississippi blues history, appreciated by collectors for his authentic downhome sound preserved in rare recordings.[1][2]

## Fun Facts
- Boines shares a birthday with Houston Stackhouse, another Mississippi blues figure, both born December 30, 1918, though no direct connection is documented.
- His recordings are extremely rare, primarily known through 1952 Modern Records sessions reissued on later compilations.
- Despite the blues hotspot of Hazlehurst, Mississippi, Boines remains one of its most obscure native sons with minimal discography.
