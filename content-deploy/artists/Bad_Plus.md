## Biography
The Bad Plus is a pioneering American jazz group formed in Minnesota in 2000, though its founding members—bassist Reid Anderson, drummer Dave King, and pianist Ethan Iverson—had played together for over a decade prior to their official debut[7][2]. Their early years were marked by a shared vision to challenge jazz conventions, blending influences from rock, pop, and classical music with improvisational jazz. The trio's first major release, 'These Are the Vistas,' made a significant impact by reimagining the piano trio format for the 21st century, drawing on source material from artists like Nirvana, Tears for Fears, and David Bowie rather than the traditional jazz canon[2][3]. Their energetic performances and inventive covers quickly established them as one of the most talked-about groups of the early 2000s, helping to pave the way for a new generation of genre-blurring jazz ensembles[2].

Over the next two decades, The Bad Plus released a dozen albums featuring both original compositions and imaginative reinterpretations of works ranging from pop hits to Stravinsky's 'Rite of Spring.' The band underwent several lineup changes: Iverson departed in 2017, replaced by pianist Orrin Evans, who contributed to two albums before leaving in 2021[1][4]. Rather than seeking another pianist, Anderson and King reinvented the group as a quartet, adding guitarist Ben Monder and saxophonist Chris Speed. This new configuration debuted with an eponymous album, continuing the band's legacy of pushing boundaries and exploring fresh sonic territory[1][6]. Throughout their evolution, The Bad Plus has maintained a collective ethos focused on creative risk-taking, group identity, and a commitment to the 'song' as a personal statement[1][5].

The band's legacy is defined by its fearless approach to genre, its role in redefining modern jazz ensembles, and its influence on contemporary acts such as GoGo Penguin. Their willingness to evolve—whether through lineup changes or stylistic shifts—has kept their music vital and relevant, earning them a reputation as trailblazers in jazz fusion and nu jazz[2][3].
