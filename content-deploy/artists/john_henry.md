## Biography
Because “John Henry” is a very common name, there are multiple musicians and musical figures with this name, spanning different eras and genres. Available web sources point to at least one historically significant Welsh musician active in the late 19th–early 20th century, as well as several contemporary American artists and performers using the name “John Henry” in rock, jazz, and related styles.[1][2][8][9] None of these can be reliably matched to the specific Spotify profile you referenced (genres unknown, low popularity), so attributing a single, unified biography to “JOHN HENRY” as a Spotify artist would risk conflating several different people.

One clearly documented historical musician named **John Henry (1859–1914)** was a Welsh baritone singer, composer, and conductor born at Portmadoc (now Porthmadog), Caernarfonshire, Wales.[1] Raised in a musical family, he joined the Caernarvon Volunteers band and astonishingly became its conductor at around age thirteen.[1] By seventeen he was successfully competing as a baritone soloist, and at twenty‑one he entered the Royal College of Music in London, later establishing himself as a singing teacher in London and then Liverpool.[1] He composed popular Welsh songs such as “Teyrn y Dydd,” “Galwad y Tywysog,” “Cân y Bugail,” “Cenwch im yr hen Ganiadau,” and “Gwlad y Delyn,” along with part‑songs like “Nos Ystorm,” the cantata “Olga,” and the opera “Caradog.”[1] Henry also performed as a soloist in major choral‑orchestral works including “The Messiah,” “Elijah,” and “Samson,” and remained active in the musical life of Liverpool until his death there on 14 January 1914.[1]

Given the absence of clear linkage between this historical Welsh musician and the anonymous, low‑metadata Spotify profile, as well as the existence of several unrelated modern artists named John Henry, a precise, Spotify‑specific biographical narrative cannot be produced without guessing. The information provided below therefore focuses on the well‑documented Welsh musician John Henry (1859–1914) only, and does not claim to describe the Spotify artist you found unless that profile can be independently verified as referring to the same person.
