## Biography
Nina Becker, born on July 21, 1974, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, is a multifaceted artist known as a singer, composer, and scenographer. She emerged as a prominent figure in the contemporary Brazilian music scene, initially gaining recognition as a member of the Orquestra Imperial, a collective of Rio musicians that included notable artists such as Kassin, Thalma de Freitas, Moreno Veloso, and Rodrigo Amarante. Before releasing her own albums, Becker was already celebrated for her vocal talent, winning the APCA (Associação Paulista de Críticos de Arte) award for Best Singer in 2009 and being named one of the most influential artists of her generation by Bravo! magazine.

Becker's music is characterized by its sophisticated yet accessible sound, often featuring collaborations with other leading figures in Brazilian music.
