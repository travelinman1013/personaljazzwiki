## Biography
Corey Ledet was born and raised in Houston, Texas, spending his summers in the small Creole community of Parks, Louisiana, where Zydeco music permeated daily life. His grandfather, Buchanan “Tbu” Ledet, a drummer who worked with Zydeco pioneer Clifton Chenier, provided his earliest musical lessons, instilling a deep connection to the genre's roots. By age ten, Ledet was drumming for Wilbert Thibodeaux and the Zydeco Rascals, and by twelve, he backed his aunt, Rosie Ledet, appearing on at least five of her albums between 1994 and 2000, including the breakout *Zydeco Sensation* (1997).[1][2][4]

In 2003, after high school graduation, Ledet moved to Louisiana full-time, transitioning from drums to accordion—the genre's signature instrument—and formed his band Corey Ledet Zydeco. His debut album *3 Years 2 Late* (2004) marked his emergence, blending tradition with innovation. He collaborated with Cedric Watson on *Goin’ Down to Louisiana* (2006) and earned a Grammy nomination for *Nothin’ But the Best* (2012), solidifying his status as a modern Zydeco leader. Ledet studied originators like Clifton Chenier, John Delafose, and Boozoo Chavis, mastering various accordions and infusing old and new styles into his high-energy, dance-driven sound.[1][3][4]

Ledet's career highlights include Grammy experiences, international tours like Russia, and recent projects reclaiming Louisiana Creole language (Kouri-Vini) on albums like *Médikamen* (2023), produced with Louis Michot and featuring guests such as Anders Osborne and Kermit Ruffins. His music preserves Zydeco's Creole heritage while evolving it for new audiences, maintaining a strong presence on the Louisiana-Texas dance scene.[3][5]
