## Biography
Bola Sete, born Djalma de Andrade in Rio de Janeiro in 1923, emerged from an Afro-Brazilian family deeply rooted in the cultural memory of Africa. Growing up in poverty, he was drawn to music early, training in European classical guitar while absorbing the rhythms of samba and the improvisational spirit of jazz. His nickname, meaning 'black seven ball,' was given by jazz bandmates and referenced the black ball in snooker, a nod to both his heritage and his singular presence in Brazil’s music scene.

Sete’s career flourished in Brazil during the post-World War II musical boom, but his international breakthrough came after a pivotal meeting with jazz trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie in 1962. Gillespie invited Sete to New York, leading to recordings of bossa nova standards and performances that showcased Sete’s virtuosic blend of samba, jazz, and classical influences. Relocating to the United States, Sete became a fixture in the Northern California music scene, collaborating with jazz luminaries and captivating audiences in venues ranging from jazz clubs to rock festivals. His style, marked by percussive rhythms, intricate harmonies, and improvisational freedom, defied easy classification and inspired admiration from peers and critics alike.

Despite being overshadowed by the bossa nova craze and later musical trends, Sete left a profound legacy as a bridge between Brazilian and American music. He influenced generations of guitarists with his technical mastery and genre-blurring artistry, and his recordings—both solo and collaborative—remain touchstones for fans of Brazilian jazz and fingerstyle guitar.
