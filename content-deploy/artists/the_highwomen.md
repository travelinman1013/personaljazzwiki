## Biography
The Highwomen is an American country music supergroup formed in 2019, consisting of Brandi Carlile, Natalie Hemby, Maren Morris, and Amanda Shires. The group originated from Amanda Shires' vision in 2016 to create a female counterpart to the legendary Highwaymen, aiming to address the underrepresentation of women in country music and foster connections among female artists. Shires, inspired by the lack of women on country radio, reached out to producer Dave Cobb, who encouraged her to contact Brandi Carlile. Together, they recruited Maren Morris and Natalie Hemby, finalizing the lineup after months of collaboration and songwriting.[1][2][4]

The Highwomen made their live debut at Loretta Lynn's 87th birthday concert in Nashville in April 2019, followed by a celebrated performance at the Newport Folk Festival, where they were joined onstage by Dolly Parton. Their self-titled debut album, released in September 2019 by Elektra Records, features songs that blend Americana, country, and folk influences, with lyrics championing female empowerment, solidarity, and resilience. Tracks like "Highwomen"—a reimagining of the Highwaymen's classic—"Redesigning Women," and "Crowded Table" exemplify their mission to elevate women's voices in country music.[1][2][3][4]

The Highwomen are widely recognized for their advocacy and mentorship within the industry, serving as role models for a new generation of female musicians. Their collaborative approach and commitment to inclusivity have left a lasting mark on country and Americana music, challenging traditional gender roles and inspiring broader conversations about representation and equality.[2][3][4]
