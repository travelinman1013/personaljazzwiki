## Biography
Hoodna Orchestra is a dynamic collective formed in 2012 in the southern Tel Aviv neighborhood of Florentin, Israel. The group originated as a gathering of musicians and composers united by a deep appreciation for Afrobeat, initially rehearsing and performing at the Hoodna Bar, which became their creative headquarters. Over time, the ensemble expanded both in size—reaching up to 12 or 14 members—and in musical scope, weaving together influences from West African funk, psychedelic rock, hard funk, soul, jazz, and, notably, East African music, especially Ethiopian jazz.[1][2][3][4][8]

The orchestra’s evolution was marked by a growing fascination with Ethiopian sounds, particularly the Ethio-jazz pioneered by Mulatu Astatke. This interest led to collaborations with Ethiopian artists such as singer Tesfaye Negatu and, most recently, a landmark partnership with Astatke himself for the 2024 album 'Tension.' Produced by Neal Sugarman of the Dap-Kings, the album showcases Hoodna’s brass-heavy, rhythmically intense style alongside Astatke’s signature vibraphone and Ethiopian scales, earning international recognition and airplay from outlets like BBC Radio 6 Music.[1][2][4][6]

Hoodna Orchestra’s musical style is defined by its fusion of African jazz, funk, and local Israeli influences, reflecting the diverse ethnic makeup of Tel Aviv. Their legacy lies in bridging genres and cultures, introducing Ethio-jazz and Afrobeat to new audiences, and fostering creative collaborations that push the boundaries of contemporary jazz and world music.[1][3][4]
