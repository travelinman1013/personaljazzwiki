## Biography
Brass-A-Holics is a dynamic New Orleans-based band founded in 2010 by trombonist Winston Turner, whose vision was to merge the city's iconic brass band tradition with the infectious rhythms of Washington D.C.'s go-go music. Turner, a graduate of St. Augustine High School and Southern University, drew on his extensive experience with groups like The Soul Rebels Brass Band and The Pinstripes Brass Band to create a new genre he dubbed 'Go-Go Brass Funk.'[1][3][5]

The ensemble features core New Orleans brass elements—trumpet, trombone, saxophone—augmented by a full drum set, percussion, keyboard, bass, and electric guitar, allowing for a rich, versatile sound that pushes the boundaries of both genres. Brass-A-Holics quickly became known for their electrifying live performances, blending original compositions with inventive covers of artists ranging from Miles Davis and John Coltrane to Nirvana and Kanye West. Their music is characterized by high-energy improvisation, melodic horn lines, and a rhythmic foundation rooted in both African and American traditions.[2][3]

Over the years, Brass-A-Holics has recorded live albums and mixtapes, including 'Word On The Street: The Live Video Album,' and has performed at major venues and festivals, leaving a lasting impact on the New Orleans music scene. Their innovative fusion of styles has inspired a new generation of musicians and contributed to the evolution of contemporary brass band music.[2][3]
