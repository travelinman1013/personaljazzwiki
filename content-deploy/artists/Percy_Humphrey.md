## Biography
Percy Humphrey (January 13, 1905 – July 22, 1995) was a celebrated New Orleans jazz trumpeter whose career spanned more than seven decades and embodied the evolution of traditional jazz in his hometown. Born into a distinguished musical family—his grandfather, Professor Jim Humphrey, was a pivotal early jazz educator, and his father, Willie Humphrey Sr., was a clarinetist—Percy began his musical journey on drums before switching to trumpet under his grandfather's tutelage. He gave his first public performance at age six alongside his brother Willie in their grandfather’s band, and by the early 1920s, he was performing professionally with Willie Cornish’s band and later with Kid Howard’s orchestra, even touring as far as Chicago.

The Great Depression forced Humphrey to briefly step away from full-time music, but he returned in the 1940s to lead the Eureka Brass Band, becoming its last leader and recording landmark albums such as 'Jazz at Preservation Hall, Volume 1: The Eureka Brass Band of New Orleans' (1962). He also led his own Crescent City Joymakers and was a founding member and co-leader of the Preservation Hall Jazz Band, helping to shape its touring strategy and international reputation from the 1960s onward. Humphrey’s trumpet style was marked by originality and a deep connection to the New Orleans tradition, eschewing showmanship for soulful, melodic improvisation. He continued to perform into his nineties, with his final appearance at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival in 1995, just months before his passing.

Humphrey’s legacy is deeply entwined with the preservation and global dissemination of New Orleans jazz. His leadership in the Eureka Brass Band and the Preservation Hall Jazz Band, as well as his collaborations with family and local legends, cemented his role as a bridge between the earliest days of jazz and its modern revival. His influence extended through his family, his bands, and the countless musicians who played alongside him, ensuring the endurance of the New Orleans brass band tradition.
