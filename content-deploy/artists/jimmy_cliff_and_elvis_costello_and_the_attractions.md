## Biography
Elvis Costello, born Declan Patrick MacManus on August 25, 1954, in London, England, is a British singer-songwriter who emerged as a pivotal figure in the punk and new wave movements of the late 1970s. Raised in both London and Liverpool following his parents' separation in 1962, Costello was immersed in music from an early age through his father Ross McManus, a musician and bandleader, and his mother Lillian, a record-store manager. During the early 1970s, he performed under the name D.P. MacManus in various bands, including the pub-rock group Flip City with producer Nick Lowe, while working as a computer programmer. In 1977, he adopted the stage name Elvis Costello—taking the first name from his musical idol Elvis Presley and the last name from his paternal great-grandmother—and signed with Stiff Records, launching a career that would span over five decades.

Costello's debut album, My Aim Is True (1977), recorded at Pathway Studios with the backing band Clover, established him as a distinctive voice in popular music, featuring the enduring ballad "Alison" and showcasing his sharp, often political songwriting. Following this success, he formed The Attractions with Steve Nieve (keyboards), Pete Thomas (drums), and Bruce Thomas (bass), with whom he recorded influential albums including This Year's Model (1978) and Armed Forces (1979). Originally branded as an "angry young man" for his snarky, whip-smart lyrics, Costello progressively expanded his musical palette throughout his career, incorporating country, jazz, R&B, baroque pop, and classical influences. His stylistic versatility and prolific output—spanning new wave, power pop, soul, big band, and reggae—established him as one of the most important songwriters of his generation, earning him induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2003 and a Grammy Award in 1998.

Beyond his work with The Attractions, Costello has performed with The Imposters since the early 2000s and collaborated with diverse artists including the Mingus Big Band, the Metropole Orkest, The Jazz Passengers, and the Count Basie Orchestra. His influence extends across multiple genres and generations of musicians, and he continues to perform publicly after more than fifty years in the music industry. Costello's legacy reflects his commitment to artistic evolution and his refusal to be confined by genre conventions, making him a transformative figure in contemporary popular music.

## Fun Facts
- Costello's stage name origin involves a common misconception: while 'Elvis' correctly honors Elvis Presley, 'Costello' is not derived from comedian Lou Costello as often believed, but rather from his paternal great-grandmother Elizabeth Costello's maiden name.
- He legally changed his name to Elvis Costello in 1977, then changed it back to Declan Patrick Aloysius MacManus in 1986 (though 'Aloysius' was not one of his original middle names), and subsequently used both names professionally, typically performing under the Costello moniker.
- Costello is a multi-instrumentalist proficient in guitar, harmonica, and piano, and is known for his trademark black horn-rimmed glasses, which became an iconic part of his visual identity.
- He has twin sons, Dexter Henry Lorcan and Frank Harlan James, born December 6, 2006, with his wife Diana Krall, a renowned pianist and singer-songwriter.
