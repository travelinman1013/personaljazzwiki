## Biography
Harold Edwin Burrage (March 30, 1931 – November 26, 1966) was a Chicago-born blues and soul singer, pianist, songwriter, and record producer whose career traced the evolution of postwar Black American music. Burrage began his professional journey at age 19, recording the energetic 'Hi-Yo Silver' for Decca Records in 1950, backed by Horace Henderson's band. Over the next decade, he recorded for several labels, including Aladdin, States, and most notably Cobra Records, where he worked with some of Chicago's top blues musicians and developed a reputation as a versatile stylist, capable of adapting to the shifting sounds of R&B, blues, rock & roll, and early soul.

Burrage's chameleon-like approach saw him absorb influences from jazz, blues, and rockabilly, with his vocal style shifting from Amos Milburn-inspired R&B to Little Richard-esque rock & roll and, eventually, gospel-infused soul. He was a prolific session pianist, backing artists such as Magic Sam and Charles Clark, and frequently collaborated with guitarists Otis Rush, Wayne Bennett, and Jody Williams, as well as bass legend Willie Dixon. In the early 1960s, Burrage became a key figure in Chicago's burgeoning soul scene, recording for Vee-Jay and One-derful's M-Pac! subsidiary. His biggest success came in 1965 with 'Got to Find a Way,' which reached number 31 on the US Billboard R&B chart.

Despite limited commercial success, Burrage's influence extended beyond his own recordings. He mentored future soul stars Otis Clay and Tyrone Davis, helping to shape the next generation of Chicago soul. Burrage died suddenly of a heart attack at age 35 in 1966, leaving behind a legacy as a foundational figure in the transition from Chicago blues and R&B to soul.
