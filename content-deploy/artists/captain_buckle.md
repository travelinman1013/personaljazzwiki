## Biography
Captain Buckles is a New Orleans-based band formed by a collective of veteran sidemen who have spent decades backing major national and international acts across the American music scene. The group coalesced into a distinctive unit around 2023, bringing together musicians with deep roots in the Crescent City’s funk, blues, and soul traditions. Their debut full-length album, Hurry Up, was released in November 2025 and showcases their signature blend of funky, rockin’ instrumentals and soulful vocal tracks, all steeped in the groove-heavy legacy of New Orleans. The band’s sound is marked by dynamic subtlety, musical exploration, and a punk-tinged irreverence, drawing inspiration from icons like The Meters, Allman Brothers, and The Band, while forging a style uniquely their own. Captain Buckles’ music is a celebration of their collective experience, community support, and the joy of creating original music on their own terms.
