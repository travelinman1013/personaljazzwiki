## Biography
Joy Clark is a Louisiana-born singer-songwriter and guitarist whose music is a vibrant blend of southern folk, soul, and the rhythms of her New Orleans upbringing. Raised as the youngest of five children in a deeply religious family just outside New Orleans, Clark’s earliest musical experiences were rooted in the church, where she led worship services with her siblings every Sunday in Harvey, Louisiana. Home-schooled for much of her childhood, she was steeped in gospel and hymns, which shaped her vocal style and songwriting, but her journey was also marked by the challenges of growing up as a queer woman in a conservative environment.

Clark’s artistic path took a decisive turn when she attended the University of New Orleans, immersing herself in the city’s legendary music scene and drawing inspiration from its 'do whatcha wanna' spirit. This period of exploration and self-discovery connected her with a diverse community of queer artists, poets, and activists, and exposed her to a wide array of musical influences, including Southern rock, blues, and Americana. Her debut album, 'Tell it to the Wind,' produced by Grammy-nominated Margaret Becker, is both a declaration of independence and a tribute to her roots, blending social consciousness with the soulful traditions of Southeast Louisiana. Clark has since established herself on the national stage, touring with Grammy winner Cyril Neville and performing alongside artists such as Allison Russell, Brandi Carlile, Indigo Girls, and Ani DiFranco.

Clark’s music is celebrated for its introspective lyricism, expressive guitar work, and the way it bridges her personal narrative with broader themes of identity, community, and resilience. As a proud, queer Black woman, she uses her platform to foster connection and hope, making her a distinctive and influential voice in contemporary southern gothic and Americana music.
