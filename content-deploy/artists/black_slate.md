## Biography
Black Slate is a London-based roots reggae and lovers rock band that emerged from the vibrant UK reggae scene in the early 1970s. Formed around 1972–74 by musicians including Anthony Brightly (keyboards, vocals), Chris Hanson (guitar) and Desmond Mahoney (drums), the group drew members from England, Jamaica and Anguilla, reflecting the Caribbean diaspora then reshaping British music.[1][2][3] Originally based in Hackney, East London, they first built a reputation as a formidable live and studio backing band, touring heavily around London and across the UK while supporting leading Jamaican artists such as Delroy Wilson, Ken Boothe and Dennis Brown on their British appearances.[1][3][5] Their exposure to top-tier Jamaican vocalists and producers helped shape a sound that blended roots reggae’s militant pulse with a more melodic, soulful UK sensibility.

By the mid‑1970s Black Slate were releasing their own material, using reggae as a vehicle to document the social and racial tensions of the time. Their first reggae‑chart hit, the 1976 single “Sticks Man,” was an anti‑mugging song inspired by rising racial tensions, media stereotyping of Black communities, and clashes such as the 1976 Notting Hill Carnival disturbances.[1][2][3] They followed with “Mind Your Motion” on their own TCD label in 1979, then broke into the UK mainstream with the Rastafarian rallying call “Amigo,” released via Ensign Records, which reached the UK Top 10 in 1980 and also charted in the Netherlands and Flanders.[1][3][5] Albums including *Sirens in the City* (1980), *Rasta Festival* and *Ogima* (both 1981), *Six Plus One* (1982), *Black Slate* (1985) and later *Get Up and Dance* (1995) showcased a style rooted in one‑drop and steppers rhythms but enriched with lovers rock melodies and conscious, culturally grounded lyrics.[1][3][4] Often described as helping put the British reggae sound on the charts in the 1970s and 80s, Black Slate effectively bridged sound system culture, live band performance, and pop accessibility.[3][4]

After extensive touring, including European runs and a sold‑out tour of New Zealand, the band scaled back their activities in the mid‑1980s as members pursued other paths.[3] However, their catalogue remained influential within UK reggae, and in 2011 original members Brightly, Hanson and Mahoney regrouped, later adding Colin McNeish (bass) and Jesse Brade (vocals) to relaunch Black Slate for a new era.[3] They returned to the stage at events such as the Miami Reggae Festival in 2013 and issued new recordings including the album *Midnight* and the single “World Citizenship,” reaffirming their commitment to using reggae as a vehicle for social commentary and pan‑African consciousness.[3][6] Into the 2010s and 2020s, with projects such as the re‑release of *Peaceful Demonstration* and participation in the documentary *Young, Gifted & Black*, Black Slate have continued to present themselves as UK reggae pioneers whose legacy lies in both their chart success and their sustained engagement with the politics and lived realities of Black Britain.[2][3][6]

## Fun Facts
- Black Slate’s breakthrough single “Sticks Man” was directly inspired by mid‑1970s racial tensions in the UK, including media portrayals of Black youth as “muggers” and the unrest around the 1976 Notting Hill Carnival.
- Their song “Amigo” not only reached the UK Top 10 in 1980 but also became a long‑standing Rastafarian rallying anthem and an underground hit in Antwerp discothèques before breaking into Dutch and Flemish charts.
- Although known for their own hits, Black Slate were initially best known within the industry as a backing band for stars like Ken Boothe and Dennis Brown, building a ‘musicians’ reputation’ before mainstream audiences knew their name.
- After pausing large‑scale touring in the mid‑1980s, the band regrouped decades later and chose the Miami Reggae Festival in 2013 as a key stage for re‑introducing themselves to international audiences.
