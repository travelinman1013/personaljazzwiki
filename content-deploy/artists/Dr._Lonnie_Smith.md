## Biography
Dr. Lonnie Smith (July 3, 1942 – September 28, 2021) was a pioneering American jazz organist renowned for his mastery of the Hammond B-3 organ and his innovative blend of jazz, funk, soul, and blues. Born in Lackawanna, New York, Smith was immersed in music from an early age, influenced by his mother’s gospel singing and the family’s vocal group, which performed on local radio. In his teens, he sang in vocal ensembles—including an early group called the Supremes—and played trumpet before discovering the organ, thanks to the generosity of local music store owner Art Kubera, whom Smith called his 'angel.'[1][2][3][4][7]

Smith’s professional career began in Buffalo’s Pine Grill Jazz Club, where he caught the attention of jazz luminaries like Jack McDuff, Lou Donaldson, and George Benson. He joined Benson’s quartet in the mid-1960s, recording several albums before collaborating with Donaldson on classic Blue Note sessions, including the million-selling 'Alligator Boogaloo.' Smith soon signed with Blue Note as a leader, producing seminal soul jazz albums such as 'Think!,' 'Turning Point,' 'Move Your Hand,' and 'Drives.' Throughout his five-decade career, Smith recorded over 70 albums, worked with a vast array of jazz, blues, and R&B greats, and was celebrated for his genre-defying approach, which included tributes to artists like Jimi Hendrix and the Beatles.[1][2][3][4][8]

Smith’s musical style was marked by deep grooves, bluesy improvisation, and a playful, spiritual energy. He was widely regarded as one of the most creative and influential jazz organists, inspiring generations of musicians and earning accolades such as multiple Jazz Journalists Association awards for Best Organist. His legacy endures in the continued popularity of his recordings and the countless artists he influenced through his innovative artistry and mentorship.[1][2][3][4][5][8]
