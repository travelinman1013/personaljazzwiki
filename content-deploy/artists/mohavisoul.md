## Biography
MohaviSoul is a **San Diego, California–based bluegrass/Americana band** formed in 2012 by mandolinist Randy Hanson and guitarist Mark Miller.[1][2][3] Both songwriters were encouraged by the broader resurgence of acoustic music and set out to blend contemporary bluegrass with Americana in a distinctly West Coast, "Grassicana" style—rooted in tradition but open to modern songwriting and arrangements.[2][3] The band’s name references California’s Mojave Desert, signaling both their Southwestern identity and a certain spacious, cinematic quality in their sound.[6] Over time, MohaviSoul expanded into a five-piece ensemble, developing a repertoire focused on original material that highlights tight vocal harmonies, instrumental interplay, and narrative songwriting.[3][4][9]

Since its founding, MohaviSoul has become a recognized presence on the California bluegrass circuit, appearing at regional festivals and as a showcase band at the IBMA convention, which helped introduce their “California-style contemporary bluegrass-Americana” to a wider audience.[3][5] Their recordings—released through labels such as Mannequin Vanity Records—have drawn praise from bluegrass publications for combining strong original songs with a polished yet energetic band sound.[2][5][6] Though rooted in bluegrass instrumentation, MohaviSoul frequently incorporates broader Americana influences, reflecting both the eclectic musical backgrounds of its members and the multicultural environment of Southern California.[1][3][6] While still a regional act, their awards, reviews, and festival appearances have positioned them as part of the current wave of West Coast bands expanding the stylistic boundaries of modern bluegrass.[3][5][6]
