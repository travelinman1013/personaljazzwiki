## Biography
Shelly Manne, born Sheldon Manne on June 11, 1920, in New York City, grew up immersed in music as the son of renowned drummer Max Manne, who worked at the Roxy Theatre. Initially trying the saxophone, Manne switched to drums at age 18, taking lessons from Billy Gladstone and drawing influence from Jo Jones. He began his professional career in 1940 with Bobby Byrne's orchestra, made his recording debut in 1941 with Joe Marsala, and served in the US Coast Guard Band during World War II, where he sat in at Manhattan jazz clubs. Post-war, he freelanced with Coleman Hawkins, Dizzy Gillespie, Stan Kenton (1946-1952), Woody Herman, and Jazz at the Philharmonic tours alongside Ella Fitzgerald, establishing himself as a first-generation bebopper.[1][2][4][5][6]

In 1952, Manne relocated to Southern California with his wife Florence 'Flip' Butterfield, partly to escape New York's drug scene and pursue interests in music and horses, becoming a founding figure of West Coast jazz. He formed Shelly Manne and His Men, collaborated extensively in Hollywood studios starting with Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window (1954), and worked with composers like Elmer Bernstein, Henry Mancini, and John Williams. Key recordings include the groundbreaking 1956 jazz adaptation of My Fair Lady with André Previn and Leroy Vinnegar, the best-selling jazz album of that year. From 1960 to 1974, he owned the influential nightclub Shelly's Manne-Hole in Hollywood, hosting legends like Tony Williams and Elvin Jones. His style was versatile—spanning cool jazz, bebop, avant-garde, swing, Dixieland, and fusion—known for lyrical, humorous solos and phenomenal technique.[1][2][3][4][5]

Manne appeared on over a thousand recordings, contributed to films like The Man with the Golden Arm and The Gene Krupa Story, and won awards in the horse industry for Standard-Bred Trotters. He died on September 26, 1984, leaving a legacy as one of jazz's most prolific and adaptable drummers, embodying the West Coast sound while refusing stylistic labels.[1][2][3][4]
