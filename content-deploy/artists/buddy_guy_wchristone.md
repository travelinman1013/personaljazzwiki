## Biography
Buddy Guy and Christone "Kingfish" Ingram represent two generations of blues mastery, united by their deep roots in the genre and their shared reverence for the electric guitar. Buddy Guy, born in 1936 in Lettsworth, Louisiana, is a legendary blues guitarist and singer whose career began in the 1950s and whose influence has shaped the sound of Chicago blues and beyond. Known for his fiery guitar playing, passionate vocals, and electrifying stage presence, Guy has played alongside icons such as Muddy Waters, Junior Wells, and Eric Clapton. His innovative approach to the blues, blending traditional forms with rock and soul, has earned him multiple Grammy Awards and a place in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

Christone "Kingfish" Ingram, born in 1999 in Clarksdale, Mississippi, emerged as a prodigious talent in his teens, quickly gaining recognition for his virtuosic guitar skills and soulful voice. Raised in the heart of the Delta, Ingram was steeped in gospel and blues from an early age, studying at the Delta Blues Museum’s Arts and Education Program. He released his debut album, 'Kingfish,' in 2019, earning a Grammy nomination, and followed it with the Grammy-winning '662' in 2022. Ingram's playing channels the spirit of blues legends while infusing modern sensibilities, positioning him as a torchbearer for the next generation of blues musicians.

Their collaboration, showcased in performances such as the Strat Sessions and at Buddy Guy’s Legends club in Chicago, symbolizes the enduring legacy and evolving future of the blues. Guy’s mentorship and endorsement of Kingfish have provided a powerful bridge between eras, with both artists celebrating the expressive power of the blues and the iconic Fender Stratocaster guitar.
