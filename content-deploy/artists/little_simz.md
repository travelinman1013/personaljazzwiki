## Biography
Simbiatu "Simbi" Abisola Abiola Ajikawo, known professionally as Little Simz, was born on February 23, 1994, in Islington, London. Raised in a Nigerian family, she developed an early passion for music and performance, attending Highbury Fields School and participating in St Mary's Youth Club, a nurturing ground for several British pop talents. Simz began recording music as a teenager, producing her first mixtape, 'Stratosphere,' at age 16, and quickly gained attention for her lyrical prowess and self-produced tracks. 

Her career accelerated with the independent release of her first three albums: 'A Curious Tale of Trials + Persons' (2015), 'Stillness in Wonderland' (2016), and 'Grey Area' (2019), the latter earning critical acclaim and multiple awards, including the Ivor Novello and NME Awards for Best Album. Simz's fourth album, 'Sometimes I Might Be Introvert' (2021), was widely hailed as one of the year's best, winning the 2022 Mercury Prize and Brit Award for Best New Artist. Throughout her journey, she has remained fiercely independent, releasing music through her own label, Age 101, and blending rap with influences from grime, reggae, blues, synth-rock, and jazzy R&B. 

Beyond music, Little Simz is also an accomplished actress, with roles in television series such as 'Top Boy.' Her artistry is marked by introspective storytelling, innovative production, and a commitment to authenticity, making her a leading figure in contemporary British hip-hop and a source of inspiration for a new generation of artists.
