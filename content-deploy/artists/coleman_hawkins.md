## Biography
Coleman Randolph Hawkins, born November 21, 1904, in St. Joseph, Missouri, is widely regarded as the first great tenor saxophonist in jazz. Raised in a musically supportive family, Hawkins began with piano and cello before switching to tenor saxophone by age nine, a time when the instrument was barely recognized in jazz. By his teens, he was already performing professionally, joining Mamie Smith’s Jazz Hounds in 1921 and making his recording debut soon after. In the 1920s and 1930s, Hawkins rose to prominence as a member of Fletcher Henderson’s orchestra, where he helped establish the tenor sax as a leading jazz voice, developing a rich, vibrato-laden tone and a virtuosic, arpeggiated improvisational style that set him apart from his contemporaries.

Hawkins’s career spanned several eras of jazz, from swing to bebop and beyond. After leaving Henderson’s band, he spent much of the 1930s in Europe, returning to the U.S. in 1939 to record his landmark version of 'Body and Soul,' which showcased his advanced harmonic approach and improvisational prowess. In the 1940s, Hawkins embraced the emerging bebop movement, collaborating with younger musicians such as Thelonious Monk and Max Roach, and remained musically adventurous throughout his life. Even as jazz styles evolved, Hawkins adapted, recording with figures from Duke Ellington to John Coltrane, and influencing generations of saxophonists. He died on May 19, 1969, leaving a legacy as a pioneering force who redefined the possibilities of the tenor saxophone in jazz.
