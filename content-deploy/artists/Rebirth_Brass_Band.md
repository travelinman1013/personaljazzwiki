## Biography
Rebirth Brass Band is a pioneering New Orleans brass ensemble formed in 1983 by brothers Philip and Keith Frazier and trumpeter Kermit Ruffins, all students at Joseph S. Clark Senior High School in the historic Treme neighborhood. The group emerged from the vibrant marching band tradition of New Orleans, initially performing classic brass band repertoire on the streets and in Jackson Square, before quickly developing a reputation for their energetic blend of tradition and innovation. Their early gigs included street performances for tips and a formative weekly residency at the Glass House, which helped cement their local following.

Rebirth Brass Band distinguished themselves by incorporating elements of funk, R&B, hip hop, and contemporary rhythm and blues into the brass band format, setting a new standard for the genre and influencing countless younger musicians. Their debut album, 'Here to Stay' (1984), was recorded in the Treme neighborhood and marked the beginning of a prolific recording career, with over fifteen albums released. The band is known for their electrifying live shows, especially their legendary Tuesday night residency at the Maple Leaf Bar and their participation in New Orleans' second line parades. In 2012, they won a Grammy Award for Best Regional Roots Music Album for 'Rebirth of New Orleans,' solidifying their legacy as innovators and ambassadors of New Orleans music.

Over four decades, Rebirth Brass Band has become a cornerstone of the New Orleans music scene, celebrated for both their musical excellence and their commitment to community traditions. Their influence extends internationally through tours and festival appearances, as well as through media features such as HBO's 'Treme.' Despite their global acclaim, the band remains deeply rooted in the local culture, continuing to inspire new generations of brass musicians and keeping the spirit of New Orleans street music alive.
