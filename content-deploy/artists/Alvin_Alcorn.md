## Biography
Alvin Elmore Alcorn was born on September 7, 1912, in New Orleans, Louisiana, a city renowned for its vibrant jazz tradition. He learned music theory from his older brother Oliver, a saxophonist and clarinetist, and later studied trumpet with George McCullum Jr. By the late 1920s, Alcorn was already performing with local bands, including Clarence Desdune’s ensemble, and soon became a member of Armand J. Piron's Sunny South Syncopators. His early exposure to the New Orleans jazz scene shaped his distinctive style, rooted in the classic Dixieland tradition.

Alcorn's career spanned over six decades, during which he played with many of the leading figures in New Orleans jazz. In the 1930s, he toured with Don Albert’s swing band and, after returning to New Orleans, worked with Paul Barbarin, Sidney Desvigne, Oscar Celestin, and Octave Crosby. After serving in the army during World War II, Alcorn briefly joined Tab Smith and Alphonse Picou. In the 1950s, he moved to Los Angeles to join Kid Ory’s Creole Jazz Band, appearing in the film 'The Benny Goodman Story' and touring Europe. He later returned to New Orleans, performing with the Olympia Brass Band and Louis Cottrell Jr.’s Heritage Hall Jazz Band, and continued to tour internationally into the 1980s.

Alcorn was celebrated for his warm, lyrical trumpet tone and his mastery of the New Orleans jazz idiom. His legacy endures through his recordings, his contributions to the preservation of traditional jazz, and his influence on subsequent generations of musicians. He remained an active and respected figure in the New Orleans music community until his death on July 10, 2003.
