## Biography
Andy Kirk and His Twelve Clouds of Joy was a pioneering swing and big band ensemble led by Andrew Dewey Kirk, an American jazz bandleader and saxophonist born on May 28, 1898, in Newport, Kentucky. Raised in Denver, Colorado, Kirk received early musical instruction from Wilberforce Whiteman, the father of famed bandleader Paul Whiteman. Kirk began his professional career as a bass saxophonist and tuba player with George Morrison's band before joining Terrence Holder's Dark Clouds of Joy in Dallas in 1925. When Holder departed in 1929, Kirk was elected leader, relocated the group to Kansas City, and renamed it the Twelve Clouds of Joy.

Under Kirk's leadership, the band became a central force in the Kansas City jazz scene, performing at venues like the Pla-Mor Ballroom and Paseo Hall. The Twelve Clouds of Joy gained national recognition after their first recordings for Brunswick Records in 1929–1930, with pianist and arranger Mary Lou Williams joining the band and quickly becoming its creative heart. The group epitomized the Kansas City swing style, known for its rhythmic drive and blues-infused arrangements. The band recorded prolifically for Decca Records from 1936 to 1946, producing hits such as "Until The Real Thing Comes Along" and launching the careers of several jazz luminaries.

Kirk was known for his leadership and ability to showcase the talents of his musicians rather than for solo performances. The band disbanded in 1948, after which Kirk pursued careers in real estate and as a musicians' union official. His legacy endures through the musicians he mentored and the innovative sound he helped popularize, making the Twelve Clouds of Joy a cornerstone of the swing era.
