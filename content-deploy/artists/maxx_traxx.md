# Maxx Traxx

## Quick Info
- **Genres**: post-disco, boogie
- **Spotify Popularity**: 13/100
- **Followers**: 713
- **Origin**: Chicago, Illinois, United States

## Biography
Maxx Traxx was a short‑lived but highly regarded **Chicago** soul‑funk and post‑disco band active at the turn of the 1980s, evolving out of an earlier group called **Third Rail**.[1][4][5] Centered around keyboardist and songwriter **Terry Marshall**, the band emerged from Chicago’s vibrant club scene, gigging relentlessly “five‑plus nights a week” across the 312 area and building a reputation as a powerful live act that could move seamlessly from jazz and fusion to funk, rock, and R&B covers before focusing on their own material.[1][4] In 1982 they recorded two albums: *Third Rail: Reachin’ For It*, self‑released on their own Two‑Twenty‑Two label under the Third Rail name, and *Maxx Traxx*, issued by Pulse Records, capturing their progressive soul‑jazz and boogie sound at its peak.[1] 

Musically, Maxx Traxx fused **Minneapolis‑style funk‑rock**, jazz harmony, and Chicago soul into a synth‑heavy, groove‑driven style that in hindsight sits squarely in the post‑disco **boogie** continuum.[1][3] The arrival of bassist **J.D. Gatlin** brought a pronounced Minneapolis funk influence linked to the earlier Prophets of Peace scene that fed into Prince’s circle, helping shape the band’s hybrid of funk, soul, and jazz.[1] By the early 1980s they had transitioned from a cover band to one whose sets were predominantly original, workshopped nightly on stage, and they shared bills with major acts such as **Kool & the Gang** and later opened for the **Commodores** at the Holiday Star Theatre in 1983.[1] Despite strong material and a commanding live presence, the group dissolved around 1983, a mere four years after its start, as members pursued other musical paths or stepped away from performance.[1] 

In the decades following their breakup, Maxx Traxx’s recordings—especially tracks like **“Don’t Touch It”**—became highly prized among collectors, described as a “certified grail” for its synth‑heavy jazz‑funk/boogie crossover sound and rediscovered through reissues by archival labels such as the Numero Group.[1][3][4] Retrospective coverage has reframed Maxx Traxx as an important if under‑recognized link in Chicago’s post‑disco and modern soul lineage, a band that encapsulated the city’s club‑driven R&B and funk scene at the dawn of the 1980s while anticipating the deeper, more electronic strains of boogie and modern funk that later DJs and producers would champion.[1][3][4] Their music now functions as both a snapshot of an intensely creative but localized Chicago scene and a resource for contemporary artists and DJs seeking authentic, groove‑rich material from that era.[1][3][6]

## Fun Facts
- Before Maxx Traxx, keyboardist Terry Marshall had already built a professional résumé playing with renowned Chicago soul group the Emotions, connecting the band directly to the classic 1970s Chicago soul scene.[1]
- Drummer Malcom Banks joined only in mid‑1982, just before the Third Rail name change to Maxx Traxx, yet still managed to appear on the band’s signature *Maxx Traxx* album and had previously toured with both the Emotions and the Dells.[1]
- Bassist J.D. Gatlin’s background in the Minneapolis funk‑rock sound—traced back to the Prophets of Peace, whose guitarist later worked with Prince—gave Maxx Traxx a distinctive hybrid of Minneapolis funk, jazz, and Chicago soul.[1]
- Maxx Traxx’s track “Don’t Touch It” later became a highly sought‑after collector’s item, described as a “certified grail” for boogie and jazz‑funk enthusiasts and reissued alongside a version by Rotterdam band Another Taste.[3]
