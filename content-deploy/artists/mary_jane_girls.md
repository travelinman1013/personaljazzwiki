## Biography
The Mary Jane Girls were an American R&B, soul, funk, and disco group formed in Los Angeles, California in 1979 as a creative project by producer and singer Rick James.[1] The group originated when James was working with Joanne 'JoJo' McDuffie, a backup vocalist who had supported him on several tours, along with session vocalists known as the Water Sisters. James developed tracks with these vocalists to create the distinctive "Mary Jane Girls" sound, and when Motown Records offered James a contract believing he had assembled a girl group, he accepted the deal and formalized the Mary Jane Girls as an official group rather than McDuffie's solo project.[1] The primary lineup consisted of Joanne 'JoJo' McDuffie, Kimberly 'Maxi' Wuletich, Candice 'Candi' Ghant, and Cheryl 'Cheri' Wells Bailey, with Yvette 'Corvette' Marine later replacing Bailey.[1]

The group achieved commercial success throughout the 1980s with their self-titled debut album released in 1983, which reached #56 on the Billboard 200 and #6 on the Top Hip-Hop/R&B charts, spawning four charting singles including "Candy Man," "All Night Long," "Boys," and "Jealousy."[1] Their sophomore album "Only Four You" (1985) proved even more successful, featuring the hit single "In My House," which became their biggest chart success, reaching #7 on the Billboard 200 and helping the album achieve gold status.[1][2] Despite their musical talent and vocal capabilities, the group struggled against their carefully cultivated image as attractive performers, with members like McDuffie working to establish themselves as serious singers rather than merely visual attractions.[2] The group's final single, "Walk Like a Man"—a cover of The Four Seasons' classic featured on the "A Fine Mess" soundtrack—reached #41 on the Billboard 200.[1] The Mary Jane Girls disbanded in 1987 following Rick James' falling out with Motown Records.[1]

## Fun Facts
- Contrary to popular belief, the group's name was not derived from marijuana slang; Rick James stated the name came from a candy called Mary Janes because 'the girls are as sweet as candy,' though this explanation contradicts the commonly believed alternate origin story.[2]
- The Mary Jane Girls were essentially a constructed group where Rick James created four distinct personas for each member: 'JoJo' as the powerful woman image, 'Candi' as the sophisticated vamp, 'Corvette' as the young wild member, and 'Maxi' as the leather queen.[2]
- McDuffie sang lead and background vocals on all Mary Jane Girls recordings, while the Water Sisters provided additional vocals on the recordings, but the full band performed live with McDuffie on tour—a behind-the-scenes arrangement that was not widely known to the public.[1]
- The only song recorded by the Mary Jane Girls not composed by Rick James was 'Walk Like a Man,' a cover of The Four Seasons' classic that became their final single.[1]
