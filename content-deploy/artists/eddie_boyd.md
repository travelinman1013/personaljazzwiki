## Biography
Edward Riley Boyd (November 25, 1914 – July 13, 1994) was an American blues pianist, singer, and songwriter born on Frank Moore's Plantation near Stovall, Mississippi. He was childhood friends with Muddy Waters and learned to play both guitar and piano, with his piano style influenced by Roosevelt Sykes and Leroy Carr. Boyd moved to Memphis's Beale Street district in 1936, where he performed with his group the Dixie Rhythm Boys before joining the Great Migration to Chicago in 1941, where he recorded as an accompanist for prominent blues musicians including Muddy Waters, Sonny Boy Williamson, and Tampa Red.

Boyd achieved his greatest commercial success in the early 1950s after deciding to produce his own recordings. In May 1952, he recorded "Five Long Years" for J.O.B. Records, which became a massive hit, topping the Billboard R&B chart for seven weeks. He followed this success with two further R&B chart hits for Chess Records in 1953: "24 Hours" and "Third Degree" (co-written with Willie Dixon), both reaching number three on the R&B chart. An automobile accident in 1957 temporarily halted his career momentum, but he continued performing and touring with notable artists including Buddy Guy, Fleetwood Mac, and John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers throughout the 1960s.

Facing persistent racial discrimination in the United States, Boyd relocated to Belgium to record with the Dutch band Cuby and the Blizzards before settling in Helsinki, Finland in 1970, where he remained for the final 24 years of his life. In Finland, he recorded ten blues albums, beginning with "Praise to Helsinki" (1970), and married his wife Leila in 1977. Boyd died at Meilahti Hospital in Helsinki in 1994 and was buried in St. Lawrence Church's cemetery in Vantaa. His legacy was reinforced when Eric Clapton's chart-topping 1994 blues album "From the Cradle" included interpretations of Boyd's "Five Long Years" and "Third Degree."
