## Biography
Luca Fogale is a Canadian singer-songwriter from Burnaby, British Columbia, just outside Vancouver, known for his intimate, piano‑driven pop and folk‑inflected songwriting.[1][2][5][8] Raised in a Catholic household, he initially found his sense of reverence in the church before gradually turning that focus inward, channeling it into a deep exploration of the human spirit, gratitude, and personal faith that now underpins much of his work.[5] He learned piano first and later guitar, and while he spent two years studying psychology at the University of British Columbia, he ultimately left school and his job when songwriting became an emotional necessity rather than a hobby.[3][4] That decision led him to dedicate himself fully to music, finding fulfillment in writing and performing that formal studies could not provide.[3][4]

Fogale’s career began to gain national traction after he competed in Vancouver radio station The Peak’s Peak Performance Project in 2013, a high‑profile artist development contest that put emerging musicians in front of larger audiences.[1] He released his debut album *Safety* in 2016, followed by the singles “I Don’t Want to Lose You” (2017) and “What I Came Here For” (2018), the latter inspired by his grandmother’s memory of surviving a World War II bombing in Italy.[1][4] His breakthrough came with the 2020 album *Nothing Is Lost*, a meticulously crafted collection written over several years and refined during the COVID‑19 pandemic as he sought to address broader social and personal themes.[1][2] The album earned a Juno Award nomination for Adult Contemporary Album of the Year in 2022 and significantly expanded his international audience, with tens of millions of streams and prominent playlist placements.[1][2]

Fogale followed *Nothing Is Lost* with *Run Where the Light Calls* in 2023, which brought him a second Juno nomination for Adult Contemporary Album of the Year at the 2024 Juno Awards, cementing his reputation as a leading voice in contemporary Canadian singer‑songwriting.[1][5] His music—often written at his 1974 Yamaha upright piano in his Burnaby basement studio—is characterized by soft, whispered vocals, careful lyrical intention, and unadorned arrangements that prioritize emotional clarity over studio gloss.[2][5] He has toured extensively across Canada, the United States, Europe, Australia, and Japan, offering concerts that emphasize intimacy and connection, and he frequently collaborates with other songwriters in his home studio.[2] Across his catalog, Fogale’s work functions as a kind of sanctuary music, offering comfort and empathy to listeners facing both external hardships and inner struggles.[5][7][8]

## Fun Facts
- Fogale writes most days at a 1974 Yamaha upright piano in the basement of his Burnaby home, which he bought about a decade ago and affectionately calls his “little old friend.”[2]
- Before committing to music, he spent two years studying psychology at the University of British Columbia but left both school and his job when he realized songwriting was the only thing that made him feel fulfilled.[3][4]
- The song “What I Came Here For” was inspired by his grandmother’s story of surviving a bombing in Italy during World War II, blending family history with his reflective lyricism.[4]
- He was raised Catholic and originally directed his sense of reverence toward religion, but as an adult he has redirected that impulse inward, treating songwriting as a means of exploring faith, gratitude, and the human spirit.[5]
