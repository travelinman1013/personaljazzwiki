## Biography
The Donna Jean Godchaux Band with Jeff Mattson was an American rock group formed in 2007, originally under the name Kettle Joe’s Psychedelic Swamp Revue before evolving into Donna Jean and the Tricksters and finally adopting its best-known moniker in 2009. The band was founded by Donna Jean Godchaux-MacKay, renowned for her tenure as vocalist with the Grateful Dead, and Jeff Mattson, a respected guitarist and songwriter from the jam band Zen Tricksters. Their collaboration brought together Donna Jean’s soulful, Muscle Shoals-trained vocals and Mattson’s versatile guitar work, blending rock, country, folk, and psychedelia into a distinctive sound[1][3][7].

Donna Jean, born in Muscle Shoals, Alabama, began her career as a session vocalist at Fame Studios and Muscle Shoals Sound Studios, contributing to recordings with legendary artists including Elvis Presley before joining the Grateful Dead in the 1970s[1][8]. Jeff Mattson, raised on Long Island, New York, emerged as a founding member of the Zen Tricksters, later joining the Donna Jean Godchaux Band and becoming the lead guitarist for Dark Star Orchestra in 2009[2][4]. The band released several albums, including 'Donna Jean and the Tricksters' (2008) and 'Back Around' (2014), and was known for its stripped-down arrangements compared to larger jam ensembles[3][6].

The band’s legacy is rooted in its fusion of classic rock influences and improvisational jam traditions, drawing inspiration from artists such as the Allman Brothers Band, The Band, Janis Joplin, and Jefferson Airplane. Donna Jean’s induction into both the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Alabama Music Hall of Fame underscores her impact on American music, while the group’s collaborative spirit and live performances continued to resonate with Deadheads and jam band fans until its disbandment in 2025 following Donna Jean’s death[1][3].
