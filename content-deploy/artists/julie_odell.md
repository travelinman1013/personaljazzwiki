## Biography
Julie Odell is a New Orleans-based singer-songwriter whose music is characterized by folky, dreamy, and soulful textures, marked by her powerful and distinctive vocals. Born into an artistic family—her mother a painter and her father a potter—Odell spent much of her childhood traveling to art festivals and craft fairs, absorbing a creative spirit that would later infuse her music. Although she once dreamed of becoming a meteorologist, she gravitated toward the arts, starting with writing and performing 'dainty piano waltzes' on her family's upright piano during her youth[1][4].

Odell began performing at open mic nights and quickly became known for her piano-driven ballads, reminiscent of artists like Regina Spektor and Fiona Apple. As her career developed, she formed the psychedelic folk-rock band Giant Cloud, which toured extensively and released an album before she transitioned to performing under her own name. Her solo work is noted for its dynamic range, shifting between chaotic, fast-paced passages and delicate, quiet moments—a reflection of her fascination with musical dynamics and emotional contrasts[1][2].

Her debut album, 'Autumn Eve,' and subsequent releases like the EP 'Disappearing Act,' showcase her ability to blend earthy, grounded songwriting with experimental textures. Odell's music often draws from personal experiences, including mental health struggles, and she is recognized for creating immersive live performances that foster a deep connection with her audience. Her legacy is one of constant transformation and artistic exploration, rooted in the vibrant cultural landscape of New Orleans[4][5][6].
