## Biography
George Freeman (April 10, 1927 – April 1, 2025) was an American jazz guitarist and recording artist born in Chicago, Illinois, who became a pioneering figure in bebop guitar and a mainstay of the Chicago jazz scene for over seven decades. Freeman's musical journey began in his teenage years when he was inspired after sneaking into the Rhumboogie Café in Hyde Park to hear blues legend T-Bone Walker perform, an experience that sparked his passion for the guitar. He quickly became one of the first jazz guitarists to champion Charlie Parker's bebop style, studying under the exacting pedagogue Walter Dyett at DuSable High School and performing with Eugene Wright's Dukes of Swing before forming his own bebop band by 1946—Chicago's first modern-jazz bebop ensemble.

Freeman's career trajectory took him from Chicago to New York in 1947, where he joined the Joe Morris Orchestra alongside his high school friend Johnny Griffin, making his first recordings on the Manor and Atlantic labels. His extended solo on "Boogie Woogie Joe" (1947) has been described as "the first scintillating guitar workout in rock history." Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, Freeman established himself as a versatile musician, performing with Charlie Parker at the Pershing Hotel in the early 1950s and later collaborating with soul and R&B artists including Jackie Wilson, organists Wild Bill Davis and Richard "Groove" Holmes, and saxophonist Gene Ammons, with whom he performed from 1969 until Ammons' death in 1974. After returning to Chicago in the 1970s, Freeman recorded his first albums under his own name, including "Introducing George Freeman Live" (1971), "Birth Sign" (1972), and later "Rebellion" (1995), establishing a prolific recording career that spanned nearly three decades.

Freeman experienced a remarkable late-career renaissance following his brother Von Freeman's death in 2012, when Chicago's jazz community rallied to support him. This led to increased bookings and performances, earning him the Chicago Tribune's 2014 Chicagoan of the Year in Jazz award. Known for his sophisticated technique, sophisticated bebop-influenced style, and ability to blend swing, blues, and horn-player inspired phrasing, Freeman remained an active performer well into his 90s, becoming one of the world's oldest active jazz musicians. He passed away on April 1, 2025, just nine days before his 98th birthday, leaving behind a legacy as a bridge between bebop's revolutionary era and contemporary jazz.

## Fun Facts
- Freeman snuck into the Rhumboogie Café through a stage door as a teenager to hear T-Bone Walker perform, since he was too young to legally enter the club—this unauthorized visit sparked his lifelong passion for guitar.
- His extended solo on 'Boogie Woogie Joe' (1947) has been described as 'the first scintillating guitar workout in rock history,' yet Freeman unjustly missed out on a compositional credit for the band's first hit 'Lowe Groovin'' and quit in protest.
- Freeman was occasionally booted from Walter Dyett's exacting band class at DuSable High School but was later invited by Dyett to join his swing orchestra at the same Rhumboogie Café where Freeman had first fallen in love with the guitar.
- After his brother Von Freeman's death in 2012, Chicago's jazz community actively intervened to support the then-85-year-old George, setting him up with guitarist Mike Allemana for a residency that sparked a remarkable late-career renaissance, leading to his 2014 Chicago Tribune Chicagoan of the Year in Jazz award.
