## Biography
The Budos Band is an instrumental ensemble formed in Staten Island, New York, in 2005, known for their unique fusion of Afrobeat, jazz funk, soul, and retro rock influences. The group originated from a core of musicians who met as youths in an after-school jazz ensemble at the Richmond Ave. Community Center. Their shared passion for soul and Afrobeat led them to late-night Manhattan gigs, where they absorbed the sounds of acts like Antibalas and Sharon Jones & the Dap-Kings. After leaving the Community Center to pursue their own musical direction, they evolved from Los Barbudos to The Budos Band, recruiting additional horn players from Brooklyn and solidifying their lineup.

Signed to Daptone Records after impressing an A&R representative with their distinctive sound, The Budos Band released their self-titled debut in 2005, followed by a series of albums that showcased their evolving style. Their music, described as 'doom rock Afro-soul' and 'Afro-soul inspired by Ethiopian music,' incorporates elements from 1970s jazz, funk, Afrobeat, hard rock, and proto-metal. Over two decades, they have built a reputation for thunderous, cinematic instrumentals and raucous live performances across four continents. The band's legacy is marked by their ability to blend diverse genres while maintaining a cohesive and instantly recognizable sound.
