## Biography
Belton Richard (October 5, 1939 – June 21, 2017) was an American Cajun accordionist and vocalist born in Rayne, Louisiana, celebrated as one of the most influential figures in modern Cajun music.[2][6] Richard learned the accordion at his father's knee during his childhood, though sources differ on whether he began at age five or seven.[1] During his teenage years, he was drawn to rock and roll, but his Cajun heritage ultimately prevailed, leading him to establish the Musical Aces in 1959.[1] The group became a pioneering force in Cajun music, credited as possibly the first Cajun outfit to employ the electric bass, modernizing the traditional sound.[1]

Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Richard's dancehall band achieved significant popularity, and he became a prolific songwriter whose compositions have endured for decades.[1][4] He scored several regional hits with his original compositions, including "Un Autre Soir Ennuyant" (based on Jimmy Clanton's "Another Sleepless Night") and "Le Paradis des Musiciens."[1] Richard also recorded French-language covers of popular songs such as "The Streak" and "Behind Closed Doors," demonstrating his versatility as an artist.[1] Known for his distinctive rich baritone vocal range, Richard remained open to musical innovation, as evidenced by his 1993 album "Modern Sounds in Cajun Music."[1]

Richard officially retired in 1987 but returned to recording in 1996 with the album "I'm Back," released by Swallow Records.[1] In 1997, he was inducted into the Cajun Music Hall of Fame as one of its first honorees, and he received the Signature Award from the Rayne-Acadia Parish Hall of Honor in 2000.[1] Though he did not perform as frequently in his later years, the songs he penned decades earlier remained staples in the Cajun music repertoire, routinely performed by contemporary musical outfits.[1] Richard passed away on June 21, 2017, at the age of 77, leaving behind a legacy as a cornerstone of modern Cajun music.
