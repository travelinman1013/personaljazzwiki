## Biography
David Charles Lowery, born September 10, 1960 in San Antonio, Texas, is an influential American musician, songwriter, producer, and activist best known as the founder and frontman of the alternative rock band Camper Van Beethoven and the co-founder of the alt-country group Cracker. Raised in a military family, Lowery's early years were marked by frequent moves before his family settled in Redlands, California. He attended UC Santa Cruz, where he began playing in bands such as Sitting Ducks and Box O’ Laughs, eventually forming Camper Van Beethoven in 1983. The band quickly became known for their eclectic blend of folk, punk, ska, and world music, producing college radio staples like “Take the Skinheads Bowling” and “The Day That Lassie Went to the Moon.”

After Camper Van Beethoven's initial breakup in 1990, Lowery teamed up with guitarist Johnny Hickman to form Cracker, a band that fused rock with country influences and helped define the burgeoning alt-country scene of the early 1990s. Cracker achieved mainstream success with hits such as “Teen Angst (What the World Needs Now)” and “Low,” earning platinum and gold records while maintaining a reputation for sharp songwriting and genre-blending innovation. Both Camper Van Beethoven and Cracker have continued to record and tour, with Lowery also pursuing solo projects, including the autobiographical album 'Fathers, Sons and Brothers,' which reflects on his four-decade journey through music and personal history.

Lowery’s musical style is characterized by its wit, eclecticism, and willingness to defy genre conventions, moving fluidly between absurdist indie rock, alt-country, and Americana. Beyond his work as a performer, he is recognized as a producer, studio owner, educator, and a leading advocate for artists’ rights in the digital age, notably spearheading a successful lawsuit against Spotify. His enduring impact on indie and alternative music is marked by a legacy of innovation, collaboration, and advocacy.
