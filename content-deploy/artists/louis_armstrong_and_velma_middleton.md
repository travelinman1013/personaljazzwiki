## Biography
Louis Armstrong & Velma Middleton formed one of jazz’s most beloved stage partnerships, marked by humor, warmth, and musical chemistry. Velma Middleton, born September 1, 1917, in Holdenville, Oklahoma, began her career as a chorus girl and dancer, later working as a solo act and touring South America with Connie McLean’s Rhythm Orchestra. In 1942, she joined Louis Armstrong’s big band, quickly becoming an integral part of his performances. When Armstrong’s orchestra disbanded in 1947, Middleton continued with his smaller group, the All-Stars, remaining a fixture until her death in 1961[2][1][4].

Middleton’s stage presence was characterized by her comic duets with Armstrong—such as “That’s My Desire” and “Baby, It’s Cold Outside”—and her acrobatic splits, which delighted audiences worldwide. While critics often dismissed her vocal abilities, Armstrong valued her as a key member of his ensemble, describing her as family. Middleton’s contributions are preserved on seminal Armstrong albums like 'Louis Armstrong Plays W.C. Handy' and 'Satch Plays Fats.' She died in Freetown, Sierra Leone, in 1961 after suffering a stroke while on tour with Armstrong, marking the end of a nearly two-decade collaboration that left a lasting impression on jazz performance[2][3][4].

Their musical style blended Armstrong’s virtuosic trumpet and gravelly vocals with Middleton’s good-humored singing and stage antics, creating a dynamic that was both musically engaging and theatrically entertaining. Together, they helped bring jazz to international audiences, influencing the genre’s presentation and broadening its appeal far beyond the United States[2][3].
