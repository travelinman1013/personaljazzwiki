## Biography
Coletivo Samba Noir is a Brazilian group formed in Rio de Janeiro in 2014, built around singer, actress, dancer, guitarist, and composer **Katia B (Katia Bronstein)** and guitarist/arranger **Luís Filipe de Lima**.[4][6] Drawing on Rio’s deep samba tradition, the ensemble was conceived as a project that filters classic and contemporary samba through a darker, more atmospheric, and cinematic lens suggested by the word *noir* in its name.[4][6] The group’s work places Katia B’s voice and songwriting in dialogue with de Lima’s refined harmonic language and arrangements, connecting the lineage of Rio samba to a more experimental, urban sensibility.

From its inception, Coletivo Samba Noir has focused on re‑imagining samba rather than simply reproducing canonical forms, emphasizing texture, mood, and sophisticated guitar‑driven arrangements.[4][6] While detailed discographical and performance histories are scarce in publicly available sources, the group has been noted in Brazilian‑music specialist media as part of a contemporary wave of artists renewing samba with jazz‑tinged harmony and a strong authorial presence.[6] Situated in Rio de Janeiro—the historical cradle of urban samba—the collective’s legacy to date lies in its contribution to this ongoing modern reinterpretation of samba, maintaining fidelity to the genre’s rhythmic core while exploring more introspective, nocturnal aesthetics.

Given the extremely limited documentation currently accessible, further specifics on early individual careers, complete line‑ups beyond the two named founders, and a full release chronology cannot be verified from reliable sources and therefore are not included here.
