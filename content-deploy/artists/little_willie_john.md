## Biography
William Edward 'Little Willie' John was born on November 15, 1937, in Cullendale, Arkansas, and moved with his family to Detroit, Michigan, in 1942. Raised in a musical household—his mother sang gospel and played guitar—John began performing in a family gospel quintet and quickly gained notice for his powerful, emotive tenor voice. By his teens, he was singing at amateur shows and briefly joined the Paul 'Hucklebuck' Williams orchestra before being discovered by producer Henry Glover, who signed him to King Records in 1955 when John was just seventeen.[5][1]

John's career soared in the late 1950s and early 1960s, marked by a string of R&B and pop hits including 'All Around the World,' 'Need Your Love So Bad,' 'Talk to Me, Talk to Me,' 'Sleep,' and most famously, 'Fever' (1956), which became a standard and sold over a million copies.[3][4][2] His dynamic stage presence, sharp dress, and smooth delivery made him a favorite on the R&B circuit, and his recordings crossed over to mainstream audiences. Despite his success, John struggled with alcoholism and personal insecurities, leading to erratic behavior and eventually a decline in sales and his contract with King Records.[5][3]

Tragically, John's life was cut short when he was convicted of manslaughter in 1966 and died in Washington State Penitentiary on May 26, 1968, at age 30. His legacy endures as a pioneer of soul and R&B, influencing generations of artists and earning posthumous honors including induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame (1996), the Blues Hall of Fame (2022), and the Michigan Rock & Roll Legends Hall of Fame (2016).[1][3][4]
