## Biography
George Lewis (born Joseph Louis Francois Zenon, July 13, 1900 – December 31, 1968) was a pioneering American jazz clarinetist, arranger, and bandleader, best known for his central role in the New Orleans traditional jazz revival. Born in the French Quarter of New Orleans, Louisiana, Lewis came from a family with deep roots in the region; his maternal great-great-grandmother was a Senegalese slave brought to Louisiana around 1803, and his mother, Alice Zeno, worked as a domestic servant for author Grace King[1][2][3]. Lewis was largely self-taught, beginning with a tin fife before switching to clarinet, and by his late teens, he was already performing professionally with local bands such as the Black Eagle Band of Mandeville and Buddy Petit’s Black and Tan Band[2]. Despite the challenges of the Great Depression, which forced him to work as a stevedore to make ends meet, Lewis continued to play music whenever possible, often with little sleep[1][3].

Lewis's career took a significant turn in 1942 when jazz historian Bill Russell came to New Orleans to record trumpeter Bunk Johnson, who chose Lewis as his clarinetist. This led to Lewis's first recordings as a leader on American Music Records, a label dedicated to preserving the work of older New Orleans musicians[1][2]. After a serious injury in 1944, Lewis convalesced at home, where informal sessions with friends produced his signature piece, 'Burgundy Street Blues'[2][3]. By the late 1940s and 1950s, Lewis had become a major figure in the New Orleans jazz revival, leading his own bands and touring internationally, including performances in Europe and Japan[2]. In his later years, he was a regular at Preservation Hall in New Orleans, leading the [[01_Projects/PersonalArtistWiki/Artists/Preservation_Hall_Jazz_Band]] until shortly before his death in 1968[3]. Lewis’s playing was marked by a distinctive, emotive tone and a deep connection to the collective improvisational spirit of early New Orleans jazz, earning him a lasting legacy as a keeper of the tradition.

## Fun Facts
- George Lewis's signature tune, 'Burgundy Street Blues,' was reportedly composed during informal bedside jam sessions while he was recovering from a serious stevedore accident in 1944[2][3].
- Lewis was so revered in Japan that a club dedicated entirely to him existed there, with every picture and record in the venue featuring him[2].
- Despite achieving international fame, Lewis remained deeply rooted in New Orleans, rarely traveling far from the city in his early career[1].
- Lewis was known for giving many young musicians their first break in the New Orleans jazz scene, fostering the next generation of traditional jazz players[2].
