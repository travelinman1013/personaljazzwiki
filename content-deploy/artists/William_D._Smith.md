## Biography
William Daniel 'Smitty' Smith (August 30, 1944 – November 28, 1997) was a highly respected keyboardist and session musician, best known for his work in the Canadian music scene from the 1960s through the 1980s. Born in Belleville, Virginia, Smith began playing professionally in the U.S. at age 15 before relocating to Toronto in the early 1960s, where he quickly became a fixture in the city's vibrant soul and rock scene[2][3]. His early career was marked by collaborations with the Soul Searchers, a band fronted by Eric Mercury and Diane Brooks, which included musicians like Steve Kennedy, Eric 'Mouse' Johnson, and Terry Logan[1][2]. After the Soul Searchers disbanded, Smith and Kennedy joined Grant Smith & The Power before forming Motherlode in 1969, a group that achieved international success with the hit single 'When I Die,' which reached #18 on the U.S. charts and #5 in Canada[1][2]. Motherlode was hailed as Canada's first 'supergroup,' and their debut album featured another Top 30 hit, 'Memories of a Broken Promise'[2].

In the 1970s, Smith transitioned to session work, contributing keyboards and background vocals to recordings by a remarkable array of artists, including Bob Dylan, David Clayton-Thomas, Billy Joel, The Pointer Sisters, Bonnie Raitt, Linda Ronstadt, Etta James, Blood, Sweat & Tears, Richie Havens, Tracy Chapman, Rod Stewart, Bruce Willis, and Brenda Russell[1][2]. He released two solo albums, 'A Good Feelin'' (1975) and 'Smitty' (1978), the latter recorded at the legendary Muscle Shoals Sound Studio with the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section[1][2]. Smith's musical style blended rock, soul, and jazz, and he was known for his expressive Hammond B3 organ playing and soulful vocals. Despite suffering a stroke in 1992, Smith continued to write and perform until his death from a heart attack in 1997. His legacy endures through his recordings, his influence on subsequent generations of musicians, and the enduring popularity of Motherlode's music, which has been sampled and covered by artists such as D'Angelo, Neneh Cherry, Gangstarr, DJ Premier, and J Dilla[2].
