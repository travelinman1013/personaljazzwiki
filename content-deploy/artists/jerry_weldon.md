## Biography
Jerry Weldon, a native New Yorker, was introduced to jazz at age fourteen when his father took him to see Stan Getz at the Village Vanguard, igniting his passion for music and inspiring him to pursue a professional career as a tenor saxophonist. His father cautioned him, 'Then you have to be good,' a challenge Weldon embraced through rigorous training at Rutgers University's Jazz Studies Program, from which he graduated in 1981. This early exposure to live jazz and formal education laid the foundation for his powerful, soulful sound deeply rooted in hard bop and soul jazz traditions.[1][2][3]

Immediately after graduation, Weldon joined the legendary Lionel Hampton Orchestra, performing with them until Hampton's death in 2002, and later became a charter member and featured soloist in Harry Connick Jr.'s big band in 1990, touring globally across the U.S., Europe, Asia, and Australia, appearing in Connick's Broadway production 'Thou Shalt Not,' and serving as part of the house band on Connick's television show 'HARRY' from 2016 to 2018. He also had extended stints with organist Jack McDuff's 'Heatin' System' and worked with Jimmy McGriff, Joey DeFrancesco, and Bobby Forrester, alongside jazz icons like George Cables, Al Grey, Roy Haynes, Jimmy Cobb, George Benson, and Mel Tormé. Over more than 45 years, Weldon has released eight albums as a leader, including his latest 'On the Move' which charted on Jazz Week, and appeared on numerous sideman recordings, maintaining a dynamic stage presence at venues like Showman's in Harlem and international festivals.[1][2][3][4]

Renowned as a 'musician’s musician' and showman, Weldon's warm, fat tenor sound can roar like a thunderstorm or soothe like a summer breeze, embodying the bar-walking, hard-blowing tenor tradition. Critics like Ira Gitler have hailed him as 'one of the strongest tenormen on the scene today,' and he continues to lead his own groups while performing as an in-demand sideman worldwide, ensuring his legacy in the New York jazz scene endures.[1][3][4]
