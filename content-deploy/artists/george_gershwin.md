## Biography
George Gershwin, born Jacob Gershowitz on September 26, 1898, in Brooklyn, New York, was a pioneering American composer and pianist whose work bridged the worlds of jazz, popular music, and classical composition. Dropping out of school at 15, Gershwin quickly immersed himself in the vibrant New York music scene, working as a pianist in nightclubs, a 'song-plugger' in Tin Pan Alley, and a rehearsal pianist for Broadway productions. His early exposure to diverse musical styles laid the foundation for his unique ability to blend jazz idioms with classical forms. By 1916, he published his first song, and his career rapidly ascended with hits like 'Rhapsody in Blue' (1924), 'An American in Paris' (1928), and the folk opera 'Porgy and Bess' (1935), which became one of the most important American musical works of the 20th century.

Gershwin's musical style was marked by rhythmic vitality, melodic inventiveness, and a seamless fusion of popular and classical elements. He collaborated closely with his lyricist brother Ira, producing numerous Broadway musicals and enduring standards such as 'Embraceable You' and 'I Got Rhythm.' His work attracted admiration from classical composers like Maurice Ravel and Sergey Prokofiev, and his compositions have become jazz standards and film classics. Despite his tragically short life—he died of a brain tumor in 1937 at age 38—Gershwin's legacy endures as a foundational figure in American music, influencing generations of composers and performers.
