## Biography
John Albert Wright (September 7, 1934 – December 15, 2017) was an American jazz pianist celebrated for his contributions to the Chicago jazz scene, particularly during the 1960s. Born in Louisville, Kentucky, Wright moved to Chicago at age two, where his mother, an evangelistic preacher, founded a church. Immersed in gospel music from a young age, Wright began playing piano at seven and later played organ at the Christian Hope M.B. Baptist Church. His formative musical experiences were rooted in the vibrant church community and local high school jazz circles.

Wright's career took a decisive turn after he enlisted in the military in 1952, where he was stationed in Germany with the 7th Army Special Services. There, he honed his jazz piano skills and interacted with prominent musicians such as Dizzy Gillespie and Dexter Gordon. Returning to Chicago in 1955, Wright quickly established himself in local clubs and, in 1960, began recording for Prestige Records, releasing five albums between 1960 and 1962, including the notable 'South Side Soul.' Throughout his career, Wright remained active in Chicago's jazz venues and later served as a librarian at the Cook County Jail. He recorded his final album, 'Wright Changes & Choices,' in 1994 and was honored with several awards, including induction into the Wendell Phillips High School Hall of Fame and the Walter Dyett Lifetime Achievement Award.

Wright's musical style was deeply influenced by gospel traditions, blending soulful melodies with jazz improvisation. His nickname, 'South Side Soul,' reflects his ability to infuse jazz with the emotional depth of gospel. Known for his collaborations with leading jazz musicians and his mentorship within the Chicago jazz community, Wright left a lasting legacy as both a performer and advocate for jazz education and appreciation.
