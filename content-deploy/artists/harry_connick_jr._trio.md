## Biography
The Harry Connick, Jr. Trio is the small‑group jazz incarnation of American pianist, singer, and composer Harry Connick Jr., whose musical foundation lies in the rich piano and jazz traditions of his native New Orleans.[5][1] Connick showed prodigious talent early, learning keyboards at three, performing publicly by five, and later studying with influential New Orleans masters Ellis Marsalis and James Booker at the New Orleans Center for Creative Arts.[6][3] After brief studies in classical and jazz piano at Loyola University and later at Hunter College and the Manhattan School of Music in New York, he signed with Columbia Records as a teenager and released his self‑titled debut in 1987, followed by the album “20” in 1988, which began to showcase both his piano playing and vocals.[4][2]

Connick’s trio work crystallized on the 1990 instrumental jazz trio album “Lofty’s Roach Souffle,” which emphasized his straight‑ahead jazz piano in a classic piano‑bass‑drums setting.[2][4] The Harry Connick, Jr. Trio became the vehicle for his more intimate, pianist‑centered performances, contrasting with his high‑profile big‑band and orchestral projects such as “We Are in Love,” “Blue Light, Red Light” and later “Come By Me.”[1][4] In trio format, Connick draws heavily on New Orleans rhythm, stride piano, bebop vocabulary, and the harmonic language of his mentors, blending standards, originals, and grooves that move between traditional jazz, blues, and modern swing.[1][6] While Connick is widely recognized for bringing swing and big‑band music back into the pop spotlight through projects like the multi‑platinum “When Harry Met Sally…” soundtrack, his trio work underpins his reputation among jazz listeners as a serious pianist, linking contemporary mainstream jazz piano to the New Orleans lineage of Booker, Marsalis, and earlier Crescent City stylists.[2][6]

Over the decades, the Harry Connick, Jr. Trio has functioned both as a recording and touring unit and as the core rhythm section within Connick’s broader musical universe, from club dates and small theaters to select tracks on his larger ensemble albums.[2][4] Although Connick’s larger‑scale endeavors—Grammy‑winning vocal albums, film scores, Broadway compositions, and television work—brought him global fame, his trio format remains central to his musical identity: a space where his improvisational skills, time feel, and New Orleans sensibility are foregrounded.[1][5] These trio performances and recordings have contributed to sustaining interest in acoustic jazz piano within a generation more likely to know him from film and television, quietly reinforcing his legacy not only as an entertainer but as a jazz musician deeply rooted in American piano traditions.[1][2]

## Fun Facts
- Harry Connick Jr. began performing publicly on piano and voice at about five years old in New Orleans, long before he led his own trio or signed a major‑label contract.[5][6]
- The Harry Connick, Jr. Trio’s prominent introduction to many listeners came through the 1990 instrumental album “Lofty’s Roach Souffle,” released the same year Connick also put out the big‑band vocal album “We Are in Love.”[2][4]
- Connick’s early trio and instrumental work was developed while he was simultaneously launching a parallel career in film, making his screen debut in the World War II film “Memphis Belle” in 1990.[2][4]
