## Biography
Gábor Szabó (March 8, 1936 – February 26, 1982) was a Hungarian-American jazz guitarist renowned for blending jazz, pop, rock, and the folk music of his native Hungary. Born in Budapest, Szabó began playing guitar at age 14, inspired by American jazz heard on the radio and by a Roy Rogers film. After fleeing Hungary during the 1956 revolution, he spent time in an Austrian refugee camp before emigrating to California, where he initially worked menial jobs to support himself. He later attended the Berklee College of Music in Boston from 1958 to 1960, further honing his craft.

Szabó's professional breakthrough came in 1961 when he joined Chico Hamilton’s quintet, performing alongside Charles Lloyd and helping to shape the group’s innovative sound. His tenure with Hamilton lasted until 1965, after which Szabó launched a solo career, releasing his acclaimed debut album 'Spellbinder' in 1966. His signature style fused single-note jazz phrasing with chordal flurries, metallic tones, and experimental techniques such as feedback and sitar-like drones. Szabó was also influenced by contemporary rock guitarists and Indian classical music, and his composition 'Gypsy Queen' became widely known after being covered by Santana. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, he recorded prolifically, collaborated with a diverse range of artists, and co-founded the Skye record label.

Despite his innovations, Szabó felt underappreciated in the American jazz scene. He spent his later years performing and recording with artists such as Lena Horne and Bobby Womack, and continued to experiment with genre and sound. Szabó died in Budapest in 1982 from liver and kidney disease while seeking treatment for drug addiction, leaving behind a legacy as a pioneering and genre-defying guitarist.
