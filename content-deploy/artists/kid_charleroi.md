## Biography
Kid Charleroi is a Lafayette, Louisiana–based band whose music blends a modern indie sensibility with the lush, melodic textures of 1970s soft rock. Emerging from the rich musical culture of south Louisiana, the group draws on classic pop songwriting, warm analog-leaning sonics, and introspective lyrics, positioning themselves slightly left of the contemporary Cajun and zydeco traditions more commonly associated with their region.[4] Fronted by songwriter and vocalist/guitarist Amanda Sphar, the band gradually took shape on the Lafayette scene, refining a sound that favors detailed arrangements, smooth vocal harmonies, and a laid‑back but carefully crafted groove, echoing the AM‑radio soft rock era while remaining firmly rooted in the present.[4][5]

In 2023, Kid Charleroi released their self‑titled debut album on New Orleans–based independent label Strange Daisy Records, a catalog known for eclectic, art‑forward projects.[4] Around that time they appeared in KRVS’s Medicine Ball Caravan Live Sessions, performing original songs like “Doesn’t Get Better” and “Daytime Moon,” which showcased their easygoing rhythmic feel, clean guitar work, and Sphar’s understated, emotive vocal delivery.[5] Although still early in their career, Kid Charleroi have begun to carve out a niche in the Gulf South indie ecosystem as torchbearers of a revived soft‑rock aesthetic, filtering the genre’s classic smoothness through the perspectives of contemporary Louisiana musicians.[4] Their growing presence on regional radio sessions, local press, and the Strange Daisy roster suggests the potential for a lasting contribution to the evolving narrative of Lafayette’s non‑traditional guitar‑band scene.

Because Kid Charleroi is a relatively new and locally focused project, detailed public reporting on each member’s early life and the band’s complete formation history remains limited in available sources.[4][5] What is clear from coverage and live documentation is that the group’s identity is closely tied to Lafayette’s collaborative community of indie artists and to Strange Daisy’s emphasis on thoughtfully produced albums, indicating that their legacy—at least in this early stage—lies in helping expand the stylistic range associated with south Louisiana guitar music beyond roots genres toward a more cosmopolitan, soft‑rock‑informed sound.[4]
