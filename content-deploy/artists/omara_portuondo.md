## Biography
Omara Portuondo, born on October 29, 1930, in the Cayo Hueso neighborhood of Havana, Cuba, is one of the most celebrated vocalists in Cuban music history. Raised in a musically rich environment—her father was a professional baseball player and her mother a passionate music lover—Omara was encouraged to pursue the arts from an early age. She began her career as a dancer at the famed Tropicana Club alongside her sister Haydée, but soon transitioned to singing, performing with the jazz group Loquibambia Swing led by José Antonio Méndez and pianist Frank Emilio Flynn. Her early exposure to the 'filin’' style—a Cuban bolero infused with jazz harmonies—shaped her distinctive vocal approach.[1][3][4]

Portuondo's breakthrough came as a founding member of the all-female vocal quartet Cuarteto d'Aida, directed by Aida Diestro, where she performed with Elena Burke, Moraima Secada, and her sister Haydée. The group became a sensation in 1950s Cuba, backing stars such as Benny Moré and Nat King Cole, and touring internationally. After the Cuban Revolution, Omara continued to perform and record both in Cuba and abroad, eventually launching a successful solo career in 1967. Her versatility allowed her to explore genres from bolero and son cubano to Latin jazz, collaborating with leading Cuban and international artists. In 1996, she joined the Buena Vista Social Club project, which brought her global recognition and revitalized her career for new generations.[1][2][3][5]

Omara Portuondo's legacy is marked by her advocacy for Afro-Cuban women in music, her role in defining the 'filin’' ballad style, and her enduring influence across Latin and world music. She has received numerous accolades, including a Latin Grammy Award and the Latin Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, and continues to perform and record well into her nineties, remaining a beloved figure in Cuban culture and beyond.[2][5]
