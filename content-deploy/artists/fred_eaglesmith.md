## Biography
Fred Eaglesmith, born Frederick John Elgersma on July 9, 1957 in Caistor Centre, Ontario, Canada, is a celebrated Canadian alternative country singer-songwriter. Raised as one of nine children in a rural farming family, Eaglesmith’s early life was steeped in the realities of rural existence, which would later become a central theme in his songwriting. At age 15, he left home, hopping freight trains across Western Canada, an experience that contributed to his vivid storytelling and the working-class authenticity that permeates his music[1][5][6].

Eaglesmith began his musical career in the 1980s, forming bands such as the Smokin' Losers and later the Flying Squirrels and the Flathead Noodlers, each reflecting different musical styles from bluegrass to folk-rock. His songwriting is renowned for its narrative depth, often featuring unreliable narrators, surprise endings, and plot twists, drawing comparisons to short story writers. Eaglesmith’s songs explore themes of vehicles, rural hardship, lost love, and quirky characters, delivered with a raw, existential realism. Over the decades, he has maintained artistic independence, recording most of his 20-plus albums on his own label and cultivating a fiercely loyal fanbase known as 'Fredheads.' His legacy is that of a musical chameleon and pioneer in alt-country and Americana, influencing the genre with his uncompromising vision and poetic lyricism[1][2][4].

In recent years, Eaglesmith has toured extensively with his wife and musical partner, Tif Ginn, transitioning from larger band formats to an intimate duo. Together, they have continued to produce new music and perform select concerts, further cementing Eaglesmith’s reputation as a prolific and innovative force in North American roots music[1][3].
