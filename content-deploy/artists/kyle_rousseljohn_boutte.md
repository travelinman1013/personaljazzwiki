## Biography
Kyle Roussel, born April 26, 1988, in Boutte, Louisiana, is a celebrated American pianist, composer, producer, arranger, and educator who has become one of New Orleans’ most prominent musical voices. Raised in a musically supportive family, he began playing piano by ear as a child and received formal classical training from Frozine Francis at age nine. His early exposure to church music across various denominations deeply influenced his stylistic versatility.
