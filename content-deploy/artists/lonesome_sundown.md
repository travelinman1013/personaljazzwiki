## Biography
Lonesome Sundown, born Cornelius Green III on December 12, 1928, on the Dugas Plantation near Donaldsonville, Louisiana, emerged as a significant figure in the swamp blues scene of the 1950s and 1960s. After working various jobs in New Orleans and returning to his hometown, Green was inspired by blues legends like Muddy Waters and John Lee Hooker, prompting him to learn guitar from his cousin. His early musical journey included a stint with the Zydeco Ramblers before he moved to Opelousas, Louisiana, where he began writing his own songs and collaborating with local musicians.[1][2]

Green's breakthrough came when he recorded a demo for producer J. D. "Jay" Miller in Crowley, who gave him the stage name "Lonesome Sundown" and helped launch his career with Excello Records. His distinctive style blended the emotive storytelling of classic blues with the rhythmic, atmospheric qualities of Louisiana swamp blues. Notable tracks like "Lonesome Whistler" and "My Home Is a Prison" showcased his understated vocal delivery and expressive guitar work, setting him apart from his contemporaries. Despite early success, Sundown's career waned by the mid-1960s, leading him to retire from music for a period, during which he became a minister. He made a brief comeback in the late 1970s, recording the album "Been Gone Too Long" and performing at major festivals before retiring for good.[1][2][3]

Lonesome Sundown's legacy endures through his influential recordings and his role in shaping the swamp blues genre. He was posthumously inducted into the Louisiana Blues Hall of Fame in 2000, and his music continues to be celebrated for its authenticity, technical fluency, and evocative songwriting. Sundown died in Gonzales, Louisiana, on April 23, 1995, after suffering a stroke the previous year.[1][3]
