## Biography
Norman Richard West, Jr., born on October 30, 1939, in Monroe, Louisiana, grew up singing in church alongside his brothers Joe, James, and Robert, which laid the foundation for his musical career. He entered the professional music scene early, replacing William Bell in The Del-Rios in 1962 and later recording several unsuccessful solo singles in Memphis. West also performed with Colors Incorporated, a rock band formed by members of Jerry Lee Lewis' band, before joining The Soul Children in 1968, a vocal quartet assembled by Stax Records producers Isaac Hayes and David Porter.[1][3]

As a key member of The Soul Children alongside John Colbert (J. Blackfoot), Anita Louis, and Shelbra Bennett, West contributed to the group's soul and disco sound, co-writing hits like 'Hearsay,' which reached No. 5 on the R&B chart. The group achieved success with singles such as 'I'll Be the Other Woman' and performed at the iconic Wattstax concert in 1972. After Stax's collapse in 1975, West continued with a trio on Epic Records before the group disbanded. He persisted in nightclub performances and gospel music, reforming The Soul Children in 2007 with J. Blackfoot, Ann Hines, and Cassandra Graham for the album *Still Standing*, and released a solo single 'Long Ride Home' in 2008.[1]

West's style rooted in R&B and soul reflects his gospel upbringing and Stax-era experiences, contributing to the label's legacy of gritty, emotive vocal harmonies. Though not a solo superstar, his enduring nightclub and gospel work underscores a steadfast commitment to music into later years.[1][3]
