## Biography
The Human League is a British synthpop and new wave band formed in 1977 in Sheffield, England, by Martyn Ware and Ian Craig Marsh, two computer programmers who combined their love of pop music with avant-garde electronic experimentation. Initially calling themselves The Future, they recruited Phil Oakey as vocalist after he was famously invited to join by a note left on his door. The band's early work, including the influential 1978 single "Being Boiled"—which David Bowie called the "future of music"—established them as pioneers of electronic music, though their first two albums, Reproduction (1979) and Travelogue (1980), achieved only modest commercial success. A creative rift led to Ware and Marsh's departure in 1980 to form Heaven 17, leaving Oakey and Philip Adrian Wright to rebuild the band with bassist Ian Burden and vocalists Joanne Catherall and Susanne Sulley, recruited from a Sheffield nightclub.

Under producer Martin Rushent's direction, the reconstituted Human League achieved massive international success with their 1981 album Dare!, which spawned multiple hit singles including "Don't You Want Me"—their signature song that reached number one in both the UK and US. The album became a defining work of the New Romantic movement and established the band as one of the most successful acts of the 1980s. Though their commercial momentum slowed after the mid-1980s, with albums like Hysteria (1984) and Crash (1986) showing diminishing returns, the band experienced a notable comeback in 1995 as a trio with the album Octopus and its hit single "Tell Me When." The Human League continued recording and performing into the 2010s, with their final album Credo released in 2011, cementing their legacy as electronic music pioneers who influenced generations of artists from Madonna to Pet Shop Boys to Moby.

Phil Oakey remains the only consistent member since the band's formation, and the group continues to perform today as a trio with Oakey, Joanne Catherall, and Susan Anne Sulley. Their influence on synthpop, new wave, and electronic music remains profound, with their innovative use of synthesizers and distinctive visual presentation helping to define the aesthetic of 1980s pop culture.

## Fun Facts
- Phil Oakey was invited to join The Human League by a note left stuck to his door by Martyn Ware, an old school friend, despite Oakey having never been in a band before and working as a hospital porter at the time.
- "Being Boiled," the band's 1978 debut single, was so influential that David Bowie called it the "future of music," and it later became extremely influential on industrial musicians including Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails.
- The band's most iconic hit "Don't You Want Me" reached number one in the UK during Christmas 1981 and was one of the biggest selling singles of that year, also reaching number one in the US during summer 1982.
- Philip Adrian Wright originally joined The Human League as their "director of visuals" to provide visual effects for live shows, an unusual role for a band member at the time, before becoming a full keyboard player.
