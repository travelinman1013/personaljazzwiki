## Biography
Joseph Nathan 'King' Oliver, born December 19, 1881, in Aben, Louisiana, was a foundational figure in early jazz, renowned as a cornetist, bandleader, and composer. Growing up in New Orleans, Oliver absorbed the city's rich musical traditions, learning from local brass bands and honing his skills in the city's vibrant Storyville district. After an incident led to his arrest during a dance, Oliver relocated to Chicago in 1918, where he quickly became a central figure in the city's burgeoning jazz scene, working with fellow New Orleans transplants and eventually forming his own ensembles[1].

Oliver's career reached its zenith in the early 1920s with King Oliver's Creole Jazz Band, which featured a young Louis Armstrong on second cornet and became famous for its collective improvisation and recordings that brought New Orleans-style jazz to a national audience[1][4]. By the mid-1920s, Oliver expanded his group into King Oliver and His Dixie Syncopators, a larger ensemble that incorporated more written arrangements and jazz solos, reflecting the evolving tastes of the era[1][2]. Despite initial success, Oliver's move to New York in 1927 marked the beginning of a decline, exacerbated by health issues (notably severe gum disease that impaired his playing) and the economic challenges of the Great Depression. He continued to lead bands and record until 1937, but never regained his earlier prominence[1][2]. Oliver's legacy endures through his innovative use of mutes, his role in mentoring Armstrong, and his classic compositions like 'Dippermouth Blues,' which remain jazz standards[1][4].

## Fun Facts
- Oliver pioneered the use of mutes—including a rubber plumber's plunger, derby hat, bottles, and cups—to alter his cornet's sound, most famously on 'Dippermouth Blues'[1].
- He turned down a lucrative contract at the Cotton Club in New York, a decision that allowed Duke Ellington to take the gig and rise to fame[3].
- Oliver's composition 'Doctor Jazz' was later popularized by Jelly Roll Morton, though Oliver wrote it first[3].
- Despite his innovations, Oliver's later career was hampered by severe gum disease, which eventually forced him to stop playing[1][2].
