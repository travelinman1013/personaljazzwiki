## Biography
Love Moor is the stage name of **Erica Andrew**, a singer, songwriter, and producer whose intimate blend of R&B, neo‑soul, and indie sensibilities has made her a distinctive voice emerging from Birmingham, Alabama’s music scene.[3] Born and raised in Miami, Florida, she grew up in a Caribbean household where music was a constant presence, with relatives playing everything from reggae and soca to American soul, laying a foundation for her genre‑blurring approach.[3] She later relocated to Birmingham, where she began to find her artistic footing, performing in local venues, collaborating with area musicians, and gradually building a reputation for emotionally candid songwriting and atmospheric, groove‑driven production.

Over the mid‑2010s and beyond, Love Moor developed from a local favorite into an artist gaining attention well beyond the so‑called “Magic City,” thanks to a series of independently released projects and singles that highlighted her laid‑back yet incisive vocal delivery.[3] Her music typically mixes hazy, downtempo beats with introspective lyrics about love, desire, self‑worth, and healing, often delivered in a conversational tone that blurs the line between singing and confessional narration. Critics and local media have placed her within a broader wave of Southern alternative R&B artists who draw from hip‑hop, electronic textures, and classic soul while maintaining a strong DIY ethic.[3] Though still in the earlier stages of her career, her work has contributed to reshaping perceptions of Birmingham as a hub for experimental, forward‑thinking Black music, inspiring younger local artists to see a path for themselves in the city’s growing creative community.[3]
