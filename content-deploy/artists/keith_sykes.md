## Biography
Keith Sykes was born on October 24, 1948, in Murray, Kentucky, and relocated to Memphis, Tennessee at age eight, where he would spend his formative years and eventually establish himself as a significant figure in American songwriting.[5] His musical journey began in earnest in 1968 when, at just 19 years old, he performed his first real gig at a Holiday Inn in Downtown Charleston, South Carolina, after only two years of playing guitar.[1] After cutting his teeth on the Coffee House Circuit in New York City during the late 1960s, where he recorded two albums for the Vanguard label (his self-titled debut in 1969 and "1-2-3" in 1970), Sykes embarked on a nomadic musical odyssey that took him from New York to Austin, Texas, and eventually to Memphis, where he would find his true home.[1][4]

Sykes' career trajectory reflects a commitment to artistic authenticity and continuous reinvention. In the mid-1970s, he established himself in the Memphis music scene, recording the album "I'm Not Strange, I'm Just Like You" at Ardent Studios, which became an instant local hit and attracted major label attention.[1] His breakthrough came when he signed with MCA Records on Tom Petty's Backstreet label, leading to a memorable appearance on Saturday Night Live—a career highlight he still cherishes.[1] Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Sykes diversified his career by building The Woodshed recording studio in 1993, founding Syren Records in 1997, and hosting influential songwriter showcases on Beale Street featuring Hall of Fame writers and contemporary artists.[1] As a massively successful songwriter, Sykes has had more than 100 songs recorded by artists as diverse as Rosanne Cash and George Thorogood, cementing his legacy not just as a performer but as a prolific and respected songwriter.[3]

After a period of reduced touring in the 1990s, Sykes returned to performing as his primary focus in 2001, releasing "Don't Count Us Out" and subsequently recording numerous albums across various independent labels including Syren Records, Madjack Records, Fat Pete Records, and Aimless Records.[1] His later work, including the 2008 acoustic album "Country Morning Music," showcases his evolution as an artist while maintaining the songwriting excellence that has defined his four-decade career.
