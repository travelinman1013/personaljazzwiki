## Biography
DJ Tunez, Wizkid & Fola is a cross‑generational Afrobeats collaboration that unites Nigerian‑American DJ and producer DJ Tunez, global Afrobeats star Wizkid, and fast‑rising Nigerian singer‑songwriter Fola. DJ Tunez (Michael Babatunde Adeyinka), born May 10, 1989 and raised in South Brooklyn to Nigerian parents, honed his craft DJing church and community events before building a reputation on the New York African party circuit.[2] His blend of Afrobeats, dancehall, and house led to his signing with Wizkid’s Starboy Entertainment in 2015, cementing him as one of the key DJs and producers exporting contemporary Nigerian sounds worldwide.[2] Wizkid, already an established superstar and label boss, brought global visibility, melodic direction, and Starboy’s brand power to the partnership.

Fola (Folarin Odunlami), born April 26, 2001 in Ibadan, Oyo State, represents a younger wave of Afrobeats talent.[3] Growing up in a musical household where his father played keyboards and his mother sang in the church choir, he shifted from early ambitions in football to music, posting covers and freestyles online while studying Economics at the University of Lagos.[3] Influenced by Nigerian icons such as 2Baba, Wizkid, Wande Coal, and Naeto C, he developed a fuji‑toned, soulful vocal style over Afrobeat rhythms, later formalizing his career with releases like the EP “What A Feeling” and his debut album “Catharsis.”[3] His studio session with Wizkid and DJ Tunez, arranged through Wizkid’s team after a chance encounter with Davido, produced what Nigerian media described as “one of the biggest records” of 2022–25, marking a turning point in his mainstream rise.[1]

Musically, the DJ Tunez, Wizkid & Fola configuration embodies the evolution of Afrobeats into a global, hybrid sound. DJ Tunez’s club‑tested production sensibility, rooted in Afrobeats and dancehall grooves, meets Wizkid’s sleek Afropop and R&B melodies and Fola’s fuji‑coloured, emotionally driven vocals.[2][3] Their work together extends Wizkid’s Starboy tradition of spotlighting emerging Nigerian voices, while giving Fola a powerful platform and further diversifying DJ Tunez’s catalog of collaborations with leading Afrobeats artists. Though still a relatively new combination, the trio’s session is frequently cited in Nigerian coverage as a career‑defining moment for Fola and an example of how established Afrobeats figures nurture the next generation.[1][3]

## Fun Facts
- DJ Tunez started by DJing Christmas parties at his local church in South Brooklyn as a teenager, which gradually evolved into paid gigs for community birthdays and weddings.[2]
- Fola originally wanted to be a professional footballer and spent long hours training before music—nurtured by his parents’ church involvement—pulled him in a different direction.[3]
- Fola first met Davido unexpectedly at a club, and a viral clip of that encounter circulated online just before Wizkid’s team called to invite him to the studio session with DJ Tunez and Wizkid.[1]
- A major studio session with Wizkid and DJ Tunez almost slipped away from Fola because he was in Bristol for an event when the call came; he later rushed back to London to make the session happen, which he describes as life‑changing.[1]
