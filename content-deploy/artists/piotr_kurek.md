## Biography
Piotr Kurek, born in Biłgoraj, Poland in 1978, is a Warsaw-based composer, multi-instrumentalist, and one of the most distinctive figures in Poland’s experimental music scene. He began his musical journey studying classical piano and playing drums, but soon gravitated toward genre-defying explorations that merged free jazz, musique concrète, psychedelia, and drone. Kurek’s early career included co-founding the electronic group Ślepcy in the late 1990s, a project regarded as a pioneering force in Poland’s experimental movement. 

Throughout the 2000s and 2010s, Kurek developed a prolific solo and collaborative output, releasing music under his own name and various aliases (such as P.Qrek and Heroiny) on labels like Crónica, Sangoplasmo, Mondoj, Edições CN, and Black Sweat Records. His work is characterized by a distinctive approach to sound, blending electronics, voice, and intricate editing into forms that resist easy categorization. Kurek’s music has been featured at major festivals (Unsound, CTM, OFF, TodaysArt, UH Fest) and he has participated in international residencies, further cementing his reputation as an adventurous and innovative artist. In addition to his albums, he has composed scores for film and theater, including for the feature films 'Mammalia' (Berlinale 2023) and 'Sweat' (Cannes 2020).
