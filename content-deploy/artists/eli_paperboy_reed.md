## Biography
Eli 'Paperboy' Reed, born around 1983-1984 in the Boston area, graduated from Brookline High School in 2001 (or 2002 per some accounts) and immediately pursued music full-time. After high school, he moved to Clarksdale, Mississippi, in 2002, immersing himself in juke joints like Red’s Lounge, where he fronted The Wesley Jefferson Southern Soul Band as guitarist, singer, and frontman in a trial-by-fire environment. He later played organ and guitar in the Chicago church of gospel legend Mitty Collier before returning to Boston by 2005, where he busked daily in Harvard Square, drove a flower delivery van, and self-released his debut album *Sings Walkin’ and Talkin’ (and other Smash Hits!)* in 2005, pressing 300 CDs recorded live to analog tape.[1][5]

Reed's career accelerated with his first all-original album *Roll With You* in 2008, produced by Ed Valauskas at Q Division Studios, earning critical acclaim and leading to a Capitol Records deal in 2009 for *Come and Get It* (2010). Major label challenges culminated in the less-supported *Nights Like This*, prompting a return to Brooklyn after the label's decline in 2015. He rebounded with *My Way Home* (2016) on Yep Roc Records, followed by *99 Cent Dreams* (2019) recorded at Sam Phillips Recording in Memphis with producer Matt Ross-Spang and drummer Ken Coomer, and a Merle Haggard tribute during 2020 lockdowns. His style blends retro soul, gospel, R&B, blues, and funk, marked by raw, soulful vocals, guitar, and harmonica, honed through relentless live performance.[1][2]

Now over 20 years into his career, Reed resides in Brooklyn, where parenthood—daughter Stella (born 2016) and son Oscar (2019)—has deepened his songwriting maturity. He has performed at the Grand Ole Opry, maintained high standards across nine albums, and continues touring with sweaty, searing live sets, embodying resilience in indie soul revival.[1][2]

## Fun Facts
- Worked as a flower delivery van driver in Boston mornings while busking in Harvard Square afternoons for tips, calling it 'the best job I ever had,' and practiced guitar, harmonica, and singing 3-4 hours daily above 50 degrees.[1]
- First 'professional' gig was fronting The Wesley Jefferson Southern Soul Band at rough juke joint Red’s Lounge in Clarksdale, MS, playing 9 PM-1 AM shortly after high school graduation.[1][3]
- Recorded *99 Cent Dreams* live in just nine days at Sam Phillips Recording in Memphis, using the echo chamber once used by Bob Dylan, Johnny Cash, and others.[2]
- Fulfilled a long-held dream during 2020 COVID lockdowns by recording a full album of Merle Haggard covers like 'Workin’ Man Blues' and 'Mama Tried,' leading to a Grand Ole Opry performance.[1]
