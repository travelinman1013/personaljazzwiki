## Biography
Ike & Tina Turner were an influential American musical duo formed by Ike Turner and Tina Turner (born Anna Mae Bullock). Their partnership began in St. Louis in the late 1950s when Tina, then a teenager, impressed Ike with her powerful, raspy voice and soon became the lead singer of his band, the Kings of Rhythm. The pair married in 1962 and launched the Ike & Tina Turner Revue, which quickly became renowned for its electrifying live performances, featuring Tina’s dynamic stage presence and Ike’s musical direction. Their early 1960s hits, including 'A Fool In Love,' 'It's Gonna Work Out Fine,' and 'I Idolize You,' established them as leading figures on the R&B circuit.

The duo’s musical style blended soul, R&B, and rock, characterized by Tina’s passionate vocals and energetic dancing, supported by the Ikettes and the Kings of Rhythm. In 1966, they collaborated with producer Phil Spector on the landmark single 'River Deep – Mountain High,' which found greater success in Europe than the U.S. Their popularity surged in the late 1960s and early 1970s with reinterpretations of rock songs like 'Proud Mary,' which won them a Grammy Award, and 'Nutbush City Limits.' Despite their professional achievements, their marriage was tumultuous, marked by Ike’s abuse and substance issues, leading to their split in 1976. Tina Turner went on to a legendary solo career, while Ike continued to work in music until his death in 2007. The duo’s legacy endures, with induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1991 and continued recognition for their contributions to soul and rock music.
