## Biography
Gal Costa, born Maria da Graça Costa Penna Burgos on September 26, 1945, in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil, emerged as one of the most influential voices in Brazilian music. Drawn to music from a young age, she was inspired by João Gilberto’s bossa nova and began working in a record store as a teenager to immerse herself in the musical world. Her professional debut came in 1964 at the Vila Velha Theatre in Salvador, performing alongside Caetano Veloso, Gilberto Gil, Maria Bethânia, and Tom Zé, marking the beginning of her deep involvement with the burgeoning MPB (Música Popular Brasileira) and Tropicália movements.[2][1]

Costa’s early recordings, including her debut album 'Domingo' (1967) with Caetano Veloso, and her self-titled solo album (1969), established her as a key figure in the Tropicália movement, blending traditional Brazilian styles with psychedelic and avant-garde influences. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, she released a series of acclaimed albums and was a founding member of the supergroup Doces Bárbaros, alongside Veloso, Gil, and Bethânia. Her repertoire spanned MPB, bossa nova, samba, and Brazilian jazz, and her performances were noted for their emotional intensity and stylistic versatility. Costa’s career was marked by both commercial success and critical acclaim, with hits like “Baby,” “Divino Maravilhoso,” and “Festa do Interior.”[2][1]

Gal Costa’s legacy is profound: she is celebrated for her vocal range, interpretive depth, and her role in shaping modern Brazilian music. She continued to innovate and collaborate with leading artists for decades, influencing generations of musicians. Her induction into the Carnegie Hall Hall of Fame and her participation in major cultural events, such as the 40 Years of Bossa Nova tribute, underscore her enduring impact on Brazilian and global music.[1][2]
