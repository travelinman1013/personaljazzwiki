## Biography
The Gap Band was a pioneering American funk and R&B group formed in 1967 in Tulsa, Oklahoma, by brothers Charlie, Ronnie, and Robert Wilson. Raised in a musical family—their father was a Pentecostal minister and their mother the church pianist—the Wilson brothers honed their skills singing in church before moving into Tulsa’s vibrant club scene. The band’s name pays homage to their roots, referencing Greenwood, Archer, and Pine streets in Tulsa’s historic Black Wall Street district, a community deeply affected by the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre.

The Gap Band’s early years included backing legendary Oklahoman Leon Russell and opening for acts like The Rolling Stones and Willie Nelson. Their breakthrough came in the late 1970s with a string of hits blending infectious funk grooves, soulful ballads, and electronic elements. Albums such as 'The Gap Band II,' 'The Gap Band III,' and 'Gap Band IV' produced classics like “Outstanding,” “You Dropped a Bomb on Me,” and “Burn Rubber (Why You Wanna Hurt Me),” earning them platinum records and a dominant presence on R&B charts throughout the 1980s. Their energetic performances and innovative sound influenced a generation of artists and have been widely sampled in hip-hop and R&B, cementing their legacy as one of the most influential funk bands of their era.

Although the group’s commercial success waned after the mid-1980s, The Gap Band’s music continued to resonate, with their songs sampled or covered by over 150 artists. The band remained active until the passing of Robert Wilson in 2010, after which the original lineup ceased performing. Their enduring influence is evident in the continued popularity of their music and the lasting impact they have had on contemporary R&B and hip-hop.
