## Biography
J.B. Hutto, born Joseph Benjamin Hutto on April 26, 1926, in Blackville, South Carolina, was a prominent American blues musician celebrated for his raw, energetic slide guitar style. After moving with his family to Augusta, Georgia, at age three, Hutto began his musical journey singing gospel with his siblings in a group called the Golden Crowns. The family relocated to Chicago in 1949 following his father's death, and after serving in the Korean War, Hutto immersed himself in the city's vibrant blues scene, initially playing drums and piano before settling on guitar.[3][4]

In the early 1950s, Hutto formed the Hawks, naming the band after the fierce Chicago wind. The original lineup included Eddie "Porkchop" Hines, Joe Custom, Earring George Mayweather, and Johnny Jones, and they recorded several singles for Chance Records in 1954. Disenchanted with the music industry after a violent incident in a club, Hutto took an eleven-year hiatus, working as a funeral home janitor. He returned to music in the mid-1960s with a new Hawks lineup and gained recognition through the Vanguard compilation 'Chicago/The Blues/Today! Vol. 1' and his acclaimed 1968 Delmark album 'Hawk Squat,' featuring Sunnyland Slim, Lee Jackson, and Maurice McIntyre.[2][3][4]

Hutto's aggressive slide guitar and exuberant stage presence influenced the Chicago blues sound, and he continued performing and recording until his death from cancer in Harvey, Illinois, on June 12, 1983. His legacy endures through his recordings, his signature red Airline guitar, and his nephew Lil' Ed Williams, who carries on the tradition.
