## Biography
Sugar Pie DeSanto, born Peylia Marsema Balinton on October 16, 1935, in Brooklyn, New York, was a powerhouse R&B singer and dancer who packed astonishing energy into her diminutive 4'11" frame. Born to a Filipino father and an African-American mother who was a concert pianist, she moved to the San Francisco Bay Area at age four, where she would spend most of her life. Her career began when legendary bandleader Johnny Otis discovered her at a San Francisco talent show in 1955, immediately signing her to her first recording contract and giving her the stage name "Sugar Pie." After touring with the Johnny Otis Revue, she joined the James Brown Revue from 1959 to 1960, where her electrifying performances—including wild dancing and standing back flips—proved she more than compensated for her small stature with immense talent and charisma.

DeSanto achieved national prominence in 1960 when her single "I Want to Know," recorded with her husband Pee Wee Kingsley on the Veltone label, reached number four on Billboard's R&B chart. This success led to a contract with Chess Records in 1962, where she became one of the label's most prolific artists both as a performer and songwriter. Her Chess recordings included hits like "Slip-in Mules" (an answer song to Tommy Tucker's "Hi-Heel Sneakers"), "Soulful Dress," and "Use What You Got." In 1965 and 1966, she recorded two historic duets with childhood friend Etta James—"Do I Make Myself Clear" and "In the Basement"—the latter of which was featured in the 1999 film The Hurricane. Under various names including Peylia Parham, she wrote songs for numerous Chess artists including Billy Stewart, Fontella Bass, Little Milton, The Dells, and The Whispers, compiling a songbook of over 100 compositions.

DeSanto's appeal extended internationally, particularly with the Northern Soul movement in England, where her records became favorites. She even left the 1964 American Folk Blues Festival's European tour to make additional U.K. appearances. After parting ways with Chess, she eventually returned to Oakland, California, where she remained active performing well into her 80s. Her contributions were recognized with numerous honors including a 1999 Bay Area Music Award for Best Female Blues Singer, a 2008 Pioneer Award from the Rhythm and Blues Foundation, a 2009 Lifetime Achievement Award from the Bay Guardian's Goldie Awards, and induction into the Blues Hall of Fame in 2024. She passed away on December 20, 2024, at age 89, leaving behind a legacy as the "Queen of the West Coast Blues."
