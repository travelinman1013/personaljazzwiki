## Biography
Foreststorn "Chico" Hamilton (September 20, 1921 – November 25, 2013) was a pioneering American jazz drummer and bandleader, born in Los Angeles, California. Hamilton's early musical education was shaped by playing in high school bands alongside future jazz luminaries such as Charles Mingus, Dexter Gordon, and Buddy Collette. He began his professional career in the 1940s, performing with leading figures like Lionel Hampton, Count Basie, and Lena Horne, and gained wider recognition as the drummer in Gerry Mulligan’s influential piano-less quartet, which helped define the cool jazz movement.

In 1955, Hamilton formed his own quintet, notable for its innovative use of the cello as a lead instrument, creating a unique chamber jazz sound that stood out in the West Coast jazz scene. Over the decades, his ensembles became incubators for emerging talent, with musicians such as Eric Dolphy, Charles Lloyd, and Gábor Szabó passing through his ranks. Hamilton’s music evolved through cool jazz, hard bop, and jazz fusion, and he was known for his subtle, creative drumming and his ability to blend jazz with elements of classical, funk, and soul. He also composed for film and television, leaving a lasting legacy as both a performer and a mentor.

Hamilton is celebrated for his role in shaping the sound of modern jazz and for his keen eye for young talent. His innovative approach to rhythm and ensemble arrangement, as well as his openness to new musical ideas, made him a central figure in jazz for over six decades.
