## Biography
Bonsoir Catin is a dynamic Cajun band formed in Louisiana, celebrated for their innovative approach to traditional Cajun music. The group was founded by Kristi Guillory (accordion, vocals) and Christine Balfa (acoustic guitar, vocals), both deeply rooted in the region’s musical heritage. Guillory and Balfa, along with bandmates Anya Burgess (fiddle, vocals), Maegan Berard (electric guitar, vocals), Ashley Hayes Steele (bass guitar, vocals), and Daniel Devillier (drums, percussion, vocals), have crafted a sound that honors the classic forms of Cajun music while infusing it with elements of rock, blues, funk, R&B, and even classical music. Their French lyrics and evocative storytelling often explore themes of desire, heartbreak, and empowerment, with a distinctive feminist perspective that sets them apart in the genre[1][3][4].

The band’s career began in the mid-2000s, quickly gaining recognition for their energetic live performances and original songwriting. Their debut CD was released in September 2006, and they have since performed at major festivals and venues across Louisiana and beyond, including the Breaux Bridge Crawfish Festival and the Blackpot Festival. Bonsoir Catin’s 2014 album 'L’aurore' exemplifies their blend of tradition and innovation, featuring ten original songs and arrangements that range from dancehall-ready two-steps to impressionistic ballads inspired by experiences as far-flung as Paris and Alaska. The group’s commitment to the preservation and evolution of Cajun music has earned them a Grammy nomination and a reputation as one of the most influential contemporary Cajun ensembles[1][2][3].

Bonsoir Catin’s legacy is marked by their role in revitalizing Cajun music for new audiences, particularly through their emphasis on female perspectives and collaborative songwriting. Their work not only preserves the language and culture of Louisiana French communities but also pushes the boundaries of what Cajun music can be, ensuring its continued relevance and vitality[1][4].

## Fun Facts
- The band's name, 'Bonsoir, Catin,' means 'Good Night, Doll' in Louisiana French[1].
- Their album 'L’aurore' was inspired in part by a night in Juneau, Alaska, where the band performed and then witnessed the northern lights, which influenced the title track’s classical fadeout[1].
- Bonsoir Catin was Grammy-nominated, a rare honor for Cajun bands, reflecting their impact beyond regional music circles[3].
- Christine Balfa is the daughter of Dewey Balfa, a legendary figure in Cajun music, and has performed since childhood, carrying on her family’s musical legacy[7][8].
