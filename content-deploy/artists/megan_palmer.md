## Biography
Megan Palmer is a singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist who has established herself as a distinctive voice in the East Nashville music scene. Originally from Ohio, Palmer began her musical journey playing violin from a young age, performing in the Coventry String Quartet in Cleveland starting in sixth grade. Her path as a touring musician began in earnest in 2002 when she was asked to join Canadian band Luther Wright & The Wrongs after an opening performance with Dan Dougan's band The Wahoos at Little Brother's club in Columbus. This touring experience from 2002 to early 2004 served as the catalyst for her songwriting career, as she began crafting the songs that would appear on her debut album.

Palmer released her debut album "Forget Me Not" on April 22, 2006, which was recorded across multiple sessions in Hamilton, Ontario and Columbus, Ohio with producer Jeff Ciampa and engineer Brian Lucey. The album was noted for its mature songwriting and attracted a substantial cross-section of Columbus musicians to participate. After establishing herself in Ohio's music scene, Palmer moved to East Nashville approximately 10 years ago, where she quickly became one of the most sought-after multi-instrumentalists and vocalists, backing artists such as Tim Easton, Amy Speace, Anne McCue, and Darrin Bradbury. Her musical style blends Americana and adult alternative influences, characterized by an austere, affectation-free vocal delivery and intelligent, deft melodies.

What sets Palmer apart is her unique dual career as both an artist and healer. A Registered Nurse for over 20 years, she currently works at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Palliative Care. This duality profoundly influenced her 2020 EP "Take Good Care," a five-song project she co-wrote with her nursing colleagues during the COVID-19 pandemic to process the complex emotions of end-of-life care. The album, recorded at Bomb Shelter studio and produced by Andrija Tokic, features 1960s soul arpeggios blended with darker new-wave inspired elements. Palmer, also a breast cancer survivor, brings her experiences as both musician and caregiver into her songwriting, creating what has been described as healing music that embodies compassion and hope.
