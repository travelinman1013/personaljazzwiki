## Biography
Danny Gatton (September 4, 1945 – October 4, 1994) was an American guitarist renowned for his extraordinary technical skill and genre-blending style. Born in Washington, D.C., Gatton was the son of a rhythm guitarist and began playing guitar at age nine, drawing early inspiration from players like Les Paul and Hank Garland. He started his musical journey with the Offbeats in the early 1960s, later working as a session musician in Nashville and performing with local D.C. bands throughout the 1970s.

Gatton developed a unique sound he called 'redneck jazz,' fusing blues, rockabilly, jazz, and country into a virtuosic, eclectic style that defied easy categorization. He recorded his debut album, 'American Music,' in 1975, followed by the influential 'Redneck Jazz' in 1978, and continued to release acclaimed albums such as 'Unfinished Business' and '88 Elmira St.'—the latter earning him a Grammy nomination. Despite his technical brilliance and the admiration of fellow musicians, Gatton struggled to achieve mainstream fame, often referred to as 'the world's greatest unknown guitarist.'

Throughout his career, Gatton collaborated with notable artists including Roger Miller, Robert Gordon, and pedal steel legend Buddy Emmons. His influence extended far beyond his own recordings, inspiring a generation of guitarists with his versatility and innovation. Tragically, Gatton's life ended by suicide in 1994, but his legacy endures among musicians and aficionados who continue to celebrate his remarkable contributions to American music.
