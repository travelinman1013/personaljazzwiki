# Nat Adderley

## Biography
Nathaniel Carlyle Adderley was born on November 25, 1931, in Tampa, Florida, and became a prominent jazz cornetist and composer.[3] He initially took up trumpet as a teenager in 1946 and played in local Florida bands, but made a career-defining switch to the cornet in 1950, reviving an instrument that had fallen out of fashion in favor of trumpet during the bebop era.[1] After military service in the U.S. Army band from 1951 to 1953, he played with vibraphonist Lionel Hampton's big band from 1954 to 1955 and made his recording debut in 1955 on the Savoy and EmArcy labels.[1]

Adderley's most significant work came through his partnership with his older brother, saxophonist Julian "Cannonball" Adderley. After an initial collaboration in Cannonball's first quintet (1956–1957), Nat reunited with his brother in 1959 to form the Cannonball Adderley Quintet, which became a major success in the hard bop and soul jazz circuit.[1][3] The group's funky, gospel-tinged sound even produced an unexpected chart hit with "Mercy, Mercy, Mercy" in 1966.[1] Nat's warm, lyric improvising style complemented his brother's flaring alto saxophone solos, and he contributed original compositions including "Work Song" (1960), "Jive Samba," and "Sermonette," which became standards and hits for the group.[3] He remained with the quintet until Cannonball's death in 1975, after which he temporarily retired before leading his own groups from 1976 onward.[3]

Adderley was known for his distinctive cornet tone that blended rich warmth with the instrument's inherent astringency, and he was particularly skilled at playing solos that utilized the subtone register of his horn.[2] He played on nearly 100 albums as a leader and sideman and was beloved by both audiences for his good-humored presentation and fellow musicians for his musicianship.[3] Diabetes led to the amputation of a leg in 1997, effectively ending his performing career. He died on January 2, 2000, in Lakeland, Florida.[3]

## Fun Facts
- Before becoming a cornetist, Nat Adderley began his musical career as a boy soprano singer in Tallahassee, Florida, and made his musical debut at the Edgewood Club singing before his voice changed at age 12.[4]
- Nat's composition 'Work Song' (1960) became a jazz standard and later achieved pop chart success when singer Oscar Brown Jr. wrote lyrics for it, introducing the tune to a broader audience.[5]
- Nat and his brother Cannonball collaborated on a musical about John Henry, the legendary African American railroad worker, which was originally recorded as 'Big Man' (1975) and later staged as 'Shout Up a Morning' (1986).[3]
- Despite the cornet being considered an outdated instrument by the bebop era, Nat Adderley evolved such a distinctive signature sound on the cornet that he helped revive interest in the instrument, blending rich tone and earthy warmth with the horn's inherent astringency.[1]
