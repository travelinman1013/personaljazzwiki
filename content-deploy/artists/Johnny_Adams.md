## Biography
Johnny Adams, born Laten John Adams on January 5, 1932, in New Orleans, Louisiana, was the eldest of ten children in a deeply religious family. He left school at age 15 and began his musical journey singing gospel with local groups such as the Soul Revivers and Bessie Griffin & The Consolators. Adams quickly became known for his expressive, wide-ranging voice, earning the nickname 'The Tan Canary.'

Adams transitioned to secular music in 1959, releasing his first single 'I Won't Cry,' produced by Mac Rebennack (later known as Dr. John), which became a local hit. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, he recorded for various labels, scoring R&B hits like 'Release Me' and 'Reconsider Me,' the latter reaching the R&B Top 10 and Pop Top 30 in 1969. Despite never achieving national stardom, Adams was a fixture in the New Orleans music scene, celebrated for his ability to blend gospel, blues, soul, jazz, and country. His later career saw a resurgence with critically acclaimed albums for Rounder Records, including tributes to songwriters like Doc Pomus and genre explorations such as 'Good Morning Heartache.'

Adams' legacy lies in his vocal virtuosity and versatility, influencing a broad spectrum of artists across genres. He remained active until his death from cancer on September 14, 1998, in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, leaving behind a body of work revered by peers and fans alike.
