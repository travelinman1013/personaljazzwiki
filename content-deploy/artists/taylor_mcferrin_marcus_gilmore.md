## Biography
Taylor McFerrin, born June 28, 1981, in San Francisco, California, is an American DJ, music producer, keyboardist, and beatboxer, best known as the eldest son of renowned vocalist and conductor Bobby McFerrin. Growing up in San Francisco surrounded by jazz influences, he developed a genre-defying style blending jazz, hip-hop, electronica, and 1970s synth sounds reminiscent of Roy Ayers, Stevie Wonder, Herbie Hancock, and George Duke. After living in Brooklyn for 15 years where he honed his solo career, McFerrin signed with Flying Lotus's Brainfeeder label, releasing his debut album Early Riser in 2014, featuring guests like Thundercat, Robert Glasper, and his father Bobby McFerrin.[1][4]

McFerrin's career advanced through key collaborations, particularly his five-year duo partnership with drummer Marcus Gilmore, with whom he performed new compositions and explored improvisational blends of jazz, hip-hop beats, and electronic textures, as seen in their 2015 Vienna JazzFest performance. He joined Robert Glasper's supergroup R+R=Now in 2018 alongside Christian Scott, Terrace Martin, and Derrick Hodge, releasing Collagically Speaking on Blue Note Records. Relocating to Los Angeles three years prior to 2019 to tap into the beat scene, McFerrin continues to push boundaries, disavowing strict genres like his father while maintaining strong jazz credentials.[1][3][4][5]

His musical legacy lies in bridging past and future sounds, contributing to a revitalization of jazz through modern fusions that incorporate Black musical consciousness and innovative electronics, influencing a new generation alongside peers like Glasper and Thundercat.[1][2]
