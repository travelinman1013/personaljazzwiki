## Biography
Carlo Nuccio was a renowned drummer and singer-songwriter born in 1961 in New Orleans, Louisiana. Raised in the vibrant musical environment of New Orleans and the suburb of Old Jefferson, Nuccio was immersed in rhythm from an early age, influenced by his father's businesses and his own early experiences with tap dancing.

Nuccio's career spanned several decades and included significant time on both the New Orleans and Los Angeles music circuits. He was celebrated for his unique drumming style, which combined a deep respect for the fundamentals with an ability to blend into and elevate a wide variety of musical settings. Nuccio played with notable bands such as the Continental Drifters and worked alongside artists like Alex McMurray, John Mooney, and Benny Grunch.

Beyond performance, he contributed as a recording engineer and studio owner, further shaping the sound of the region.

Nuccio's legacy is marked by his versatility, empathy for songwriters, and commitment to the sacredness of music. He passed away in 2022 at the age of 61, leaving behind a profound influence on the New Orleans music community and all who played with him.
