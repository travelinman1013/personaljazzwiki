## Biography
Charles Bradley, known as the 'Screaming Eagle of Soul,' was born on November 5, 1948, in Gainesville, Florida, and raised initially by his grandmother until age eight, when his mother took him to Brooklyn, New York.[1][3][4][6] His early life was marked by hardship; after his bandmates were drafted into the Vietnam War, he hitchhiked across the U.S., living in places like upstate New York, Seattle, Canada, Alaska, and settling in California from 1977 to 1994, where he worked odd jobs and performed as a James Brown impersonator under names like James Brown Jr. and Black Velvet.[1][3][4] Returning to Brooklyn in 1996 at his mother's request due to her illness, he continued performing as Black Velvet while facing tragedies, including his brother's murder and a near-fatal allergic reaction to penicillin.[3][4][5]

Discovered in 2002 by Daptone Records co-founder Gabriel Roth while performing as Black Velvet, Bradley was introduced to guitarist Tom Brenneck, who became his key producer and collaborator.[3][4][5] At age 62, he released his debut album *No Time for Dreaming* in 2011, backed by the Menahan Street Band, featuring signature tracks like 'The World (Is Going Up in Flames)' and drawing from his life's struggles in soulful, raw performances.[1][3][4][5] Followed by *Victim of Love* (2013), *Changes* (2016, dedicated to his late mother), and the posthumous *Black Velvet* (2018), his retro soul style—blending vintage R&B, funk, and personal pain—earned critical acclaim, festival appearances at Coachella and Glastonbury, and late-life success akin to labelmate Sharon Jones.[1][3][5] Bradley passed away on September 23, 2017, from cancer, leaving a legacy of transcendent soul music that channeled adversity into universal love.[5][7]

Bradley evolved from James Brown tributes to original material reflecting his trials, mesmerizing audiences with high-energy live shows alongside his band the Extraordinaries and Daptone crew, solidifying his place in the 2010s soul revival.[3][5]
