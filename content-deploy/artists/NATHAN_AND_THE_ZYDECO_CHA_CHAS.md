## Biography
Nathan Williams Sr., born March 24, 1963, in St. Martinville, Louisiana, is a celebrated zydeco accordionist, singer, and songwriter who founded Nathan & the Zydeco Cha Chas in 1985. Raised in a French Creole-speaking, Catholic household as the youngest of seven children, Williams was immersed in Louisiana’s rich folk and zydeco traditions from an early age. After losing his father at age seven, he found inspiration in zydeco pioneers like Clifton Chenier, often listening from outside local clubs when too young to enter. Williams moved to Lafayette at 13 to live with his brother Sid, working in the family grocery store and, during a period of illness, secretly teaching himself the accordion—his first instrument was purchased from Buckwheat Zydeco.

Williams’ professional career began at 21, recording singles for his brother’s El Sid label and performing regularly at El-Sid-O’s in Lafayette. His big break came when Buckwheat Zydeco recommended him to Rounder Records, leading to a recording contract and the formation of the Zydeco Cha Chas. The band, a family-centered ensemble, debuted at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival in 1988 and quickly gained acclaim for their energetic performances and innovative blend of zydeco, jazz, blues, and R&B. Williams writes most of the band’s original material, and the group has toured extensively, performing at major venues and festivals worldwide, including the Lincoln Center, the Grand Ole Opry, and the 1996 Summer Olympics. Nathan & the Zydeco Cha Chas were inducted into the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame in 2005 and have received numerous awards, including a Grammy nomination in 2023 for their album 'Lucky Man.'

Over more than three decades, the band has been a cornerstone of zydeco music, both preserving its Creole roots and expanding its reach. Williams’ collaborations, such as with Cajun fiddler Michael Doucet on the 1995 album 'Creole Crossroads,' have helped bridge zydeco and Cajun traditions. The group’s international tours and family legacy—featuring multiple generations of Williams musicians—have solidified their reputation as ambassadors of Louisiana’s musical heritage.
