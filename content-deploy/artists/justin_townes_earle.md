## Biography
Justin Townes Earle (January 4, 1982 – August 20, 2020) was an American singer-songwriter and musician who emerged as a leading figure in the Americana and roots music movements of the late 2000s and early 2010s.[1] Born in Nashville to Steve Earle and Carol-Ann Hunter, Justin initially avoided music during his turbulent childhood, which he described as "absolute mayhem." His musical awakening came through an unexpected discovery: hearing Nirvana's "Where Did You Sleep Last Night?" through his bedroom door, which his father revealed was actually a Leadbelly composition. This revelation sparked a profound transformation, leading Justin to pursue an apprenticeship in old-timey string-band music in eastern Tennessee, followed by a blues apprenticeship in Chicago. However, his early years were marked by struggles with addiction, including heroin use, which temporarily derailed his musical ambitions before he achieved sobriety and redirected his energy toward songwriting.[2]

Over his 13-year solo career, Earle released eight full-length albums and one EP, establishing himself as a distinctive voice in American roots music.[1] His debut album, *The Good Life* (2008), introduced his signature sound—a soulfully wise yet punkishly ragged blend of finger-picked guitar inspired by bluesmen like Mance Lipscomb and Lightnin' Hopkins.[2] His breakthrough came with *Midnight at the Movies* (2009) and *Harlem River Blues* (2011), the latter earning Song of the Year at the Americana Awards in 2011, while he was named Emerging Artist of the Year in 2009.[1] Earle's subsequent albums explored diverse musical territories, incorporating folk, gospel, soul, and country-blues influences while addressing deeply personal themes of family relationships, addiction, forgiveness, and redemption. His final album, *The Saint of Lost Causes* (2019), marked a significant artistic evolution, shifting from introspective songwriting to socio-political character sketches and social commentary in the tradition of Bruce Springsteen.[3]

Earle was renowned for his electrifying live performances and his deliberate artistic independence from his father's legacy, consciously forging his own musical identity while drawing from his deep Southern roots.[2] He performed on major festival stages including Bonnaroo and made regular television appearances, collaborating with artists ranging from John Prine to Levon Helm to Gillian Welch.[1] His music was characterized by unsparing honesty about the human condition's vulnerabilities and frailties, earning him recognition as a central figure in the next generation of Americana artists. Earle passed away on August 20, 2020, from an accidental drug overdose.[6]

## Fun Facts
- Justin's name itself is a tribute to Townes Van Zandt, embedded in his middle name, reflecting his father's musical lineage and the deep roots of his artistic heritage.[2]
- His musical awakening came through Nirvana's cover of "Where Did You Sleep Last Night?"; when his father revealed it was originally a Leadbelly song and played him the original recording, Justin described it as "like getting a bomb dropped on you" that completely changed his world.[2]
- Before pursuing music seriously, Justin abandoned Nashville and high school after his first public performance as an opening act for Scotty Melton, instead spending years in eastern Tennessee and Chicago undergoing apprenticeships in old-timey string-band music and blues.[2]
- Despite being the son of country-rock legend Steve Earle, Justin made a conscious artistic decision not to play his father's music, deliberately forging his own identity in the shadow of a famous parent, similar to his friend Bobby Bare Jr.[2]
