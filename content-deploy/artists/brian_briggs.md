## Biography
Brian Briggs is a British musician and ornithologist best known as the lead singer, guitarist, and principal songwriter of the indie-folk band Stornoway. Born in the late 1970s, Briggs grew up with a deep appreciation for nature, which later became a defining element of his music. He studied Biological Sciences at Worcester College, Oxford, graduating in 2001, and pursued a doctorate in wildfowl conservation at Wolfson College. It was during his time at Oxford that he met Jon Ouin, with whom he would form Stornoway in 2006.

Stornoway quickly gained recognition for their melodic, nature-inspired sound, blending folk, pop, and indie influences. The band released their debut album, 'Beachcomber's Windowsill,' in 2010, which entered the UK Albums Chart at number 14 and won Album of the Year at the XFM New Music Awards. Briggs's songwriting is characterized by vivid imagery drawn from his experiences in the natural world, often incorporating birdsong and environmental themes. After three albums and extensive touring, Stornoway went on hiatus in 2017, prompting Briggs to focus on his parallel career in wildlife conservation as a senior reserve warden in Wales. The band reunited in 2022, releasing a fourth album, 'Dig the Mountain,' in 2023.

Briggs's dual passions for music and ecology have made him a unique figure in the British music scene, celebrated for his ability to bridge scientific insight and artistic expression. His legacy lies in both his contributions to indie-folk music and his advocacy for wildlife conservation, inspiring audiences to appreciate the beauty of the natural world through song.
