## Biography
SBTRKT & Jesse Ware refers to the collaborative project between British electronic producer SBTRKT (Aaron Jerome) and singer-songwriter Jessie Ware (Jessica Lois Ware, born 15 October 1984 in South London, England). Their partnership began in 2010 when Ware, a South London native educated at Alleyn's School in Dulwich and the University of Sussex (where she earned a degree in English literature), was introduced to SBTRKT by a bandmate of her school friend Jack Peñate during a U.S. tour. Initially pursuing journalism at The Jewish Chronicle and The Daily Mirror, Ware had sung backing vocals for Peñate and others, but the meeting with SBTRKT, who lived nearby in Tooting, led to their first collaboration on the track 'Nervous,' marking a pivotal shift toward her music career.[1][2][3]

Their collaboration exemplified a fusion of SBTRKT's post-dubstep, broken beat, and electronic production with Ware's soulful, powerful vocals influenced by her mother's Frank Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald records, alongside classical training from school musicals. 'Nervous' appeared on SBTRKT's self-titled debut album in 2011, alongside Ware's contributions to tracks like 'Sanctuary' (featuring Sampha). This partnership propelled Ware to sign with PMR Records, leading to her solo debut Devotion (2012), which peaked at number five on the UK Albums Chart and earned a Mercury Prize nomination. SBTRKT's innovative style blended UK garage, dubstep, and R&B, helping define early 2010s electronic soul.[2][3][5]

Though not a sustained duo act, their work left a legacy in electronic and alternative R&B, influencing Ware's trajectory with subsequent albums like Tough Love (2014) and That! Feels Good! (2023, Mercury Prize shortlist). SBTRKT continued producing, while Ware expanded into podcasting (Table Manners with her mother) and judging roles on shows like RuPaul's Drag Race UK. Their collaboration highlighted South London's vibrant music scene and bridged underground electronic production with mainstream soul appeal.[3]
