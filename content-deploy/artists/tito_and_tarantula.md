## Biography
Tito & Tarantula is a Chicano rock and blues rock band formed in Hollywood, California, in 1992 by singer, songwriter, and guitarist Tito Larriva, who was born in Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, spent early years near Fairbanks, Alaska, and later lived in El Paso, Texas, where he studied violin and flute in his school orchestra.[1][2] After high school, Larriva moved to Los Angeles in the mid-1970s, founding the seminal punk band the Plugz, which released their debut album Electrify Me in 1979 and scored the film Repo Man; the group later became Cruzados, releasing albums in 1985 and 1987 before disbanding in 1988 or 1990.[1][2] Larriva then pursued film music and acting, forming Tito & Tarantula with guitarist Peter Atanasoff through weekly jam sessions initially called 'Tito & Friends,' solidifying the lineup by 1995 with members including Jennifer Condos on bass and Nick Vincent on drums.[1][2]

The band's breakthrough came through collaborations with filmmaker Robert Rodriguez, contributing to Desperado and performing in From Dusk Till Dawn as the Titty Twister band, with songs like 'After Dark' gaining fame; their debut album Tarantism followed in 1997 on their Cockroach label, produced with Rodriguez's help.[1][2] Subsequent releases included Hungry Sally and Other Killer Lullabies (1999), Little Bitch (2000), Andalucia (2002), and Back Into The Darkness (2008), blending Chicano rock, stoner rock, punk roots, and blues influences amid frequent lineup changes, such as departures of Atanasoff, Johnny 'Vatos' Hernandez, and others, replaced by members like Dominique Davalos and Steven Hufsteter.[1][2] The band has toured extensively in Europe and contributed to films like Fred Claus, Somebody to Love, and Roadhouse via prior work.[1][2]

Tito & Tarantula's style evolved from Larriva's punk origins to a bluesier Latin rock sound, maintaining a cult following through film ties and live performances while active since 1992.[1][2]
