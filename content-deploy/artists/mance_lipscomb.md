## Biography
Mance Lipscomb, born Beau De Glen Lipscomb on April 9, 1895, near Navasota, Texas, was the son of a father born into slavery and a mother of African American and Native American descent[1][2][6]. His early life was marked by hardship; after his father left, Lipscomb left school after third grade to work the fields with his mother. At age fourteen, his mother bought him a guitar, and he taught himself to play by watching and listening to others, developing a distinctive 'dead-thumb' fingerpicking style[1][3].

For decades, Lipscomb supported himself as a tenant farmer, playing music locally at 'Saturday night suppers' and community gatherings, rarely venturing beyond his 'precinct' in East Texas[1][2][3]. He considered himself a 'songster' rather than strictly a bluesman, with a repertoire spanning blues, ragtime, Tin Pan Alley, folk, ballads, waltzes, polkas, and hymns—over 350 songs in total[3]. Lipscomb was discovered in 1960 by Mack McCormick and Chris Strachwitz during the folk-blues revival, leading to his first recordings for Arhoolie Records and national recognition[1][3].

Lipscomb became a celebrated figure in the American folk revival, performing at major festivals such as the Monterey Folk Festival and collaborating with artists like Willie Nelson, Pete Seeger, and the Grateful Dead[3]. His expressive voice, intricate guitar work, and storytelling made him a beloved performer and 'country sage.' His life and music are documented in his oral autobiography 'I Say Me for a Parable' and the documentary 'A Well Spent Life.' Lipscomb died in Navasota in 1976, leaving a legacy as a bridge between generations and cultures in American roots music[1][3][2].
