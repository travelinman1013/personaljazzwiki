## Biography
Larry Goldings, born August 28, 1968 in Boston, Massachusetts, is a Grammy-nominated American jazz pianist, organist, and composer celebrated for his innovative work in jazz and beyond[1][2][9]. Originally trained as a pianist, Goldings was deeply influenced by the expressive communication of jazz trios, which inspired him to form his own group. His early years saw him drawn to the piano, but a pivotal moment came when he began playing the Hammond B-3 organ during gigs in New York, eventually leading to the formation of his acclaimed trio[2][4].

The Larry Goldings Trio, most notably featuring guitarist Peter Bernstein and drummer Bill Stewart, emerged in the early 1990s and quickly gained recognition for their synergistic interplay and thoughtful approach to jazz standards and original compositions[1][3][4][6]. Their debut album, 'Intimacy of the Blues' (1991), marked the beginning of a partnership that has lasted over three decades, with the trio hailed by The New York Times as 'the best organ trio of the last decade'[3][6]. Goldings' style blends elements of jazz, funk, and soul, characterized by subtlety, groove, and a deep sense of musical conversation among the trio members.

Beyond his trio, Goldings has worked extensively as a sideman and collaborator, recording and touring with artists such as James Taylor, John Scofield, and Jack DeJohnette[3][4][10]. His legacy is defined by his versatility, inventive arrangements, and his role in revitalizing the organ trio format for contemporary audiences. The trio's influence extends through their numerous recordings and live performances, which continue to set a high standard in modern jazz.
