## Biography
Ed Calle is a Venezuelan-born saxophonist, flutist, and keyboardist known for his work in jazz and Latin rhythms, while Arturo Sandoval is a renowned Cuban-American jazz trumpeter, pianist, timbalero, and composer influenced by jazz during his time in Cuba. Jim Gasior is a composer and arranger who has collaborated in Latin jazz projects. The trio 'Ed Calle, Arturo Sandoval & Jim Gasior' appears as a collaborative entity, notably on the track 'Jingle Bells' in a Christmas music compilation, blending their expertise in **latin jazz** and **big band** styles.[3][4][9][6]

Their careers intersect in Miami's vibrant music scene, with Calle performing and recording alongside Sandoval, including contributions to Sandoval's projects like the three-time Latin Grammy-winning CD *A Time for Love*, where arrangements were featured.
