## Biography
There appears to be confusion regarding "Trio Jogral" as a distinct musical entity. The search results do not identify an artist or group by this exact name. However, the results extensively document Trio Mocotó, a legendary Brazilian band that was formed in 1968 at the Jogral nightclub in São Paulo. The Jogral was a renowned nightclub that served as a meeting point for Brazilian music, where Fritz Escovão, João Parahyba, and Nereu Gargalo worked as contracted musicians and support band members for major artists including Clementina de Jesus, Nelson Cavaquinho, Cartola, and Paulo Vanzolini. It is possible that "Trio Jogral" refers to Trio Mocotó, named after the nightclub where they originated, or that the query contains a naming discrepancy.

Trio Mocotó became instrumental in defining Brazilian black music during the 1970s through their innovative fusion of samba, rock, funk, and soul. The group gained prominence as backing musicians for Jorge Ben, appearing on seminal albums including Força Bruta, Negro É Lindo, and A Tábua de Esmeralda in 1969. They recorded influential solo albums such as Muita Zorra (1971), Trio Mocotó (1973), and The Brazilian Sound (1977), establishing themselves as creators of the samba-rock sound. After a hiatus of more than twenty years, they reformed in 2000 and returned to recording with Samba Rock (2001) and Beleza, Beleza, Beleza! (2003), touring extensively throughout Europe and Japan with renewed energy.
