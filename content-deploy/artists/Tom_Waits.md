## Biography
Tom Waits, born Thomas Alan Waits on December 7, 1949, in Pomona, California, is a singular figure in American music, renowned for his gravelly voice, poetic lyricism, and genre-defying sound. Raised in a middle-class family, Waits was drawn early to the bohemian world depicted in Beat literature, which profoundly shaped his artistic sensibility. He began performing in the late 1960s in Los Angeles clubs, developing a style that fused jazz, blues, folk, and avant-garde influences, often accompanied by his own piano and guitar playing. His early work, especially albums like 'Closing Time' (1973) and 'The Heart of Saturday Night' (1974), showcased a softer, jazz-inflected approach and established his reputation as a gifted songwriter, though commercial success initially eluded him.

In the 1980s, Waits underwent a dramatic artistic transformation, embracing experimental sounds and unconventional instrumentation, beginning with 'Swordfishtrombones' (1983). This period, coinciding with his marriage to Kathleen Brennan, saw him pushing boundaries with albums such as 'Rain Dogs' (1985) and 'Bone Machine' (1992), blending vaudeville, blues, and industrial noise into a distinctive sonic palette. Waits's lyrics, often populated by drifters and dreamers, evoke the underbelly of American life, earning him a devoted cult following and critical acclaim. His influence extends beyond music into acting and composing for film and theater, and he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2011.

Waits's legacy is marked by his refusal to conform to mainstream trends, inspiring generations of musicians with his originality and authenticity. Despite limited radio play, his songs have been widely covered by artists such as the Eagles and Rod Stewart, and his innovative approach has left an indelible mark on the landscape of contemporary music.
