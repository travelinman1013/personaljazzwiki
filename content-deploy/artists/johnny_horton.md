## Biography
John LaGale 'Johnny' Horton was born on April 30, 1925, in Los Angeles, California, the youngest of five children to sharecropping parents John Loly Horton and Ella Claudia Robinson. His family frequently migrated between Southern California and East Texas for farm work, with Horton raised primarily in areas like Rusk, Tyler, and Gallatin, Texas. Taught guitar by his mother, he graduated high school in 1944 and briefly pursued studies at institutions including Lon Morris Junior College on a basketball scholarship, Seattle University, and Baylor University, while also considering the ministry and working odd jobs like gold prospecting in Alaska and fishing. In 1950, he won a talent contest in East Texas hosted by an emerging Jim Reeves, sparking his music career as the 'Singing Fisherman,' with early radio appearances in California.[1][2][3]

Horton relocated to Shreveport, Louisiana, in 1952 for a regular spot on the Louisiana Hayride, signing with Mercury Records and forming bands like the Rowley Trio (later Roadrunners) featuring Jerry Rowley on fiddle, Evelyn Rowley on piano, and Vera Rowley on guitar. Managed initially by Fabor Robison (who started Abbott Records for him), he recorded for labels like Abbott, Dot, and Mercury without major hits, married and divorced Donna Cook, then wed Billie Jean Jones (widow of Hank Williams) in 1953. In 1955, Tillman Franks became his manager, securing a Columbia Records deal in 1956; influenced by Elvis Presley, Horton shifted to rockabilly and honky tonk, scoring top 10 country hits like 'Honky Tonk Man,' 'I'm a One-Woman Man,' and 'When It's Springtime in Alaska (It's Forty Below)' in 1959, followed by the massive #1 'The Battle of New Orleans' in 1959, blending classic country, storytelling sagas, and rockabilly energy.[1][2][4]

At the peak of his fame, Horton died tragically on November 5, 1960, at age 35 in a car crash near Milano, Texas, caused by a drunk driver swerving into his path after a performance. His legacy endures through narrative-driven hits that popularized historical country songs, earning induction into halls of fame and influencing the genre's crossover appeal, with genres spanning classic country, honky tonk, and rockabilly.[1][3]
