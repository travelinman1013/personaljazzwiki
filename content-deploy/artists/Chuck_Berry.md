## Biography
Charles Edward Anderson Berry was born on October 18, 1926, in St. Louis, Missouri, the youngest child of Henry William Berry, a contractor and Baptist church deacon, and Martha Bell Berry, a certified public school principal. He grew up in the Ville, a middle-class African American neighborhood where his family's stability allowed him to pursue music from an early age. Berry gave his first public performance in 1941 at Sumner High School, performing "Confessin' the Blues" by Jay McShann to thunderous applause. His early life was marked by a significant setback when he was arrested in 1944 for armed robbery and sent to the Intermediate Reformatory for Young Men in Jefferson City, Missouri, where he formed a singing quartet. He was released on his 21st birthday in 1947, married Themetta "Toddy" Suggs in 1948, and worked various jobs including factory work and training as a beautician at the Poro College of Cosmetology to support his family.

By the early 1950s, Berry was performing with local bands in St. Louis clubs, combining his love for blues, country, and the smooth vocal style of his idol Nat King Cole. He began his long-time collaboration with pianist Johnnie Johnson's trio in early 1953, developing a unique style that mixed country tunes with R&B, creating what audiences called "black hillbilly" music. His breakthrough came in 1955 when Muddy Waters directed him to Chess Records in Chicago, where his first recording "Maybellene" stayed on the pop charts for 11 weeks and reached number five. Berry then produced a remarkable string of hits including "Roll Over Beethoven" (1956), "School Day" (1957), "Rock and Roll Music" (1957), "Sweet Little Sixteen" (1958), and "Johnny B. Goode" (1958), establishing himself as a pioneer of rock and roll.

Berry's musical style was revolutionary, combining blues guitar riffs borrowed from T-Bone Walker with country-western influences and vivid descriptions of teenage life and consumer culture. His distinctive guitar sound, rhythmic virtuosity, and showmanship techniques made his songs staples in the repertoire of virtually every rock and roll band that followed. Berry's ability to appeal to both black and white audiences in the highly segregated 1950s America was unique and groundbreaking, helping to break down racial barriers in popular music. His influence on rock and roll is immeasurable, with his guitar style, songwriting, and performance techniques becoming foundational elements of the genre.

## Fun Facts
- Berry's first public performance at Sumner High School in 1941 featured "Confessin' the Blues" by Jay McShann, a daring choice since blues was well-liked but not considered appropriate for school events. He received thunderous applause and from then on, his only wish was to be on stage.
- Berry developed a unique "black hillbilly" style by mixing country tunes with R&B for predominantly black audiences at the Cosmopolitan Club. After initial laughter, audiences began requesting the hillbilly stuff and enjoyed dancing to it, making him popular with both black and white audiences in the segregated 1950s.
- While at the Intermediate Reformatory for Young Men from 1944 to 1947, Berry formed a singing quartet that became competent enough that authorities allowed it to perform outside the detention facility.
- Berry attended Sumner High School, the first black high school west of the Mississippi, whose notable alumni also include Tina Turner, Dick Gregory, and Arthur Ashe. He was trained as a beautician at the Poro College of Cosmetology, founded by Annie Turnbo Malone, and worked various jobs including as a factory worker and janitor before his music career took off.
