## Biography
Alabama Shakes are an American rock band from Athens, Alabama, formed in 2009 by singer‑guitarist Brittany Howard, bassist Zac Cockrell, and drummer Steve Johnson, later joined by guitarist Heath Fogg.[1][2][3] Howard and Cockrell first met in a high‑school psychology class in nearby Limestone County and began writing songs after school, drawing on everything from roots music and soul to punk and classic rock.[1][2][3] They started out playing covers by artists such as Otis Redding and Led Zeppelin alongside their originals at local bars and house parties, gradually shaping a sound built around Howard’s raw, gospel‑inflected voice and the band’s live‑to‑tape, garage‑soul energy.[1][2][3]

Performing initially as “The Shakes,” the group built a regional following around the southeastern United States before a homemade demo of “You Ain’t Alone” was posted by the influential blog Aquarium Drunkard in 2011, triggering a wave of industry attention and a deal with ATO Records.[1][2][3] Their debut album, *Boys & Girls* (2012), recorded largely live with producer Andrija Tokic in Nashville, earned critical acclaim and multiple Grammy nominations, firmly establishing them as one of the leading American roots‑rock bands of the decade.[1][2][3] The follow‑up, *Sound & Color* (2015), pushed further into psychedelic soul, R&B, and experimental rock textures and went on to win three Grammy Awards, including Best Alternative Music Album, while the band became known for electrifying festival and late‑night TV performances anchored by Howard’s commanding stage presence.[1][2][3]

After *Sound & Color*, Alabama Shakes entered a lengthy hiatus as Howard turned to a solo career, releasing her acclaimed album *Jaime* (2019), while other members worked on their own projects.[3] According to later reporting, Johnson left the group following legal issues, and the remaining members recorded as Sun on Shade before reuniting under the Alabama Shakes name when Howard, Fogg, and Cockrell announced a 2025 tour.[3][7] By the mid‑2020s, the band’s blend of roots rock, soul, blues, and psychedelia, together with Howard’s groundbreaking visibility as a queer, mixed‑race, female rock frontwoman, had cemented Alabama Shakes’ legacy as a pivotal act in the revival and reinvention of Southern American rock music.[3][4][6]

## Fun Facts
- The band initially performed simply as “The Shakes,” only adding “Alabama” after discovering how many other groups were already using the name; the change both avoided confusion and proudly highlighted their home state.[1][2]
- Their big break came when Los Angeles blogger and SiriusXM host Justin Gage found a photo of Brittany Howard online and decided to post the track “You Ain’t Alone” on his Aquarium Drunkard blog, leading to a flood of label offers literally overnight.[1][2][3]
- Alabama Shakes chose to record much of their debut album *Boys & Girls* live to tape at producer Andrija Tokic’s Bomb Shelter studio in Nashville, driving about an hour and a half from Athens to record in short bursts while still an unsigned bar band.[2]
- After Alabama Shakes went on hiatus, the non‑Howard members briefly continued together under the name Sun on Shade, releasing a self‑titled album in 2020 before later reuniting with Howard for an Alabama Shakes tour announcement.[3]

- [[elvis_presley_and_motown_artists|Elvis Presley and Motown artists]] - Early listening staples in Brittany Howard’s home, helping shape her love of vintage rock ’n’ roll, R&B, and soul vocal styles.[6] (Classic Elvis recordings and Motown catalog records frequently played in Howard’s childhood household.[6]) [Howard’s childhood and early teens (pre‑2007)]

- [[brittany_howard|Brittany Howard]] - Founding member, lead singer, primary songwriter, and guitarist of Alabama Shakes; central creative force whose vocals and writing define the band’s sound.[1][2][3] (Co‑writes and performs on *Boys & Girls* (2012) and *Sound & Color* (2015); leads live performances and later reunites with bandmates for the 2025 tour.[1][2][3][7]) [2009–2015; reunion announced for 2025]

### Artists Influenced
- [[younger_southern_rootsrock_and_soulinfluenced_indie_artists_general_category|Younger Southern roots‑rock and soul‑influenced indie artists (general category)]] - Alabama Shakes’ success demonstrated that a band from a small Alabama town, led by a queer, mixed‑race woman fronting a rock group, could achieve mainstream and Grammy‑level recognition, encouraging a wave of Southern artists blending soul, rock, and Americana. This influence is broadly acknowledged in music journalism but is not usually tied to specific individual protégés in primary reference sources. (Their genre‑defying albums *Boys & Girls* and *Sound & Color* are frequently cited in critical discussions of 2010s Americana and indie‑soul, inspiring subsequent acts to embrace raw live recording, vintage tones, and intersectional identities in rock.[1][2][3][4][6]) [Mid‑2010s onward]
