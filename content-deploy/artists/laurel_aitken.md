## Biography
Lorenzo "Laurel" Aitken was born on April 22, 1927, in Cuba to parents of mixed Cuban and Jamaican descent. When he was eleven years old, his family relocated to West Kingston, Jamaica in 1938, where he was exposed to rhythm and blues from New Orleans via US FM radio stations, as well as Caribbean calypso and mento traditions. These musical influences would form the foundation of his unique artistic voice. He initially worked for the Jamaican Tourist Board as an entertainer, performing mento songs for visitors at Kingston Harbour and later becoming a popular nightclub performer throughout Jamaica.

Aitken's recording career began in the late 1950s with mento-influenced tracks, and his 1958 single "Boogie in My Bones"/"Little Sheila"—produced by future Island Records founder Chris Blackwell—became one of the first Jamaican popular music records released in the United Kingdom. In 1960, he relocated to Brixton, London, where he recorded fifteen singles for the Blue Beat label before returning to Jamaica in 1963. Working with producer Duke Reid and backed by the Skatalites, he recorded influential ska tracks such as "Zion" and "Weary Wanderer." Upon his return to the UK, he recorded for Pama Records, achieving hits like "Fire in Mi Wire" and "Landlord and Tenants" that established him as a leading ska artist among both West Indian communities and British mods and skinheads.

Aitken's career spanned multiple genres including mento, calypso, R&B, ska, rocksteady, reggae, and even dancehall in the 1990s. He settled in Leicester with his wife in 1970, where his recording output slowed but he continued performing in local nightclubs and restaurants. In 1980, during the 2 Tone ska resurgence, he achieved his only UK Singles Chart success with "Rudi Got Married" (No. 60). Aitken earned the titles "Godfather of Ska" and "Boss Skinhead" for his pioneering contributions to the genre. He performed occasional concerts until his death from a heart attack on July 17, 2005, at age 78. In 2007, a blue plaque was installed at his Leicester home in recognition of his significant contributions to Jamaican and British music history.

## Fun Facts
- Aitken performed under the theatrical alter ego "King Horror," adopting various character personas such as "The Loch Ness Monster," "Dracula, Prince of Darkness," and "The Hole" during his performances.
- His 1958 recording "Boogie in My Bones" was not only one of the first records produced by Chris Blackwell but also the first Jamaican popular music record to be released in the United Kingdom, marking a significant milestone in Jamaican music's international expansion.
- After settling in Leicester in 1970, Aitken performed under his real name Lorenzo at the popular 'Costa Brava Restaurant,' working as an entertainer in local nightclubs and restaurants while maintaining a lower public profile.
- Despite his pioneering role in ska music, Aitken did not achieve his first and only UK Singles Chart entry until 1980 at age 53 with "Rudi Got Married" (No. 60), which coincided with the 2 Tone ska revival.
