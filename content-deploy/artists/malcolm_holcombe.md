## Biography
Malcolm Holcombe (1955–2024) was born in Weaverville, North Carolina, and raised in nearby Swannanoa, both nestled in the Appalachian region near Asheville. Growing up in western North Carolina, Holcombe was steeped in the area's deep musical traditions, which would profoundly influence his songwriting and performance style. After high school, he briefly attended technical school and college, but the pull of music soon led him to perform in local bands such as The Hilltoppers and Redwing, and to collaborate with regional songwriters.

In 1990, Holcombe moved to Nashville to pursue a career as a singer-songwriter, initially supporting himself as a cook and dishwasher at the Douglas Corner Cafe while performing at open mics. His raw, emotionally charged performances and intricate songwriting quickly earned him a reputation among Nashville’s music community. He released his first solo album, 'A Far Cry From Here,' in 1994, and was subsequently signed by Geffen Records, recording the acclaimed but initially shelved album 'A Hundred Lies' (eventually released in 1999). Disillusioned with the industry and battling personal demons, Holcombe returned to North Carolina, where he rebuilt his life and career, releasing a steady stream of albums on independent labels and becoming a revered figure in Americana, alt-country, and country blues circles.

Holcombe’s music is marked by its blend of folk, early country, and blues, characterized by his gravelly voice, percussive guitar style, and deeply empathetic lyrics that often reflect the struggles and dignity of working-class life. His songwriting drew comparisons to legends like Hank Williams and Townes Van Zandt, and his live performances were renowned for their intensity and authenticity. Over a career spanning three decades, Holcombe became a songwriter’s songwriter, influencing peers and younger artists alike, and leaving a legacy as one of the most honest and compelling voices in American roots music.
