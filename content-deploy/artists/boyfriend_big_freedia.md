Big Freedia, born Freddie Ross Jr., is a celebrated hip-hop artist and the undisputed 'Queen of New Orleans Bounce,' a genre rooted in the vibrant musical culture of New Orleans. Raised in the city’s 3rd Ward, Freedia began singing in church choirs before immersing herself in the local bounce scene in the late 1990s.

Freedia’s influence extends beyond music, as she starred in the reality series 'Big Freedia Bounces Back' and 'Big Freedia Means Business,' showcasing her journey as an artist and advocate for LGBTQ+ rights. Her memoir, 'God Save the Queen Diva,' further cements her legacy as a cultural icon and trailblazer for racial and gender equality.
