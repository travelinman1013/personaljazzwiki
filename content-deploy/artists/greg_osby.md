## Biography
Greg Osby is a trailblazing post-bop saxophonist, composer, and producer born on April 3, 1960, in St. Louis, Missouri.[3] He began his professional music career in 1975 after three years of private studies on clarinet, flute, and alto saxophone.[1] During his teenage years, Osby played in various R&B, funk, and blues units throughout St. Louis, demonstrating early versatility and earning money from weekend gigs that often exceeded his teachers' salaries.[4] After high school, he pursued formal jazz education at Howard University in Washington, D.C., and later studied at the Berklee College of Music in Boston from 1980 to 1982.[1]

Upon relocating to New York City in late 1982, Osby rapidly established himself as an in-demand sideman, performing alongside jazz luminaries including Herbie Hancock, Dizzy Gillespie, Jack DeJohnette, Andrew Hill, Freddie Hubbard, Muhal Richard Abrams, Woody Shaw, Jim Hall, and Chick Corea.[1] A pivotal moment in his career came in 1985 when he joined Jack DeJohnette's innovative group "Special Edition," which significantly advanced his compositional and performance conception.[1] Osby was also a founding member of the M-BASE Collective alongside Steve Coleman and others, a Brooklyn-based ensemble that helped redefine modern jazz through complex rhythms and innovative structures.[5] He made his solo debut in 1987 with "Sound Theatre" on the JMT label, recording four projects before signing with Blue Note Records in 1990, where he released fifteen outstanding recordings as a leader over a sixteen-year tenure.[1][2]

Recognized by The New York Times as one of the "most provocative musical thinkers of his generation," Osby is celebrated as an "iconoclast and stylistic alchemist" who transmutes free, funk, and bebop influences while exploring new jazz hybrids incorporating hip-hop, classical, and rock elements.[1][4] In 2007, he launched his own label, "Inner Circle Music," serving as a platform for contemporary artists.[1] Beyond his prolific recording career spanning over 39 years, Osby has devoted considerable time to educational activities and continues to be recognized internationally for his insightful approach to composition and performance.

## Fun Facts
- After just one year of clarinet instruction in seventh grade, Osby was proficient enough to perform in local funk and blues bands in St. Louis, eventually earning more money from weekend gigs than many of his music teachers.[4]
- Osby's 2002 album 'Inner Circle' featured a notable cover of Björk's 'All Neon Like,' demonstrating his willingness to reinterpret contemporary pop music through a jazz lens.[3]
- As a founding member of the M-BASE Collective, Osby was part of a Brooklyn-based movement that fundamentally redefined modern jazz by emphasizing complex rhythms and innovative structures, influencing the direction of contemporary jazz in the 1980s and beyond.[5]
- Osby is known for his strict, serious onstage manner and celebrated for the confident clarity and clipped angularity of his playing style, earning him recognition as an iconoclast who continuously shifts between different musical paths and explorations.[4]
