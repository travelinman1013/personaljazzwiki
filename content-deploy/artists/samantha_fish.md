## Biography
Samantha Fish, born January 30, 1989, in Kansas City, Missouri, is an acclaimed American guitarist, singer, and songwriter known for her dynamic presence in the modern blues scene. Raised in a musical family—her mother led a church choir and her father played guitar—Fish began her musical journey on the drums before switching to guitar at age 15. As a teenager, she immersed herself in Kansas City's vibrant blues culture, often sneaking into the Knuckleheads Saloon to watch and eventually sit in with touring musicians, which helped shape her distinctive style.[5][6]

Fish's career took off with her 2009 live album 'Live Bait,' recorded with the Samantha Fish Blues Band, which led to a contract with Ruf Records. She gained wider recognition with her 2011 solo debut 'Runaway,' earning the 2012 Blues Music Award for Best New Artist. Over the years, Fish has released a series of critically acclaimed albums, including 'Black Wind Howlin’,' 'Chills & Fever,' and the Grammy-nominated 'Death Wish Blues' with Jesse Dayton. Her music, while rooted in blues, incorporates elements of rock, country, funk, and Americana, showcasing her powerful vocals and virtuosic guitar work. Fish's relentless innovation and genre-blending approach have made her a leading figure in contemporary blues and a role model for aspiring musicians.[1][5][6]
