## Biography
Michael Ward (February 21, 1967 – April 1, 2024) was an American guitarist born in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He began his career as a founding member of the early 1990s alternative rock band School of Fish on Capitol Records, where his unique guitar tone underpinned the hit single '3 Strange Days.' Ward's innovative guitar approach attracted producers like Matt Wallace and Mark Endert, leading to over 50 studio album recordings across 35 years, including John Hiatt's *Perfectly Good Guitar* (1993) and Gavin DeGraw's *Chariot*.[1]

He later became a member of Ben Harper and the Innocent Criminals, playing on albums like *Both Sides of the Gun* (2006), *Lifeline* (2007), and *Call It What It Is* (2016), and collaborated with Ben Harper and The Blind Boys of Alabama on *There Will Be a Light*, winning an NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Gospel Artist. Ward toured over 50 countries and worked as a session musician and guitar instructor in Los Angeles.[1]
