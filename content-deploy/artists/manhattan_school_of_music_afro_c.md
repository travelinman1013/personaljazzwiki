# Manhattan School of Music Afro C

## Biography
The Manhattan School of Music Afro-Cuban Jazz Orchestra (MSM Afro-Cuban Jazz Orchestra) is a student big band ensemble at the Manhattan School of Music in New York City, specializing in **afro-cuban jazz**, **latin jazz**, and **big band** styles. Formed under the leadership of Grammy-winning percussionist, composer, and educator Bobby Sanabria, the orchestra has gained recognition for its masterful performances and recordings that revive the history of Latin jazz, particularly its roots in Harlem during the 1920s to 1950s. The group consists of talented MSM students and alumni who deliver professional-level execution, blending classic arrangements with modern soloing.[1][3][4]

Bobby Sanabria serves as the primary conductor and music director, drawing on his Puerto Rican heritage and deep knowledge of Afro-Cuban traditions to inspire the ensemble. Notable releases include *¡Que Viva Harlem!* (2014, Jazzheads), a tribute to Harlem's Latin jazz legacy featuring arrangements by Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn adapted for full Afro-Cuban percussion, and *Tito Puente Masterworks Live*. The orchestra has performed at venues like the John C. Borden Auditorium, earning ecstatic audience responses for its danceable, swaggering sound. At times, leadership has shifted, with Arturo O'Farrill, an MSM alumnus and faculty member, directing the group.[1][3][5][6]

The orchestra's style emphasizes the fusion of jazz orchestration with Afro-Cuban rhythms, showcasing arrangements from historic bands like Machito’s Afro-Cubans alongside originals. Its legacy lies in educating the next generation of musicians—many of whom aspire to the standards set by MSM alumni like Herbie Hancock and Ron Carter—while producing recordings that support the school's scholarship fund and preserve Latin jazz heritage.[1][3]

## Fun Facts
