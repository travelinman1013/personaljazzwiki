## Biography
Lawrence is an eight-piece soul-pop band formed by siblings Clyde and Gracie Lawrence in New York City. From a young age, the two were immersed in music, listening to records by Stevie Wonder, Randy Newman, and Aretha Franklin in their family’s apartment. Their early musical development was shaped by writing songs together and performing with friends from childhood and college, eventually solidifying into the current lineup of Lawrence, which features a dynamic, keyboard-driven sound, punchy horn section, and powerful vocals.[3][5]

The band debuted with the album 'Breakfast' in 2016, produced by Grammy-winner Eric Krasno and featuring guest performances from NYC soul/funk mainstays. Their sophomore album 'Living Room' (2018) reached #2 on the iTunes R&B/Soul chart and led to their late-night television debut. In 2019, Lawrence became the first band signed to Beautiful Mind Records, the label of Grammy-winning producer Jon Bellion, and supported Bellion on his Glory Sound Prep Tour. Their music blends classic soul and funk influences with contemporary pop energy, earning them a devoted following and critical acclaim for their high-energy live performances.[1][2][3][4][5]

In 2024, Lawrence released their fourth studio album, 'Family Business,' whose opening track 'Whatcha Want' broke into the US Pop Top 40. The band has performed at major venues and festivals worldwide, including Radio City Music Hall, The Wiltern, and North Sea Jazz Festival, and appeared on national TV programs such as The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon and The Kelly Clarkson Show. Lawrence’s legacy is marked by their infectious joy, musicianship, and ability to blend old-school soul with modern pop sensibilities.[3][5]
