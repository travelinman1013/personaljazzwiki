## Biography
Romare is the alias of British electronic producer and DJ Archie Fairhurst, known for his innovative approach to sampling and collage-based music. Raised by English parents who moved frequently across Asia, Fairhurst attended international schools before settling in England at age 19. He later studied African American Visual Culture at university, where he discovered the work of American artist Romare Bearden. Inspired by Bearden’s collage technique, Fairhurst adopted the name 'Romare' and began applying similar cut-and-paste aesthetics to music, using samples from second-hand records and weaving them with his own instrumentation.[1][3][5]

Romare’s career began in earnest with his breakout 2012 EP 'Meditations on Afrocentrism' on Black Acre, which explored the roots of blues and jazz in African music. He quickly gained recognition for his ability to blend genres and eras, releasing a series of acclaimed albums on Ninja Tune, including 'Projections' (2015), 'Love Songs: Part Two' (2016), and 'Home' (2020). His music is characterized by a patchwork of global influences, playful yet deeply researched, and always rooted in dance music. Romare’s live performances range from solo sets to full-band arrangements, reflecting his background as a guitarist and drummer.[3][5]

Romare’s legacy lies in his ability to dissolve musical boundaries, creating a timeless sound that connects past and present. By sourcing samples from overlooked vinyl and combining them with lo-fi instruments and personal recordings, he crafts tracks that are both nostalgic and forward-thinking. His work stands as a testament to the enduring power of collage, both in visual art and music, and continues to inspire listeners and producers alike.[1][3][5]
