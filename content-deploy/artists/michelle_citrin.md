## Biography
Michelle Citrin is an American singer, songwriter, producer, and multimedia artist best known for blending contemporary folk-pop with Jewish themes and humor. Born and raised in Fair Lawn, New Jersey, to an Israeli mother, she grew up in a culturally Jewish home but did not initially see herself as a “Jewish singer,” instead performing in mainstream New York City venues and developing her craft on the local acoustic circuit.[5] She later relocated to Brooklyn, New York, which she frequently cites as her artistic home base and where she built a reputation for intimate, soulful live shows and sharp, story-driven songwriting.[1][7]

Citrin’s career shifted significantly with the rise of YouTube and social media, where her witty, low-budget videos celebrating Jewish life unexpectedly went viral. Songs like “20 Things to Do with Matzah” and “Rosh Hashanah Girl” turned her into a pioneering figure in digital Jewish culture, drawing millions of views and leading to commissions and performances connected with Broadway and major Jewish organizations.[3][6] Working as a fully independent artist, she self-produced and sold thousands of copies of her EP *Foursongsforyou*, and she has been featured as a guest artist at synagogues, festivals, and concert stages across North America for her engaging performances and catchy, communal sing-along choruses.[2][4] Her work has helped redefine how Jewish identity can be expressed in contemporary pop-folk music, influencing the broader ecosystem of Jewish online content and independent Jewish singer‑songwriters.[3][6]

Artistically, Citrin is often described as a folk-pop storyteller with a warm, conversational vocal style, acoustic-guitar-driven arrangements, and lyrics that mix sincerity with gentle irony. She draws on personal narrative, spiritual searching, and everyday Jewish ritual, making them accessible to both Jewish and non-Jewish audiences through hook-focused songwriting and deft use of humor.[2][4][6] As one of the early artists to leverage viral video to share Jewish music worldwide, she occupies a distinctive place in the landscape of Jewish popular culture, credited by outlets like Jewish Rock Radio and The Forward with helping to normalize Jewish content in mainstream-leaning online entertainment while remaining entirely independent of major labels.[3][6]
