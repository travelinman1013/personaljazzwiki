## Biography
The Wild Magnolias are a legendary Mardi Gras Indian tribe and funk band originating from New Orleans, Louisiana. Their roots trace back to the 1950s, when they participated in the city's 'Indian masking' traditions, but their musical journey took a transformative turn in 1964 when Theodore Emile 'Bo' Dollis became Big Chief. Dollis, having previously participated in other Mardi Gras tribes, brought a new energy and vision to the group, steering them toward a fusion of traditional Mardi Gras Indian chants with contemporary funk and R&B influences.

The group achieved commercial recognition in the early 1970s with the release of their single 'Handa Wanda' and their self-titled debut album, which featured a powerhouse backing band including pianist Willie Tee and guitarist Snooks Eaglin. Their music, characterized by vibrant percussion, call-and-response vocals, and infectious rhythms, was groundbreaking in its blend of ancient Mardi Gras Indian street traditions with the electrifying sounds of funk. The Wild Magnolias became known for their exuberant live performances, sharing stages at prestigious venues like Carnegie Hall and the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, and collaborating with a range of New Orleans musical luminaries.

Despite challenges with record labels and lineup changes, The Wild Magnolias remained cultural ambassadors for New Orleans, reviving their career in the 1980s and 1990s with new recordings and international tours. The legacy of Bo Dollis, who led the group until his death in 2015, continues through his son, Bo Dollis Jr., who now serves as Big Chief. The Wild Magnolias are celebrated for both preserving and innovating Mardi Gras Indian music, influencing generations of musicians and expanding the reach of New Orleans' unique musical heritage.
