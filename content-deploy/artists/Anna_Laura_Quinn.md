## Biography
Anna Laura Quinn is a New Orleans-based jazz vocalist, arranger, and bandleader known for her sophisticated blend of American Songbook standards, French and Brazilian music, and contemporary interpretations delivered with what DownBeat described as "the inherent delight of [her] vocal timbre." Raised in San Francisco where she grew up listening to vocal jazz at home, Quinn was initially educated as a visual artist in New York City before moving to New Orleans in 2010, where the city's rich musical tradition profoundly shaped her artistic development.

Quinn earned her Master of Music in Jazz Studies from the University of New Orleans in 2021, studying alongside and performing with internationally renowned guest artists including Terence Blanchard, Kurt Elling, Ellis Marsalis, and Dr. Lonnie Smith. She made her debut at the 50th annual New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival with the UNO Jazz All-Stars in 2019. In February 2022, she released her first full-length album "Open the Door" on Outside In Music, which she produced and arranged entirely herself. The album received critical acclaim from JazzTimes, with critic Andrew Gilbert praising her work for "artfully threading the jazz needle" and "establishing her own winsome identity as a savvy vocalist and arranger with an appealing sound, unfailing taste, and expansive palette of influences."

Quinn is a dynamic presence on the New Orleans music scene, performing regularly at venerable jazz venues like Snug Harbor, Dos Jefes Uptown Cigar Bar, and the New Orleans Jazz Museum, as well as beloved barrooms including Saturn Bar, Vaughan's, and BJ's Lounge. In 2020, she founded the Unmentionables, a band that plays what she calls "New Orleans Getdown Music." Her artistic approach emphasizes improvisational essence, emotional sincerity, and humor, bringing what critics have called "new vitality to classic tunes" while maintaining deep respect for jazz tradition.
