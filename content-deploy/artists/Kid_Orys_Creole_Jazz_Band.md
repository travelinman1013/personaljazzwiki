## Biography
Kid Ory’s Creole Jazz Band was led by Edward 'Kid' Ory, born December 25, 1886, in LaPlace, Louisiana. Ory began his musical journey on homemade instruments and banjo before switching to trombone, developing a distinctive 'tailgate' style characterized by staccato phrases, glissandos, and growls. He formed his first group, the Woodland Band, in his youth, performing at local dances and parades. Ory moved to New Orleans in 1910, quickly establishing himself as a leading bandleader and collaborating with future jazz luminaries.

In 1919, Ory relocated to California, forming Kid Ory’s Creole Orchestra, which became the first Black New Orleans jazz band to make a recording in 1922 with 'Ory’s Creole Trombone.' This recording is recognized as a milestone in jazz history and was later selected for the National Recording Registry. Ory’s band played a pivotal role in the New Orleans jazz revival of the 1940s, and he continued to perform and record with major figures such as Louis Armstrong, King Oliver, and Jelly Roll Morton. After a brief hiatus during the Great Depression, Ory returned to prominence as the leader of the band on 'The Orson Welles Almanac' radio show in 1944, cementing his legacy as a foundational figure in traditional jazz.

Ory’s musical style was rooted in the ensemble-driven, danceable rhythms of early New Orleans jazz, with a focus on dynamic interplay and blues-infused melodies. His innovations in trombone technique influenced generations of jazz musicians, and his leadership brought together some of the most important early jazz artists. Ory retired in 1966 but made a final appearance at the 1971 New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival before passing away in 1973. His contributions are widely recognized as essential to the development and preservation of classic jazz.
