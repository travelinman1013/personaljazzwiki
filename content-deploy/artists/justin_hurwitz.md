## Biography
Justin Hurwitz, born January 22, 1985 in Los Angeles, California, is an acclaimed American film composer and television writer best known for his long-standing collaboration with director Damien Chazelle. Raised in a creative household—his mother was a ballet dancer and his father a writer—Hurwitz began piano lessons at age six and was composing music by ten. His family relocated to Wisconsin in 1998, where he attended Nicolet High School before enrolling at Harvard University. There, he joined the Harvard Lampoon and formed the indie-pop band Chester French with Chazelle, foreshadowing a partnership that would define his career.[1][4][8]

Hurwitz’s professional breakthrough came with the jazz-infused score for Chazelle’s debut feature, 'Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench' (2009), followed by the intense rhythms of 'Whiplash' (2014). His lush, melodic compositions for 'La La Land' (2016) earned him two Academy Awards, two Golden Globes, and a BAFTA, cementing his reputation as a leading voice in contemporary film music. Hurwitz is noted for his meticulous approach, personally orchestrating his scores and drawing inspiration from classic Hollywood musicals, jazz, and European film composers. His subsequent work on 'First Man' (2018) and 'Babylon' (2022) further showcased his versatility and commitment to musical storytelling.[1][2][5][6]

Hurwitz’s musical style is characterized by a blend of jazz, classical influences, and innovative orchestrations, often featuring memorable melodies and intricate harmonies. His legacy is closely tied to the resurgence of original film musicals in the 21st century, and his work continues to inspire both audiences and fellow composers.[1][4][5]
