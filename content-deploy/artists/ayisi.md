## Biography
Emmanuel Kwadwo Ayisi Oware, known professionally as Ayisi (formerly A.I.), was born on July 21, 1986, in Accra, Ghana. He began recording music during his high school days at Presbyterian Boys Secondary School in 2004, laying the foundation for his career in Afro-pop, Hip-Hop, R&B, and Ghanaian genres like hiplife and highlife.[3][4][5][6] Gaining local recognition for his authentic storytelling and versatility, Ayisi rose to prominence with singles such as 'Anger Management' (2014) and 'Grind' (2016), though widespread fame eluded him initially despite consistent output.[1][2]

Ayisi's career evolved with releases like the 2018 Headstrong EP and the 2019 joint project The Linkop with rapper E.L., culminating in his debut album The Unbroken in an unspecified recent year, featuring collaborations with Pure Akan, Efya, Obrafour, and Prince Bright.[1] After a decade of persistence, including a personal break for handling life matters while continuing to record, he achieved breakthrough success in 2025 by winning Record of the Year at the 26th Telecel Ghana Music Awards for 'Can I Live' (released 2022), which gained traction in 2024.[2] He founded A-Konnekt Music, reflecting his independent drive in an industry where he prioritized purpose over immediate fame.[4][8]

Ayisi's musical style blends Afro-pop, Hip-Hop, R&B with Ghanaian elements, emphasizing personal narratives and resilience, as evident in The Unbroken, which he views as a testament to his life's struggles and second chances.[1][3] His recent award win marks a turning point, affirming his enduring commitment after years of underrecognition compared to contemporaries like KiDi and Kuami Eugene.[2]
