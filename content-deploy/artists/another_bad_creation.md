## Biography
Another Bad Creation (ABC) was an American hip-hop and R&B group formed in Atlanta, Georgia in 1988, discovered and managed by Michael Bivins of New Edition and Bell Biv DeVoe fame.[1][3] The group consisted of preteens Romell "RoRo" Chapman, Chris Sellers, David Shelton, and brothers Demetrius "Red" and Marliss "Mark" Pugh, with Adrian "G.A." Witcher serving as an unofficial member.[1] ABC rose to prominence in the early 1990s as part of the new jack swing movement, becoming media darlings by the end of 1991 with appearances on magazine covers, television shows, and in films.[1] Their 1991 debut album *Coolin' at the Playground Ya Know!* achieved significant commercial success, establishing them as a major schoolyard hip-hop phenomenon with a Top 10 single and hit album.[1][5]

Despite their meteoric rise, ABC's career proved to be short-lived. By 1993, when their sophomore album *It Ain't What U Wear, It's How U Play It* was released, the group had experienced significant overexposure that diminished their cultural impact.[1] The album's singles, including "I Don't Wanna Be Grown Up" and "Where's Ya Little Sista," failed to chart, and the group soon disbanded.[1] The members went on to pursue individual careers, with some transitioning into acting and community involvement in Atlanta.[1] ABC experienced a quiet reunion in 2006 with *The Grady Baby Compilation* EP, which featured tracks from past members but received minimal attention.[1]

## Fun Facts
- Another Bad Creation had a notable hip-hop beef with Kris Kross in the early 1990s; Mac Daddy referenced them in the original version of 'Jump' by saying 'don't try to compare us to another bad little fad,' though the conflict ultimately led nowhere.[1]
- The group dominated pop culture from 1991-1992 but experienced rapid decline by 1993 due to overexposure, demonstrating that the phenomenon of infantile music feuds and short-lived child star careers is not a 21st century invention.[1]
- ABC's album titles were notably unconventional and cryptic; their debut was titled *Coolin' at the Playground Ya Know!* and their sophomore album was *It Ain't What U Wear, It's How U Play It*, the latter of which confused even contemporary observers.[1]
- Several group members remained in Atlanta as adults and pursued diverse careers; some became involved in community work and acting, with Chris Sellers appearing in the sitcom 'Living With LucyLu' in the 2000s.[1]
