## Biography
Gaia Piá is a Brazilian-born reggae artist known for blending traditional roots reggae with more melancholic, introspective moods and spiritual themes.[2] Public biographical details such as her birth year, full legal name, and early life are not reliably documented in major reference sources, and available profiles instead emphasize the conceptual and emotional foundations of her project rather than a conventional life story.[2][4] The name “Gaia Piá” itself is described as a creation of the project’s vocalist Bruno and is tied to an idea of returning to a childlike purity of spirit and seeking refuge in an inner world of innocence and authenticity.[4]

Musically, Gaia Piá has been presented as a project rather than a personality-driven solo star, rooted in Brazilian reggae but open to wider influences from spiritual and meditative music.[2][4] Descriptions in Portuguese fan and community sources highlight an emphasis on positivity, reflection, and emotional depth, proposing Gaia Piá as a vehicle for reconnecting with one’s inner child and with nature.[4] Because detailed press coverage and mainstream media interviews are scarce, much of the project’s public identity to date comes through its recorded tracks and short online biographies, which frame Gaia Piá as a contemplative, values‑driven presence in contemporary Brazilian reggae rather than a celebrity figure with an extensively chronicled personal history.[2][4]
