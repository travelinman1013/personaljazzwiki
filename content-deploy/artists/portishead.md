## Biography
Portishead is an English band formed in 1991 in Bristol, England, known for pioneering the trip-hop genre with their atmospheric blend of hip-hop, jazz, and electronic music. The group was founded by Geoff Barrow, Beth Gibbons, and Adrian Utley, who met through Bristol’s vibrant music scene and a local job-training program. Their debut album, Dummy (1994), fused haunting vocals, cinematic soundscapes, and innovative production techniques, earning widespread acclaim and the Mercury Music Prize. The band’s music is characterized by melancholic moods, slow beats, and a sense of isolation, inspired by the coastal town of Portishead, Somerset, after which they named themselves. Over the years, Portishead released two more studio albums—Portishead (1997) and Third (2008)—each showcasing their evolution while maintaining their signature atmospheric style. Their influence on alternative and electronic music remains profound, with tracks like 'Sour Times' and 'Glory Box' becoming genre-defining anthems.
