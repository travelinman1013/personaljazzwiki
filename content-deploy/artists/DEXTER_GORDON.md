## Biography
Dexter Gordon was born on February 27, 1923, in Los Angeles, California, into a prominent family—his father was one of the first African American doctors in Los Angeles, and his mother was the daughter of an African American soldier awarded the Medal of Honor for service in the Spanish-American War. Gordon began his musical journey at age 13 with the clarinet, switching to alto saxophone at 15 before settling on the tenor saxophone at age 17. He studied under multi-instrumentalist Lloyd Reese at Jefferson High School, where he played alongside future jazz luminaries Chico Hamilton and Buddy Collette. While still in school, Gordon accepted an invitation from alto saxophonist Marshall Royal to join Lionel Hampton's Band, where he performed from 1940 to 1943, making his first recordings in 1942 and learning from fellow band members Illinois Jacquet and Joe Newman.

Gordon emerged as one of the leading bebop tenor saxophonists, distinguished by his near-vibratoless sound and extraordinary improvisational abilities. After moving to New York in 1944 to join the Billy Eckstine Orchestra, he played and recorded with bebop pioneers including Charlie Parker, Max Roach, Fats Navarro, and Miles Davis on the legendary 52nd Street. His 1947 recording "The Chase" with tenor saxophonist Wardell Gray became a bestseller for Dial Records, cementing his reputation through their celebrated tenor "duels." From 1945, he recorded extensively for Savoy Records, producing classics like "Blow Mr. Dexter," "Dexter's Deck," and "Long Tall Dexter." The 1960s marked a golden period when he collaborated with Blue Note Records, working with Freddie Hubbard, Bud Powell, Bobby Hutcherson, and others while exploring modal playing and hard bop. Gordon lived in Copenhagen from the 1960s until his return to the United States in 1976, when Columbia Records celebrated his "homecoming" with a live album that introduced him to a new generation of jazz fans.

Standing 6'6" tall and nicknamed "Long Tall Dexter," Gordon maintained his commitment to bebop throughout his four-decade career, never moving beyond the genre like contemporaries John Coltrane and Sonny Rollins. His saxophone sound was large, warm, and spacious, continuing the tradition established by Lester Young while incorporating the innovative influence of Charlie Parker. Gordon recorded nearly 100 albums as a leader, most notably for Blue Note, with iconic album covers that became part of jazz history. Along with Art Blakey and Betty Carter, he played a key role in the resurgence of straight-ahead jazz during the late 1970s and early 1980s, performing at clubs and festivals backed by stellar musicians like George Cables, Ronnie Mathews, Rufus Reid, Louis Hayes, and Eddie Gladden until his death.

## Fun Facts
- Gordon was nicknamed 'Long Tall Dexter' because of his impressive height of 6 feet 6 inches, making him one of the tallest figures in jazz history.
- His 1947 recording 'The Chase' with Wardell Gray became a bestseller and popularized the concept of tenor saxophone 'duels' that captured widespread listener attention.
- Gordon lived in Copenhagen, Denmark throughout most of the 1960s and early 1970s, part of a wave of jazz musicians who moved to Europe during the rock and soul era when straight-ahead jazz fell out of favor in the United States.
- His 1976 return to the United States was celebrated by Columbia Records with a live album called 'Homecoming' recorded at Village Vanguard in New York, which successfully reintroduced him to a new generation of younger jazz fans and helped spark the resurgence of straight-ahead jazz in the late 1970s and early 1980s.
