## Biography
Deborah Coleman (October 3, 1956 – April 12, 2018) was a celebrated American blues guitarist, singer, and songwriter, renowned for her powerful guitar work and soulful vocals. Born in Portsmouth, Virginia, she grew up in a musically rich military family, moving frequently between cities such as San Diego, San Francisco, Bremerton, and Chicago. Surrounded by music—her father played piano, her brothers played guitar, and her sister played guitar and keyboards—Coleman picked up the guitar at the age of eight and began performing in rock and R&B bands as a teenager, initially as a bassist before switching to lead guitar after being inspired by Jimi Hendrix.[1][3][4][7]

Coleman’s professional recording career began in the mid-1990s, with her debut album 'Takin' A Stand' released in 1994, followed by her acclaimed Blind Pig debut 'I Can't Lose' in 1997. Her music blended blues, rock, and soul, characterized by gritty songwriting, expressive guitar solos, and energetic live performances. She drew inspiration from blues legends like Muddy Waters and Howlin’ Wolf, as well as rock icons such as Led Zeppelin and Cream, while her guitar style reflected the influence of Jimi Hendrix, Buddy Guy, Freddie King, Albert Collins, and Larry Carlton. Over her career, Coleman released several albums, including 'Soul Be It' (2002), 'What About Love?' (2004), and 'Stop the Game' (2007), and appeared on the collaborative album 'Time Bomb' (2007) with Sue Foley and Roxanne Potvin.[1][3][6][7]

Coleman was widely recognized for her contributions to modern blues, winning the Orville Gibson Award for Best Blues Guitarist, Female in 2001 and receiving nine W.C. Handy Blues Music Award nominations. She performed at major festivals such as the Monterey Jazz Festival, San Francisco Blues Festival, and North Atlantic Blues Festival, leaving a lasting legacy as one of the most dynamic and respected artists in contemporary blues. Her unexpected death in 2018 from complications of bronchitis and pneumonia marked the loss of a trailblazing musician whose influence continues to resonate within the blues community.[1][3][4][7]
