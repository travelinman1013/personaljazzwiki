## Biography
Stan Getz, born Stanley Gayetski on February 2, 1927, in Philadelphia and raised in the Bronx, was an American jazz saxophonist renowned for his warm, lyrical tone, earning him the nickname "The Sound." Drawn to music from a young age, Getz began on harmonica and various instruments before settling on the tenor saxophone. By age 16, he was already performing with Jack Teagarden's band, and soon after played with major swing orchestras led by Stan Kenton, Jimmy Dorsey, and Benny Goodman. His breakthrough came as a member of Woody Herman's Second Herd (1947–1949), where his solo on "Early Autumn" and his role in the celebrated "Four Brothers" saxophone section brought him national attention.

Throughout the 1950s, Getz established himself as a leading figure in cool jazz and bebop, collaborating with top musicians and recording prolifically. In the early 1960s, he became a pivotal force in popularizing bossa nova in the United States, notably through his collaborations with Brazilian artists João Gilberto and Antônio Carlos Jobim. The album "Getz/Gilberto" (1964), featuring the hit "The Girl from Ipanema," won multiple Grammy Awards and introduced Brazilian jazz to a global audience. Despite personal struggles with addiction and turbulent relationships, Getz continued to evolve musically, experimenting with new forms and electronics, and remained active as a performer and educator until his death on June 6, 1991.

Getz's legacy endures as one of jazz's most influential tenor saxophonists, admired for his melodic inventiveness and ability to bridge genres. His lyrical style and openness to new influences inspired generations of musicians and left an indelible mark on jazz and popular music.
