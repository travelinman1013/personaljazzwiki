## Biography
This Is The Kit is the musical project led by British singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Kate Stables, originating from Winchester, England. Stables began the project in 2003, initially as a solo endeavor, before it evolved into a collaborative band with a revolving lineup of musicians. After formative years in Bristol, where she immersed herself in the local music scene, Stables relocated to Paris, though the band's creative heart remains closely tied to Bristol's vibrant community.[1][3][4]

The band's debut album, 'Krülle Bol' (2008), produced by John Parish, established their reputation for thoughtful, folk-inflected songwriting and intricate arrangements. Subsequent releases, including 'Wriggle Out the Restless' (2010), 'Bashed Out' (2015), 'Moonshine Freeze' (2017), 'Off Off On' (2020), and 'Careful of Your Keepers' (2023), have garnered critical acclaim and expanded their audience. Collaborations with producers like Aaron Dessner (The National) and Gruff Rhys (Super Furry Animals) have further enriched their sound, blending folk, indie, and subtle experimental elements.[1][2][3][5]

This Is The Kit's music is characterized by Stables' gentle vocals, poetic lyricism, and a distinctive blend of acoustic and electric textures. The band has become a fixture in British folk and indie circles, earning praise from BBC Radio 6 DJs and sharing stages with artists such as The National, Iron & Wine, and Sharon Van Etten. Their legacy is marked by a commitment to musical community, collaboration, and a quietly innovative approach to songwriting.[1][3][4]
