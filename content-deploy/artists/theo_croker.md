## Biography
Theo Croker was born on July 18, 1985, in Leesburg, Florida, and discovered his passion for jazz at age eleven after hearing his grandfather, legendary trumpeter Doc Cheatham, perform at Sweet Basil in New York City. Though Doc passed away the following year at age 92, Theo immersed himself in his grandfather's recordings, teaching himself trumpet by playing along with the greats and gradually developing his own harmonic voice. His first public performance came at age twelve during a memorial service for his grandfather, an experience that crystallized his lifelong commitment to music. After high school, Croker chose to study at Oberlin Conservatory in Ohio under the mentorship of jazz legend Donald Byrd, alongside other active jazz icons including Gary Bartz, Billy Hart, and Marcus Belgrave—a decision driven by his desire to learn from living, working musicians rather than traditional teachers.[4][7]

Following his 2007 graduation from Oberlin, Croker embarked on a transformative seven-year sojourn in Shanghai, China, where he broadened his musical palette beyond traditional jazz to encompass hip-hop, R&B, fusion, salsa, and electronic sounds. During this period, he held a five-month residency at Shanghai's House of Blues and Jazz and served as bandleader and in-house composer for the television show Asia Uncut Star Network. In Shanghai, he met vocalist Dee Dee Bridgewater, who became instrumental in launching his recording career by signing him to her DDB Records label.[4][5] His 2014 debut album "Afro Physicist," produced by Bridgewater and released through Sony Music Masterworks, marked his return to the United States and established him as a distinctive voice in contemporary jazz.

Croker has since become a GRAMMY-nominated artist known for refusing musical boundaries and blending jazz with contemporary genres. His 2019 album "Star People Nation" earned a nomination for Best Contemporary Instrumental Album at the 62nd GRAMMY Awards and received critical acclaim from The New York Times for its innovative fusion of hip-hop beats, swing, and African percussion. His subsequent albums "LOVE QUANTUM," "BLK2LIFE || A FUTURE PAST" (2020), and "BY THE WAY" showcase his evolution as a composer and producer while maintaining his distinctive trumpet voice. Beyond his solo work, Croker has contributed to platinum-selling albums by artists including J. Cole and Ari Lennox, establishing himself as both a bandleader and collaborative force in contemporary music.[1][3]

## Fun Facts
- Croker spent seven years living in Shanghai, China (2006-2013), where he held a five-month residency at the House of Blues and Jazz and served as bandleader for a late-night television show modeled after The Tonight Show, significantly broadening his musical palette beyond traditional jazz.[4][5]
- At age eleven, after hearing his grandfather Doc Cheatham perform at Sweet Basil jazz club in New York City, Croker taught himself trumpet by sitting in his room for hours playing along with his grandfather's recordings and other jazz greats, gradually learning to fit in harmonically with what he was hearing.[4][6]
- During his time in Shanghai, Croker strategically avoided working with singers on instrumental music, allowing his compositions to escape content flagging that might have occurred with vocal tracks—a practical approach that helped him develop his distinctive instrumental voice.[2]
- Croker received the prestigious Presser Music Foundation Award in spring 2006, which he used to fund the recording of his debut album "The Fundamentals" with The Theo Croker Sextet in New York City, launching his professional recording career.[4]
