## Biography
Bobby Hutcherson (January 27, 1941 – August 15, 2016) was a pioneering American jazz vibraphonist and composer, widely regarded as one of the most influential figures in modern jazz. Born in Los Angeles and raised in Pasadena, California, Hutcherson was introduced to music through early piano studies with his aunt, but his passion for jazz was ignited after hearing Milt Jackson play 'Bemsha Swing.' Inspired, he saved for his own vibraphone and began performing locally in his teens, notably with bassist Herbie Lewis and saxophonists Curtis Amy and Charles Lloyd.

Hutcherson's career took off in the early 1960s when he joined the Al Grey–Billy Mitchell group and moved to New York, where his innovative four-mallet technique and harmonic sophistication quickly made him an in-demand sideman. He became a cornerstone of the Blue Note label, contributing to over 250 albums as a sideman and leading more than 40 sessions. His collaborations with avant-garde artists like Eric Dolphy ('Out to Lunch'), Jackie McLean, and Andrew Hill, as well as hard bop luminaries such as Dexter Gordon and Joe Henderson, showcased his versatility and helped redefine the vibraphone's role in jazz. Hutcherson's own compositions, including 'Little B’s Poem' and 'Montara,' became jazz standards, and his sound bridged hard bop, post-bop, free jazz, and jazz funk.

Returning to California in the late 1960s, Hutcherson formed influential groups with saxophonist Harold Land and later trumpeter Woody Shaw, continuing to record and tour internationally. His legacy endures through his technical mastery, adventurous spirit, and the generations of musicians he inspired. Hutcherson was honored as an NEA Jazz Master in 2010 and is remembered as 'by far the most harmonically advanced person to ever play the vibraphone.'
