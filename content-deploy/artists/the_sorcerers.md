## Biography
The Sorcerers are a Leeds-based instrumental group formed in 2015, known for their innovative fusion of Ethiopian jazz, jazz funk, and cinematic soundscapes. The band was conceived when guitarist Pete Williams and bassist Neil Innes, inspired by the sounds of Ethio-jazz legends like Mulatu Astatke and Tilahun Gessesse, wrote an Ethio-inspired piece for a 7" single. The overwhelmingly positive response led them to expand the project into a full-fledged band, eventually joined by drummer Joost Hendrickx, pianist Johnny Richards, and multi-instrumentalist Richard Ormrod. Their debut album, released on ATA Records, established them as a standout act in the vibrant Leeds music scene, blending the hypnotic grooves of 1960s and 70s Ethiopian music with elements of European horror film soundtracks, library music, and funk.[1][2][4][6][7]

Throughout their career, The Sorcerers have remained committed to honoring the roots of Ethio-jazz while pushing its boundaries. Their creative process often involves improvisation and experimentation, with influences ranging from American composer Moondog to Brazilian multi-instrumentalist Hermeto Pascoal, and Nigerian synth-funk pioneer William Onyeabor. The band records and produces their music in-house at ATA Studios, with a core group of musicians frequently collaborating across various projects on the label. Their third album, 'I Too Am A Stranger,' released after a four-year hiatus, further cements their reputation for crafting atmospheric, groove-driven music that pays homage to its inspirations while remaining distinctly their own.[1][3][4][7]

The Sorcerers' legacy lies in their ability to reimagine Ethio-jazz through a Yorkshire lens, creating a sound that is both respectful of its origins and refreshingly original. Their work has been championed by figures like Jazzman Gerald and has contributed to a renewed interest in global jazz fusion within the UK and beyond.[2][7]
