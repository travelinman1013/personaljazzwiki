## Biography
Sade, born Helen Folasade Adu on January 16, 1959, in Ibadan, Nigeria, is a Nigerian-born British singer renowned for her sophisticated blend of soul, jazz, funk, and Afro-Cuban rhythms. She moved to Essex, England, at age four after her parents separated, and later studied fashion design at Central St. Martin’s College of Art and Design in London. Initially working as a model and menswear designer, Sade's musical journey began when she joined the funk band Arriva as a temporary lead singer, later moving on to the band Pride, where her songwriting and vocal talents began to attract industry attention.[2][1][7]

In 1983, Sade, along with Stuart Matthewman, Andrew Hale, and Paul Spencer Denman, formed the band Sade, named after her own nickname. Their debut album, 'Diamond Life' (1984), featuring hits like 'Your Love Is King' and 'Smooth Operator,' catapulted them to international fame and earned them a Grammy Award for Best New Artist. Sade's music is characterized by understated elegance, smooth vocals, and a fusion of genres that defied easy categorization. Subsequent albums such as 'Promise' (1985), 'Stronger Than Pride' (1988), 'Love Deluxe' (1992), and 'Lovers Rock' (2000) solidified her status as an iconic figure in contemporary music, with a reputation for both critical and commercial success.[2][1]

After periods of hiatus, Sade continued to release acclaimed work, including the Grammy-winning 'Soldier of Love' (2010) and the single 'Flower of the Universe' for the film 'A Wrinkle in Time' (2018). Her influence on modern soul and pop is profound, and she has been recognized with numerous honors, including appointment as Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 2018. Sade's legacy endures through her timeless sound, innovative approach to genre, and the lasting impact she has had on generations of artists.[2][1]
