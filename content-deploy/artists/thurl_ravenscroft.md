## Biography
Thurl Arthur Ravenscroft was born on February 6, 1914, in Norfolk, Nebraska, and raised there before moving to California in 1933 to study at the Otis Art Institute, initially pursuing interior design. His early career in entertainment began with singing groups like the Goose Creek Quartet and The Sportsmen in 1939, where he performed as a bass singer on radio shows and records, including backups for Marie Greene. World War II interrupted his trajectory as he served five years as a navigator for the U.S. Air Transport Command, flying high-profile passengers like Winston Churchill and Bob Hope across the Atlantic.[1][2][3]

Returning to Hollywood after the war, Ravenscroft formed The Mellomen quartet, contributing vocals to Disney films such as *Alice in Wonderland* and *Lady and the Tramp*, and numerous Disneyland attractions including The Haunted Mansion and Pirates of the Caribbean. His booming bass voice became iconic as Tony the Tiger for Kellogg's Frosted Flakes commercials from the 1950s until his retirement, spanning over five decades, and as the uncredited singer of 'You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch' in the 1966 TV special. He also narrated events like the Pageant of the Masters and recorded religious hymns, showcasing a versatile style blending deep bass singing with voice acting across animation, advertising, and choral work.[1][2][4]

Ravenscroft's legacy endures through his Disney Legend status in 1995 after six decades of contributions, his unmistakable voice in holiday classics and commercials, and a career marked by uncredited gems that gained recognition posthumously. A devoted Christian, he passed away on May 22, 2005, at age 91 from prostate cancer, leaving behind a fullerton, California residence with his wife June.[1][2][5]
