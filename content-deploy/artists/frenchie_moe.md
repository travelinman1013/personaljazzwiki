## Biography
Frenchie Moe, born in France in 1986, discovered her passion for blues guitar and vocals at age 8 after seeing British bluesman Victor Brox perform, leading to her mentorship under him and her first stage appearances at 12 and formation of her own band by 15. At 19, she moved to the USA, spending five years in the Midwest working odd jobs, forming musical projects, and receiving guidance from bluesman Creighton Holley of the Chicago Rhythm Kings before relocating to New Orleans in 2011, her dream city. There, she immersed herself in the local scene, forming the Frenchie Moe Trio and collaborating with Louisiana Music Hall of Famers Coco Robicheaux and Walter 'Wolfman' Washington, with whom she shares a daughter.

Her musical style blends soulful blues standards, old-school R&B, funky grooves, and originals, influenced by Southern Creole sounds, Chicago grit, and New Orleans R&B fire, delivered through her theatrical cabaret-like vocals, clean melodic guitar tones, and fluid solos reminiscent of B.B. King and Leo Nocentelli. Debut album 'Way Down in Hustleville' (independent release) showcased her unique spin on covers like 'Something You Got' in French, while 'Soul Full Tonight' (2023) featured her on vocals and guitar with bandmates Bruce Elsensohn (keys), Andres Villafarra/Adam Crochet (bass), and Keith Hawkins/Ian Petillo (drums), plus guest Sunpie Barnes. Her latest 'Hi Class' on Lightning in a Bottle Records highlights live-recorded electric blues with collaborators like Ward Smith and Tiffany Pollack.

As a female artist in a male-dominated genre, Frenchie Moe advocates for recognition beyond aesthetics, emphasizing compassion from blues' resilient origins. Based in New Orleans since 2011, she continues performing high-energy shows, preserving blues lineage while carving her individual path.
