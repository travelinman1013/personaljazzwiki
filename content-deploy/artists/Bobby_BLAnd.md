## Biography
Robert Calvin Brooks, known professionally as Bobby "Blue" Bland, was a highly influential American blues singer born January 27, 1930, in Barretville, Tennessee.  His early life was marked by poverty; he left school in the third grade to work in the cotton fields and later adopted the surname "Bland" from his stepfather.  Moving to Memphis in 1947, he began singing with local gospel groups, notably the Miniatures, and found inspiration in the sermons of Detroit preacher C.L. Franklin.  His exposure to the vibrant Beale Street music scene, where he associated with fellow musicians including B.B. King, Rosco Gordon, Junior Parker, and Johnny Ace (collectively known as the Beale Streeters), significantly shaped his musical development.  Nat King Cole also influenced his sound.

Bland's professional career began with recordings for Modern and Sun Records in the early 1950s, though these were initially unsuccessful.  His association with Ike Turner, who recorded him for Modern Records, proved pivotal.  After serving in the U.S. Army, he signed with Duke Records under Don Robey, a contract that, despite its unfavorable terms, launched his career.  He toured extensively on the Chitlin' Circuit with Junior Parker in Blues Consolidated, developing his signature big-band blues sound with collaborators like bandleader Bill Harvey and arranger Joe Scott, often accompanied by guitarist Wayne Bennett.  His breakthrough came in 1957 with "Farther Up the Road," reaching number 1 on the R&B chart.  Subsequent hits included "Little Boy Blue," "Cry Cry Cry," "I Pity the Fool," and "Turn On Your Love Light," many of which were written by Joe Scott, despite often being credited to Robey.  Bland also achieved success with his version of T-Bone Walker's "Call It Stormy Monday (But Tuesday Is Just as Bad)," which became a hit single.  His career spanned decades, with notable later success on ABC Records and Malaco Records, including the albums *His California Album*, *Dreamer*, and *Sweet Vibrations*.  He achieved 23 top ten hits on the Billboard R&B chart and was ranked number 13 of the all-time top-charting artists in Joel Whitburn's *Top R&B/Hip-Hop Singles: 1942–1995*.

Bland's musical style blended gospel and blues with R&B influences, creating a dramatic and emotionally resonant sound that earned him accolades such as "the Lion of the Blues" and "the Sinatra of the Blues."  His powerful vocals and sophisticated arrangements, often featuring big-band instrumentation, set him apart.  His influence is evident in the numerous artists who covered his songs, including Van Morrison and Whitesnake.  His legacy extends beyond his impressive discography; he was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and the Memphis Music Hall of Fame, and received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.  His enduring popularity is further evidenced by Rolling Stone's 2023 ranking of him as one of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.  Bland's career demonstrates a remarkable blend of musical innovation, commercial success, and lasting cultural impact.
