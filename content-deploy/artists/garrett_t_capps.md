## Biography
Garrett T. Capps is an American singer-songwriter and alt-country musician hailing from San Antonio, Texas. Growing up in the city's North Side suburbs as an only child, Capps was immersed in music from an early age, starting on drums in fifth grade and later teaching himself guitar to pursue songwriting. His musical journey began with punk and metal bands in high school, including the group Boy Scout Cookies, before gravitating toward alt-country and Americana. After a stint in Austin, where he honed his craft alongside peers like John Baumann, Capps returned to San Antonio, where he became a central figure in the city's music scene. He is known for his eclectic style, blending honky-tonk, Tex-Mex, and cosmic country with a touch of humor and irreverence. Capps has released several albums, including 'I Like Austin, But I Love San Antone,' which celebrates his hometown and its musical heritage. Beyond performing, he is a co-owner of The Lonesome Rose, a country-themed club, and a tireless promoter of local and national artists, helping to elevate San Antonio's status in the alt-country world.

Capps's music is marked by its wit, emotional depth, and genre-blending experimentation. He leads multiple bands, including NASA Country and The Three Timers, each exploring different facets of country, rock, and Tex-Mex. His work often pays homage to Texas songwriting legends while pushing the boundaries of traditional country music. Capps is also recognized for his podcast 'Trouble Country,' which features interviews with nationally-known musicians, and for his efforts in supporting local artists through benefit events and collaborations. His legacy is that of a passionate advocate for San Antonio's music culture and a distinctive voice in the alt-country genre.
