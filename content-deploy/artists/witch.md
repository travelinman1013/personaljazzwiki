## Biography
WITCH (We Intend To Cause Havoc) is a Zamrock band formed in the early 1970s in Kitwe, Zambia, during the country's post-independence golden era. Led by vocalist Emanuel "Jagari" Chanda, the band emerged as a prime mover in the Zamrock movement, an indigenous rock genre that fused the hard-edged sound of Western rock bands like the Rolling Stones, James Brown, Grand Funk Railroad, and Black Sabbath with African musical traditions. The band's electrifying sonic aesthetic, world-is-ours mentality, and bold moniker captivated audiences across Zambia, earning them the affectionate title of "Zambia's Beatles" and establishing them as legends throughout the country. Their incendiary on-stage antics and legendary seven-hour sets generated gargantuan local fame during the 1970s.

WITCH recorded five ferocious albums across the 1970s—more than any other Zamrock band in history—showcasing their progressive, balls-to-the-wall Afro-rock sound. However, the band underwent a dramatic evolutionary trajectory, most notably with their 1980 album Moving On, which marked their bold shift toward disco-glam and boogie-driven floor-fillers. This reinvention proved commercially successful; their track "My Desire" reached No. 1 on the South African charts for six weeks, competing directly with international artists like Michael Jackson. Despite these achievements, by the late 1970s and 1980s, economic collapse, increasing government authoritarianism, and socio-political unrest forced the band to adapt. Jagari eventually left the band in the early 1980s over creative differences regarding the disco direction, pursuing a career as a teacher, while WITCH continued with new vocalists Patrick Chisembele and Christine Jackson before shifting toward Kalindula music under the leadership of Chris Mbewe.

After the mid-1980s, WITCH faded into obscurity and ceased live performances until 2012, when Chanda was invited to the United States to revive the band. This renaissance was catalyzed by a record company that reissued WITCH's albums and made them available for streaming, reawakening global interest in their groundbreaking work. As of 2013, WITCH resumed touring with a new international lineup including Jagari alongside musicians from the Netherlands, Germany, and Switzerland. The band's legacy has been firmly cemented as pioneers of Zamrock and architects of one of Africa's most distinctive and influential rock movements.

## Fun Facts
- WITCH's stage name 'Jagari' Chanda is an Africanization of Mick Jagger from the Rolling Stones, reflecting Chanda's deep admiration for the band during his formative years.
- The band performed as curtain raisers for Bob Marley at a historic event celebrating Zimbabwean Independence, where they played their track 'Freedom Fighter' in an all-white stadium that, for the very first time, allowed all races to attend—the entire stadium erupted when they performed.
- WITCH's disco-era track 'My Desire' from their 1980 album Moving On reached No. 1 on the South African charts for six weeks, competing directly with international superstars like Michael Jackson, demonstrating the band's commercial prowess beyond their home country.
- After fading into obscurity in the mid-1980s, WITCH remained inactive for nearly 30 years until a record company reissued their albums and made them available for streaming, sparking a global rediscovery of the band and leading to their 2012 revival and international touring.
