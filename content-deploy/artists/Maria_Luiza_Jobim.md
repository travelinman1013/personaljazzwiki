## Biography
Maria Luiza Lontra Jobim, born March 20, 1987, is a Brazilian singer, composer, and music producer, best known for her work in bossa nova, MPB, synth-pop, and lo-fi genres[2]. The daughter of the legendary composer Antônio Carlos 'Tom' Jobim and Ana Beatriz Lontra Jobim, Maria Luiza grew up immersed in a profoundly artistic environment, surrounded by icons of Brazilian music such as Chico Buarque and Dorival Caymmi[3]. Her musical journey began at age seven, when she recorded 'Samba de Maria Luiza' and 'Forever Green' with her father on his 1994 album 'Antônio Brasileiro'—a project that later won a Grammy for Best Latin Jazz Performance[1][2]. Despite her early exposure to music, Maria Luiza initially pursued studies in architecture and literature before fully committing to a musical career[1][2].

Maria Luiza's professional trajectory includes stints as the vocalist for the band Baleia and as part of the electronic duo Opala with Lucas de Paiva[2]. In 2006, she recorded the theme song for the Brazilian telenovela 'Páginas da Vida' alongside her nephew Daniel Jobim, offering a Portuguese version of her father's classic 'Wave'[2]. Her solo career took off with the release of her debut album 'Casa Branca' in 2019, followed by 'Azul' in 2023, which features collaborations with prominent artists such as Arnaldo Antunes, Adriana Calcanhotto, and Lisa Ono[1]. Maria Luiza's music is marked by a blend of traditional Brazilian styles with contemporary influences, reflecting both her heritage and her personal evolution, especially after motherhood, which she cites as a period of healing and artistic rediscovery[1].
