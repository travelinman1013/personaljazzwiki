## Biography
Johnny Shines was born on April 25, 1915, in Frayser, Tennessee, now a part of Memphis. He learned guitar from his mother and spent his early years playing slide guitar in Memphis’s juke joints and on the streets. In 1932, he moved to Hughes, Arkansas, working on farms before a chance encounter with Robert Johnson in 1935 reignited his passion for music. Shines traveled extensively with Johnson across the United States and Canada, absorbing Johnson’s style and repertoire until their partnership ended in 1937, a year before Johnson’s death.

After touring the South, Shines settled in Chicago in 1941, where he became a fixture in the burgeoning blues scene. He worked construction jobs to support his family but continued to perform in local bars, recording his first tracks in the mid-1940s and early 1950s, though many were not released at the time. His 1952 recordings for J.O.B. Records are considered among his finest, but commercial success eluded him, prompting a temporary retreat from music. Rediscovered in the 1960s, Shines contributed to the classic 'Chicago/The Blues/Today!' album and toured with the Chicago All Stars, collaborating with blues luminaries such as Willie Dixon and Big Walter Horton. He moved to Alabama in 1969, where he became a mentor to younger musicians and continued performing internationally until a stroke in 1980 limited his guitar playing, though he remained a powerful vocalist and performer.

Shines’s music is characterized by intense vibrato, imaginative lyrics rooted in tradition, and masterful slide guitar technique. He was one of the last practitioners of acoustic Delta blues, bridging the gap between the rural blues of the South and the electrified Chicago sound. His legacy is closely tied to his role as a carrier of Robert Johnson’s musical tradition, but his own compositions and performances have left a lasting mark on the blues genre. Johnny Shines died in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, on April 20, 1992, and was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame that same year.
