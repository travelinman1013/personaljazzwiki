## Biography
Buddy Bolden, born Charles Joseph Bolden Jr. on September 6, 1877, in New Orleans, Louisiana, grew up in a musically vibrant environment among free persons of color. He began playing the cornet around 1894, taking lessons and quickly advancing, first performing with local bands led by figures like Manuel Hall and Charlie Galloway, a barber whose shop served as a musician hub. By the late 1890s, Bolden's band became renowned in New Orleans, particularly in Black Storyville at venues like Union Sons Hall, where they innovated by blending brass band marches, blues, and ragtime—pioneering elements of Dixieland jazz.[1][3]

Bolden's career peaked in the early 1900s as he was dubbed 'King Bolden' by adoring crowds chanting his name, performing at dances, parades, and parties across the city. His style featured powerful, improvisational cornet playing that embellished melodies with a hot, rhythmic edge, setting it apart from standard waltzes and quadrilles. However, mounting pressure from fame led to mental health decline starting in 1906; he missed gigs, fought with bandmates, short-changed them, and walked off a Labor Day parade, resulting in institutionalization at the Jackson Asylum where he lived until his death on November 4, 1931.[1][3]

Bolden's legacy as a foundational jazz figure endures despite scant recordings—his influence shaped early jazz through oral tradition and the musicians he inspired in New Orleans' scene, though definitive proof of his primacy remains debated amid mythology.[1][3]
