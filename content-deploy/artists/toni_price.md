## Biography
Toni Price (born Luiese Esther Price on March 13, 1961, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) was a celebrated American country blues singer whose career became synonymous with the vibrant Austin, Texas music scene. Adopted and raised by the Prices, she was named after her grandmothers and first encountered blues through the music of Bonnie Raitt, later delving into the works of classic blueswomen like Sippie Wallace and Victoria Spivey. After early years in New Jersey and Nashville—where she made her stage debut at age 10—Price found the Nashville music industry too restrictive and relocated to Austin in 1989 after a pivotal performance at the South by Southwest festival.[1][2][6]

In Austin, Price flourished, becoming a fixture at Antone’s nightclub and forging deep ties with the local blues community. Her debut album, 'Swim Away' (1993), and its follow-up 'Hey' (1995) received critical acclaim, with her soulful, honeyed alto drawing comparisons to Patsy Cline and Bonnie Raitt. Price was known for her eclectic blend of country, blues, and Americana, and for her long-running 'Hippie Hour' Tuesday night residency at the Continental Club, which became a beloved Austin tradition. Over her career, she released numerous albums and earned multiple Austin Music Awards, including Female Vocalist of the Year and Album of the Year.[1][2][3]

Price was celebrated for her authenticity and commitment to performing on her own terms, rarely touring outside Austin and cultivating a devoted local following. Her collaborations with local musicians, especially the late fiddler Champ Hood, and her mentorship of younger artists cemented her legacy as a cornerstone of Austin’s roots music scene. Toni Price died on November 22, 2024, at age 63, following complications from a brain aneurysm, leaving behind a rich legacy of soulful performances and community spirit.[1][2][6]
