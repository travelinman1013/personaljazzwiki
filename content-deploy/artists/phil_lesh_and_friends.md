## Biography
Phil Lesh & Friends was an American rock band formed and led by Phil Lesh, the former bassist of the Grateful Dead. The group was not a fixed ensemble but rather a rotating collective of musicians, allowing for a wide range of musical styles and collaborations. The first Phil Lesh & Friends concert took place in 1994 at the Berkeley Community Theatre, featuring Lesh alongside Jerry Garcia, Bob Weir, and Vince Welnick, but the band was revived in 1998 with a new rotating lineup. Over the years, Phil Lesh & Friends became known for its improvisational jam band style, blending Grateful Dead classics with new material and covers, often featuring guest musicians from prominent jam and rock bands. The group released its only studio album, 'There and Back Again,' in 2002, which included songs written by Lesh and longtime Grateful Dead lyricist Robert Hunter, as well as contributions from other collaborators. Phil Lesh & Friends played a vital role in keeping the Grateful Dead’s musical legacy alive, especially after Garcia’s death in 1995, and continued to perform until Lesh’s passing in 2024.
