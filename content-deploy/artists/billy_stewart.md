## Biography
Billy Stewart, born William Larry Stewart II on March 24, 1937, in Washington, D.C., emerged as a distinctive voice in American rhythm and blues during the 1960s. Raised in a musically gifted family, Stewart began performing at age 12 with his brothers as The Four Stewart Brothers, singing gospel and hosting a weekly radio show on WUST-AM in Washington, D.C. This early exposure, combined with piano lessons from his mother, laid the foundation for his musical career. Stewart transitioned to secular music by filling in for The Rainbows, a local vocal group, where he connected with future stars like Don Covay and Marvin Gaye.

Stewart's big break came when rock and roll legend Bo Diddley discovered him playing piano in Washington, D.C., in 1956. Diddley invited Stewart to join his band and helped secure a recording contract with Chess Records, where Stewart's debut single, 'Billy's Blues,' featured Diddley on guitar. Stewart's unique vocal style—marked by rapid word doubling, scatting, and improvisational trills—set him apart from his contemporaries. He achieved commercial success with hits such as 'I Do Love You,' 'Sitting in the Park,' and his radical, virtuosic rendition of George Gershwin's 'Summertime.' Despite his growing acclaim, Stewart's career was cut short when he died in a car accident in North Carolina on January 17, 1970, at the age of 32.

Stewart's legacy endures through his innovative vocal techniques and his influence on the soul genre. He was posthumously inducted into the Washington Area Music Association Hall of Fame in 2002 and the National Rhythm & Blues Hall of Fame in 2021, recognized as a creative genius and a visionary whose contributions helped shape the sound of classic soul and R&B.
