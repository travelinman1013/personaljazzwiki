## Biography
Beau Jocque, born Andrus Espre on November 1, 1953, in Duralde, Louisiana, was a towering figure in the world of zydeco music, known for his powerful stage presence and innovative fusion of traditional Creole sounds with rock, funk, and blues. After serving nine years in the Air Force and working in an oil refinery, Espre suffered a serious work-related accident in 1987 that left him temporarily paralyzed. During his recovery, he began playing his father's button accordion, which sparked his musical journey. By 1991, he formed Beau Jocque & the Zydeco Hi-Rollers, quickly gaining popularity for their energetic live performances and modernized zydeco sound. His band, which included his wife Shelly on rubboard, became one of the most in-demand acts on the Louisiana zydeco circuit, headlining major tours and festivals throughout the 1990s.

Beau Jocque's music was characterized by his gruff vocals, dynamic rhythms, and a willingness to incorporate rock guitar solos, blues-rock beats, and even rap lines into his songs. He recorded and performed in Louisiana French, Creole, and English, making his music accessible to a broad audience. His debut album, 'Beau Jocque Boogie,' became the highest-selling zydeco album of all time, and his subsequent releases cemented his reputation as a trailblazer in the genre. Beau Jocque and the Zydeco Hi-Rollers won multiple Big Easy Music Awards and were celebrated for revitalizing zydeco for a new generation. Tragically, Beau Jocque died of a heart attack in 1999 at the age of 45, but his legacy as a transformative force in zydeco endures.
