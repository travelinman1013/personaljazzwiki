## Biography
Blue Lu Barker, born Louise Dupont on November 13, 1913, in New Orleans, Louisiana, was a celebrated American jazz and blues singer whose career spanned several decades. Raised in a vibrant musical environment, she left school at age 13 and soon married guitarist Danny Barker. The couple moved to New York City in 1930, where Blue Lu began performing in various venues and quickly established herself in the jazz and blues scenes. Her early exposure to the lively musical culture of New Orleans and her partnership with Danny Barker shaped her unique vocal style, characterized by a blend of swing, blues, and playful, risqué lyricism.

Blue Lu's breakthrough came in 1938 with her recording of 'Don’t You Feel My Leg' (also known as 'Don’t You Make Me High'), a song co-written with her husband. The track became an immediate hit and remains her signature tune, later revived by artists such as Maria Muldaur. Throughout the 1930s and 1940s, she recorded for prominent labels like Decca, Apollo, and Capitol, often collaborating with jazz luminaries and performing alongside legends such as Cab Calloway and Jelly Roll Morton. Despite a hiatus from 1949 to 1964, she returned to New Orleans and continued performing, making her final recording at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival in 1998, shortly before her death.

Blue Lu Barker's legacy endures as a pioneering female voice in jazz and blues, celebrated for her witty, expressive delivery and her role in shaping the New Orleans sound. She was inducted into the Louisiana Blues Hall of Fame in 1997, and her influence is acknowledged by both critics and fellow musicians, including Billie Holiday, who cited Barker as a major inspiration.
