## Biography
Fred Hersch, Drew Gress, and Joey Baron form a contemporary jazz piano trio rather than a spoken-word act, bringing together three of the most distinctive voices in modern improvisation. Pianist **Fred Hersch** (born October 21, 1955, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA) emerged from the 1970s New York jazz scene and has since become a major figure in jazz piano, known for his lyrical touch, contrapuntal independence, and deep engagement with the American songbook and contemporary composition.[4][5] Bassist **Drew Gress** and drummer **Joey Baron** have been long‑standing associates of Hersch since the late 1980s and early 1990s respectively, appearing with him in various configurations across more than a dozen recordings before converging as a dedicated studio trio.[3] Their work together crystallized on Hersch’s ECM recording *The Surrounding Green*, tracked in May 2024 in Lugano, Switzerland, which showcases the trio’s blend of standards, modern jazz classics, and Hersch originals.[1][3]

Across this ensemble, the three musicians cultivate a chamber‑like sense of interaction: Hersch’s melodic and harmonically rich piano is balanced by Gress’s agile, singing bass lines and Baron’s highly responsive, often understated drumming.[1][3] Critics have highlighted the **empathy, sensitivity, and three‑way communication** that define their performances, noting that every phrase and dynamic shift reflects decades of shared experience on bandstands and recordings.[1][3] Although Hersch has led several acclaimed trios over the years, this particular combination with Gress and Baron marks a significant chapter in his late‑career output, extending his reputation—already cemented by multiple Grammy nominations and Village Vanguard residencies—into a new ECM‑documented phase that emphasizes spacious sound, subtle rhythmic elasticity, and a refined balance between composition and improvisation.[4][5]

The trio’s legacy, while still evolving, sits within the broader influence Hersch has exerted as an educator and bandleader: his earlier trios were praised by publications such as *DownBeat* and *The New Yorker* as major ensembles of their time, and the new Gress–Baron configuration continues that lineage with a more European‑inflected, ECM aesthetic.[5][7] *The Surrounding Green* and associated live performances (including festival appearances such as Treviso Suona Jazz in Italy) underscore how these three veteran musicians have turned a long‑running informal partnership into a fully realized group concept, contributing an “essential entry into the piano trio canon” that deepens Hersch’s standing in jazz while spotlighting Gress and Baron as equal narrative voices rather than mere accompanists.[1][3][4]

## Fun Facts
- Fred Hersch was the **first jazz musician to play week‑long solo piano engagements at the Village Vanguard** in New York City, a venue traditionally associated with trios and larger groups.[4]
- Hersch, Drew Gress, and Joey Baron had worked together in different combinations for decades, yet *The Surrounding Green* is **their first-ever studio album as a dedicated trio**, recorded only in May 2024.[1][3][8]
- Critics have linked the new trio’s interpretation of Ornette Coleman’s “Law Years” on *The Surrounding Green* to Hersch’s broader commitment to re‑imagining modern jazz repertoire, balancing swing and restraint without disturbing the trio’s overall equilibrium.[1]
- Jazz writer Jason Moran once compared Fred Hersch’s command of the piano to **LeBron James on the basketball court**, emphasizing Hersch’s combination of virtuosity and control—an ethos that shapes his trio work with Gress and Baron.[5]

- [[charlie_haden|Charlie Haden]] - Legendary bassist who played in an earlier Fred Hersch trio that foreshadowed the interactive, lyrical aesthetic of later groups. (*Sarabande* (1987), a trio album with Hersch, Haden, and Baron referenced in discussions of *The Surrounding Green*.) [Mid‑1980s[1]]
- [[esperanza_spalding|esperanza spalding]] - Duo partner of Hersch on a highly acclaimed live recording, reflecting his collaborative range beyond the piano trio format.

### Artists Influenced
- [[brad_mehldau|Brad Mehldau]] - One of Fred Hersch’s former students; Hersch’s harmonic language, lyricism, and trio approach helped shape Mehldau’s development. (Mehldau’s later trio recordings bear the mark of Hersch’s emphasis on song form and contrapuntal independence (as noted in Hersch’s own bio).) [Student years in the late 1980s/early 1990s and ongoing influence.[5]]
- [[sullivan_fortner|Sullivan Fortner]] - Another former student of Hersch, influenced by his touch, voicings, and integration of standards with original material.

- [[dan_tepfer|Dan Tepfer]] - Pianist and former student who absorbed Hersch’s focus on improvisational architecture and interaction, relevant to contemporary trio practices.

- [[ethan_iverson|Ethan Iverson]] - Former Hersch student whose later work with The Bad Plus and as a solo artist acknowledges the impact of Hersch’s harmonic and structural ideas.
