## Biography
Zephire Andre Williams was born on November 1, 1936, in Bessemer, Alabama, but was raised in the projects of Chicago, Illinois, where he sang in the choir at Cobbs Baptist Church and briefly served in the U.S. Navy[1]. His musical career began in Detroit in the early 1950s, where he quickly became a standout in the city’s R&B scene, winning amateur contests and catching the attention of Fortune Records[2]. Williams joined the vocal group The Five Dollars (later known as the Don Juans) and became their flamboyant frontman, known for his wild stage antics and rhythmic spoken-word delivery—a style that would later be recognized as a precursor to rap[1][2]. His 1956 hit “Bacon Fat” became a major R&B success, peaking at #9 on the Billboard R&B chart, and established his reputation for songs filled with humor and sexual innuendo[1][3]. After leaving Fortune, Williams wrote and produced for Motown artists, co-writing Stevie Wonder’s debut single “Thank You for Loving Me” and working with Mary Wells, the Contours, and Edwin Starr, whom he also managed[1]. In the 1960s, he signed with Chess Records in Chicago, releasing funk-infused singles like “The Stroke” and “Cadillac Jack,” and collaborated with Ike Turner before personal struggles derailed his career[1][2]. Williams experienced a creative resurgence in the 1990s, recording new albums with artists like Jon Spencer and the Sadies, and remained active until his death from colon cancer in Chicago on March 17, 2019[1]. His legacy endures as a pioneer of rhythm and blues, early funk, and a stylistic forerunner to hip-hop.

## Fun Facts
- Andre Williams earned the nickname 'Mr. Rhythm' from comedian Redd Foxx due to his dynamic stage presence[1].
- He once performed a stunt where he would fall from a balcony at the Graystone Ballroom, be carried back to the stage, and suddenly jump up to dance, astonishing audiences[2].
- Williams’ song “Bacon Fat” was so successful that Fortune Records sold the distribution rights to the larger Epic Records[3].
- A documentary about his life, 'Agile Mobile Hostile: A Year with Andre Williams', was released in 2008[1].
