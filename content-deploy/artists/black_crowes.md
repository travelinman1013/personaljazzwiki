## Biography
The Black Crowes are an American rock band formed in 1984 in Atlanta, Georgia (specifically Marietta suburb), by brothers Chris Robinson (vocals, rhythm guitar) and Rich Robinson (lead guitar), while attending Walton High School. Initially named Mr. Crowe's Garden after a children's book, the band drew early influences from local acts like R.E.M., 1960s psychedelic pop, and Southern rock, evolving into a revivalist blues rock outfit inspired by 1970s acts. After recording demos and playing clubs like CBGB, they signed with Def American Recordings in 1989 under producer George Drakoulias, who introduced them to The Faces and Humble Pie, prompting covers of the Rolling Stones and a name change to The Black Crowes.[1][2][3]

Their 1990 debut album *Shake Your Money Maker* became a commercial breakthrough, featuring hits like the Otis Redding cover 'Hard to Handle' and 'She Talks to Angels,' reaching top 30 on Billboard Hot 100. Follow-ups *The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion* (1992) topped the Billboard 200, while *Amorica* (1994) showcased their raw style amid lineup changes and internal tensions. Marked by high member turnover, the band—always driven by the Robinsons—released ten studio albums, navigated breakups (e.g., 2015 dissolution, 2019 reunion), and toured with legends like ZZ Top (from which they were fired for anti-corporate rants), AC/DC, and Robert Plant. Their sound blends **southern rock**, **jam band** elements, and bluesy hard rock.[1][5][6]

The Black Crowes' legacy endures with over 35 million records sold, Grammy nominations (e.g., *Happiness Bastards* in 2024 for Best Rock Album), and a 2025 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame nomination. Despite sabbaticals and drama including addiction and label disputes, their prolific output, live prowess (e.g., Jimmy Page joining tours), and Rolling Stone ranking at #92 on greatest artists list cement their revivalist status in rock.[1][2][5]
