## Biography
Johnny Wakelin, born John Raymond Leonard Wakelin in 1939 in Brighton, Sussex, England, began his music career in the local vocals circuit where he was discovered by Robin Blanchflower, who had previously launched Carl Douglas.[5][1][3] His breakthrough came in 1974 inspired by Muhammad Ali's 'Rumble in the Jungle' fight against George Foreman in Kinshasa, Zaire, leading to his debut single 'Black Superman (Muhammad Ali)', which gained traction after Ali's visit to Britain.[1][2] This was followed by 'In Zaire' in 1976 from his album 'Reggae, Soul and Rock & Roll', peaking at No. 4 in the UK, No. 2 in Germany, and charting in Australia and the USA; subsequent hits included 'African Man' and 'Tennessee Hero'.[1][2]

Wakelin's style blended reggae, soul, rock & roll, and pop, often with upbeat rhythms and themes tied to boxing icons like Ali and Prince Naseem Hamed, as seen in tracks like 'The Naz'.[1][2] From 1980 to 2004, he toured Europe, Australia, and the USA, appeared on TV shows such as Top of the Pops, Paul Hogan Show, and performed as guest singer with the James Last Orchestra, including Las Vegas gigs in 2003-2004.[1][3] He continued writing hundreds of songs and recording in studios during breaks.[1]

In 2005-2006, renewed interest in 70s/80s stars brought him back to European TV like Cabrio Hits, and he released 'Right Before My Eyes' featuring new tracks alongside re-recordings of his hits, demonstrating his enduring versatility across mainstream pop, reggae, and ballads.[1][2] Compilations like 'Best of 40 Years' (2016) and singles such as 'Pebble On the Beach' (2013) highlight his lasting career.[2]
