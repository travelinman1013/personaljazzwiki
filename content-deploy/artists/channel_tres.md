## Biography
Sheldon Jerome Young, professionally known as Channel Tres, was born on May 26, 1991, in Compton, California, where he was raised by his grandparents to a soundtrack of soul and funk greats. He began his career as a session musician and producer, working behind the scenes for artists like Kehlani, JPEGMAFIA, and Duckwrth before adopting his moniker in 2016. Channel Tres emerged from Compton's musical scene as a purveyor of innovation, pushing the traditional spirit of West Coast rap into unexplored territories by developing his signature "Compton House" sound—a distinctive blend that marries the raunchy bounce of West Coast hip-hop with house music's Midwestern foundation, incorporating elements of G-funk, disco, funk, and psychedelia.

Channel Tres released his self-titled debut EP in 2018, establishing the foundation for his distinctive hip-house style characterized by a mastery of rhythm and the rare ability to make songs simultaneously sinister and fluorescent. His breakthrough came with the single "Controller," followed by high-profile collaborations including "Fuego" with Tyler, The Creator during the pandemic lockdown. His EP "i can't go outside" debuted in Spotify's Top 10 US Album Debuts, further solidifying his presence in the music industry. In 2024, he released his debut album "Head Rush" on RCA Records, which showcases his evolution as an artist and represents a deeply personal project addressing themes of trauma, loss, and his journey from childhood in Compton to becoming a globally recognized innovator.

Throughout his career, Channel Tres has performed at major festivals worldwide, from Miami to Sydney, and has sold out headline tours globally. Known for his commanding stage presence—performing in glitter and sequins with carefully choreographed movements—and his deep, hypnotic voice, he has established himself as a visionary who refuses simple categorization. At over 30 years old, Channel Tres remains committed to authenticity and artistic integrity, prioritizing meaningful and flowing music over industry conventions, and continues to reshape the boundaries imposed on him by the music industry.
