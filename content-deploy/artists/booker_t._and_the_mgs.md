## Biography
Booker T. & the M.G.'s emerged in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1962 as the house band for Stax Records, quickly becoming one of the most influential instrumental groups in American music history[1][3]. The original lineup—Booker T. Jones (organ, piano), Steve Cropper (guitar), Lewie Steinberg (bass), and Al Jackson Jr. (drums)—was forged during a spontaneous studio jam, which produced their signature hit, 'Green Onions,' a million-selling single that defined the Memphis soul sound[1][3][6]. Their tight, groove-driven instrumentals became the backbone for countless Stax recordings, backing legends like Otis Redding, Wilson Pickett, Sam & Dave, and Carla Thomas, while also releasing their own acclaimed albums[1][3]. The group was notable not only for their musical innovation but also for their racial integration at a time when soul music was largely segregated[1][3]. After Steinberg’s departure in 1965, Donald 'Duck' Dunn joined on bass, solidifying the classic quartet until Jackson’s tragic murder in 1975[1][3]. Despite lineup changes and periods of hiatus, Booker T. & the M.G.'s remained active, reuniting for tours and recordings, and were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992[1][3]. Their legacy endures as pioneers of Southern soul and as a symbol of musical unity.
