## Biography
Woodenhead is an instrumental rock fusion band formed in 1975 in New Orleans by guitarist Jimmy Robinson and cellist Danny Cassin, both students at Loyola University's music department. Despite their classical training, the band drew from rock, progressive rock, and fusion influences including Frank Zappa, Yes, Dixie Dregs, the Beatles, Hendrix, the Byrds, and Cream, creating a dynamic sound blending composed sections with intricate interplay.[1][2][3][7][8] Jimmy Robinson, who had previously fronted the progrock band Laugh In The Dark in the 1970s, led Woodenhead through decades of persistence in the competitive New Orleans music scene.[2][3]

The band's career spanned over 50 years, releasing at least six albums, including the 2004 live recording *Perseverance*, which featured lineup changes such as Fran Cominsky on keys, Paul Clement on bass, Mark Whitaker on drums, and guest appearances by the horn section 'Trombones From Hell' (Mark Mullins, Brian O’Neil, Rick Trolsen).[3][9] Woodenhead's music is characterized by technical proficiency, rapid shifts between melodic sections, and influences from Zappa-esque complexity to Celtic-flavored prog fusion, earning praise as one of New Orleans' most fascinating musical units.[1][3][9]

Woodenhead's legacy endures as a staple of the New Orleans progressive and fusion scene, with Robinson's guitar work blowing minds of audiences since 1975, maintaining a cult following among fans of Yes, King Crimson, and Mahavishnu Orchestra despite limited mainstream recognition.[3][5]
