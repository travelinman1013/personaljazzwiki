## Biography
The Texas Horns are a three-piece horn section and band rooted in the Texas blues tradition, coalescing in the late 1990s around tenor saxophonist Mark “Kaz” Kazanoff, baritone saxophonist John Mills, and trumpeter Al (Adalberto) Gomez.[1][2][3][6] Kazanoff, originally from Massachusetts and seasoned in the Chicago and Austin blues scenes, had long worked as a saxophonist, arranger, and producer, playing with legends such as Big Walter Horton, James Cotton, Muddy Waters, and Otis Rush before settling in Austin and joining the house band at Antone’s in 1982.[1] Mills came from the jazz and roots milieu (including work on the 1999 “Lone Star Shootout” session), while Gomez brought experience from Doug Sahm’s “Last Real Texas Blues Band,” giving the trio a shared foundation in blues, soul, R&B, and roots music.[1][3] By the late 1990s they began appearing on records explicitly as **The Texas Horns**, quickly becoming an in-demand section for touring artists, festivals, and studio projects.[1][3][6]

For roughly their first decade, The Texas Horns focused on being a premier backing and festival horn section rather than a standalone recording act, serving as the house horn section for major events like Ottawa Bluesfest (where they have held a long-running residency) and working with American bands such as the Allman Brothers and many Texas-based blues and roots artists.[1][6][7] Their sound blends hard‑driving Texas blues, boogie‑woogie, and soul with tightly arranged horn lines and improvisational jazz elements, emphasizing punchy section work, melodic solos, and groove‑forward arrangements.[1][3][6] After years of supporting others, they stepped into the spotlight with their own debut album, **“Blues Gotta Holda Me”** (2015, Vizztone), followed by **“Get Here Quick”** (2019, Severn Records) and **“Everybody Let’s Roll”** (2022, Blue Heart Records), each featuring a large cast of guest vocalists and instrumentalists while showcasing their original writing and arranging.[1][3][4][6] Over more than two decades, The Texas Horns have earned a reputation as one of the preeminent modern blues horn sections, bridging traditional Texas roadhouse sounds with contemporary roots and soul, and leaving a distinct imprint on countless recordings and festival stages.[1][3][4][6][7]

## Fun Facts
- Before The Texas Horns ever recorded under their own name, the trio spent roughly a decade primarily as a backing and festival horn section, only stepping out front with their debut album “Blues Gotta Holda Me” in 2015.[1][3][6][7]
- The core members—Mark “Kaz” Kazanoff, John Mills, and Al Gomez—first intersected on other notable projects, including Doug Sahm’s “Last Real Texas Blues Band” and the 1999 “Lone Star Shootout” album, before formalizing themselves as The Texas Horns.[1][3]
- At Ottawa Bluesfest, The Texas Horns have effectively become part of the festival’s sonic identity, serving as house horns for more than 15 years and backing a rotating cast of international blues and roots artists.[1][6][7]
- Collectively, Mark “Kaz” Kazanoff has played on around 200 recording sessions, so The Texas Horns’ sound is built on decades of cumulative studio and road experience distilled into a tight three‑piece section.[3]
