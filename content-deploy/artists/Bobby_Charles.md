## Biography
Bobby Charles, born Robert Charles Guidry on February 21, 1938, in Abbeville, Louisiana, grew up immersed in the Cajun musical traditions of southern Louisiana. As a teenager, he became captivated by the sounds of rhythm & blues and early rock & roll, drawing inspiration from artists like Fats Domino, Lloyd Price, and Guitar Slim. Charles began performing with local bands such as the Cardinals (later the Clippers), and by his late teens, he had written 'See You Later, Alligator,' a song that would become a rock & roll standard after being popularized by Bill Haley & His Comets. His unique blend of Cajun, R&B, and swamp pop styles set him apart, and his vocal delivery often led listeners to mistake him for a Black artist, despite his Cajun heritage.

Charles's songwriting prowess became his greatest legacy. He penned several major hits for other artists, including 'Walking to New Orleans' and 'It Keeps Rainin'' for Fats Domino, and '(I Don't Know Why) But I Do' for Clarence 'Frogman' Henry. He recorded for Chess Records in the 1950s and later collaborated with a wide range of musicians, including Dr. John, The Band, and Neil Young. Charles was invited to perform at The Band's legendary 'Last Waltz' concert in 1976, cementing his place among influential American songwriters. Despite periods of retreat from the spotlight, he continued to release albums and remained a revered figure in Louisiana music until his death in 2010.

Bobby Charles's music is characterized by its laid-back, swampy grooves and heartfelt lyricism, blending Cajun rhythms with R&B sensibilities. His influence can be heard in the works of countless Louisiana musicians and beyond, and his songs remain staples of American popular music. Though he never achieved the mainstream fame of some of his contemporaries, Charles is celebrated as a pioneer of swamp pop and a bridge between Cajun culture and the broader currents of American roots music.
