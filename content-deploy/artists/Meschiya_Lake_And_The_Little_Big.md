## Biography
Meschiya Lake is a New Orleans-based jazz and traditional music vocalist who leads the acclaimed band Meschiya Lake and the Little Big Horns. Born in Grants Pass, Oregon, and raised in South Dakota, Lake's musical journey began at the remarkably young age of nine when she won an adults-only singing contest at a South Dakota steakhouse, earning $500 and a regular gig that paid $25 per song at the South Dakota Opry. Her unconventional path to jazz stardom took a dramatic turn in 2000 when she arrived in New Orleans as a glass eater with the Know Nothing Family Zirkus Zideshow and End of the World Circus, a traveling sideshow where she performed thrilling acts including glass and insect eating and fire dancing with flame-doused nunchucks.

Immediately captivated by New Orleans' unique culture and musical heritage, Lake made the Crescent City her permanent home and immersed herself in its rich jazz traditions. In 2007, she joined the traditional jazz outfit The Loose Marbles on Royal Street, beginning what she calls her "jazz boot camp" and completely dedicating herself to mastering the genre. Unsatisfied with being a sideman, she formed her own group, The Little Big Horns, in 2009. The band's debut album Lucky Devil was released and honored by NPR's All Things Considered as one of David Kunian's favorite albums of 2010, followed by Fooler's Gold in 2013 and Bad Kids Club. Lake also formed the country-influenced duo Magnolia Beacon with singer Erika Lewis in 2007, exploring darker, melodic compositions that showcased her versatility beyond jazz.

Lake's powerful pre-microphone singing style has been described by The New Yorker's Dan Baum as opening "her throat like an air raid siren to croon in a thrilling pre-microphone style that can make you feel by turns as though you were shivering around a campfire in a railroad yard or drinking in a Budapest nightclub in 1938." Her career has taken her to prestigious venues including Lincoln Center and major international festivals across the United States, Brazil, Denmark, the Netherlands, Russia, and the United Kingdom. She was crowned First Lady of Jazz at the 2013 Sun Valley Jazz Festival and won Female Performer of the Year three years running at the Big Easy Awards. In New Orleans, she was named Best Female Singer in Offbeat Magazine's Best of the Beat poll in 2013 and 2014, while the Little Big Horns received the coveted Best Trad Band award in 2013. Lake has also collaborated with notable musicians including Alec Ounsworth of Clap Your Hands Say Yeah and Tom Waits, and she lectures on jazz and blues history while continuing to perform regularly in New Orleans.
