## Biography
The Isley Brothers are an American music group that originated in the early 1950s in Cincinnati, Ohio. The founding members were brothers Ronald, O'Kelly, Rudolph, and Vernon Isley, who began their musical journey performing gospel in local churches. After Vernon's tragic death in 1955, the remaining trio continued, eventually relocating to New York City and recording doo-wop songs for small labels. Their breakthrough came in 1959 with the hit 'Shout,' which launched their career and established their reputation for energetic performances. Over the decades, the group evolved musically, incorporating elements of rock, soul, funk, and R&B, and adapting their sound to changing trends. They achieved mainstream success with Motown in the 1960s, notably with 'This Old Heart of Mine (Is Weak for You),' before returning to their own label, T-Neck Records, where they developed a funkier, more innovative style. The addition of younger brothers Ernie and Marvin Isley, along with brother-in-law Chris Jasper in 1973, transformed the group into a full band, leading to a string of top-selling albums such as '3 + 3' and 'The Heat Is On.' Despite numerous lineup changes and personal tragedies, including the deaths of several members, Ronald and Ernie Isley have continued to perform and record, maintaining the group's legacy into the 21st century. The Isley Brothers have been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, cementing their status as pioneers in American music.
