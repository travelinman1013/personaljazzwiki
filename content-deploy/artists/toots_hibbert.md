## Biography
Frederick Nathaniel “Toots” Hibbert, OJ (8 December 1942 – 11 September 2020) was a Jamaican singer, songwriter, and bandleader best known as the electrifying lead vocalist of **Toots and the Maytals**, one of the foundational groups in ska, rocksteady, and reggae.[1][3] Born the youngest of seven children in May Pen, Clarendon, Jamaica, he was raised by parents who were both preachers and first developed his powerful, gospel-infused voice singing in church.[3][4] After his mother died when he was about eight and his father a few years later, Hibbert moved as a teenager to the Trenchtown area of Kingston, a crucible of Jamaican popular music, where he lived with his older brother and worked in a barbershop.[2][3] In 1962, after being overheard singing at work, he formed the vocal trio the Maytals with Jerry Mathias and Raleigh Gordon, soon recording for Coxsone Dodd’s Studio One and scoring early hits like “Fever” and the gospel-rooted “Six and Seven Books of Moses.”[1][3]

Through the 1960s and early 1970s, Hibbert and the Maytals stood at the center of Jamaica’s shifting musical landscape, moving from ska to rocksteady and then into what became known as reggae.[2][3] Hibbert’s soulful, raspy delivery—often compared to American soul greats like Otis Redding and Ray Charles—was paired with tightly arranged vocal harmonies and rhythms that blended Jamaican mento, ska, and rocksteady with gospel, R&B, and rock & roll.[1][3] After a brief prison term in the mid‑1960s (on a marijuana charge he always maintained was wrongful), he turned the experience into the rocksteady classic “54-46 Was My Number,” released in 1968.[2][3] That same year, the Maytals released “Do the Reggay,” widely credited with coining the very word **reggae** and heralding a new, more syncopated, danceable sound that would define Jamaican music.[1][2][3] The group repeatedly won Jamaica’s Independence Festival song competition with anthems like “Bam Bam,” and their songs “Pressure Drop” and “Sweet and Dandy” appeared in the 1972 film *The Harder They Come*, helping introduce reggae to international audiences.[1][3]

By the 1970s, Toots and the Maytals were touring globally, releasing acclaimed albums such as *Funky Kingston*, *In the Dark*, and *Reggae Got Soul*, and sharing stages with rock acts including The Who and the Eagles, while their music became influential in the emerging punk scene; The Clash and others notably covered “Pressure Drop.”[1][3] In 1980, the band set a Guinness World Record by recording, pressing, and releasing the live album *Live at the Palais* within 24 hours.[1][3] After the original trio split in the early 1980s, Hibbert continued as a solo artist, earning his first Grammy nomination with *Toots in Memphis* (1988), and later re-forming Toots and the Maytals in the mid‑1990s with a new lineup.[1][3] The album *True Love* (2004), featuring star-studded collaborations, won the Grammy Award for Best Reggae Album, and the band’s 2020 album *Got to Be Tough* was released shortly before Hibbert’s death from COVID‑19 complications in Kingston at age 77.[1][3][4][6] Over six decades, Hibbert’s fusion of gospel passion, Jamaican rhythms, and socially conscious lyrics made him a central architect of reggae and a lasting influence on generations of musicians worldwide.[1][2][3][4]
