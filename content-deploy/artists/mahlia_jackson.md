## Biography
Mahalia Jackson, born on October 26, 1911, in New Orleans, Louisiana, emerged from humble beginnings to become one of the most influential gospel singers in history. Raised in a strict religious household, she began singing in church choirs as a child and was deeply influenced by the spirituals and hymns of her community. After her mother's death, Jackson moved to Chicago as a teenager, where she joined the Greater Salem Baptist Church choir and soon became a member of the Johnson Gospel Singers, one of the first gospel groups to tour widely[2][4].

Jackson's career flourished in the late 1930s and 1940s as she developed a unique style that blended traditional gospel with elements of jazz and blues, despite her family's disapproval of secular music. Her 1947 recording of "Move On Up a Little Higher" became a groundbreaking hit, propelling her to national and international fame. Known for her powerful contralto voice and emotive delivery, she became a central figure in the Civil Rights Movement, performing at major events such as the 1963 March on Washington at the request of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr[2][4].

Throughout her life, Mahalia Jackson broke racial barriers and brought gospel music to mainstream audiences worldwide. She was the first gospel artist to win a Grammy Award and was inducted into the Gospel Music Hall of Fame. Her legacy endures as a symbol of faith, resilience, and the transcendent power of music[1][2].
