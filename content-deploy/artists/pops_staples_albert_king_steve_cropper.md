## Biography
Roebuck 'Pops' Staples was born in Winona, Mississippi, and began his musical journey singing with the Trumpet Jubilees while working in stockyards, construction, and a steel mill. In 1948, he formed the Staple Singers with his wife Oceola and children Mavis, Cleotha, Pervis, and Yvonne, initially performing gospel in local churches. They recorded early singles for United and Vee-Jay Records in the 1950s, including 'Uncloudy Day' and 'This May Be the Last Time' (later adapted by The Rolling Stones).[1][2][3]

In the 1960s, the Staple Singers transitioned to Riverside, Epic, and Stax Records, incorporating protest and inspirational music tied to the civil rights and anti-war movements, with hits like 'Respect Yourself,' 'I'll Take You There' (US #1 in 1972), and 'If You're Ready (Come Go with Me).' Pops pioneered blues guitar in gospel music in the 1930s and collaborated on the 1969 blues album *Jammed Together* with Albert King and Steve Cropper. The group achieved further success with Curtis Mayfield-produced 'Let's Do It Again' in 1975.[1][2][3][5]

In the 1980s, after his children pursued solo paths, Pops launched a solo career, releasing albums like *Peace to the Neighborhood* (1992) and winning a 1995 Grammy for Best Contemporary Blues Album for *Father, Father*. He received a National Heritage Fellowship in 1998, the Staple Singers were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1999, and he was honored with a Mississippi Blues Trail marker in 2010 and Blues Hall of Fame induction in 2018. Pops Staples died on December 19, 2000, after a fall.[1][3][5]
