## Biography
Ben Sidran, born August 14, 1943, in Chicago and raised in Racine, Wisconsin, is a celebrated American jazz and rock keyboardist, producer, songwriter, broadcaster, and author. He discovered jazz as a teenager and began performing boogie-woogie piano at local events before enrolling at the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1961. There, he joined The Ardells alongside Steve Miller and Boz Scaggs, but chose to complete his English literature degree while his bandmates pursued music careers on the West Coast. After graduating, Sidran moved to England to pursue a PhD at the University of Sussex, where he also worked as a session musician for artists such as Eric Clapton, The Rolling Stones, Peter Frampton, and Charlie Watts.

Sidran's career blossomed with his return to the United States, where he became a key collaborator with Steve Miller, co-writing the hit "Space Cowboy" and contributing to several Steve Miller Band albums. He released his own debut as a leader, 'Feel Your Groove,' in 1971 and went on to produce records for notable artists including Mose Allison, Van Morrison, Diana Ross, Rickie Lee Jones, and Michael Franks. Sidran is also renowned for his work as a broadcaster, hosting NPR's Peabody Award-winning 'Jazz Alive' and VH1's Ace Award-winning 'New Visions' series, as well as for his scholarship, authoring influential books like 'Black Talk' and 'Talking Jazz.'

Known for blending jazz with R&B, rock, and witty lyricism, Sidran has released over forty solo albums and composed soundtracks for acclaimed films such as 'Hoop Dreams.' He is recognized as a bridge between jazz and popular music, and his legacy extends through his teaching, broadcasting, and prolific output as both a musician and writer.
