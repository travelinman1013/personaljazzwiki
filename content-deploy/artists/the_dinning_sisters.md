## Biography
The Dinning Sisters were an American vocal trio formed by sisters Ella Lucille "Lou" Dinning, Eugenia Doy "Jean" Dinning, and Virginia Moy "Ginger" Dinning, who were born in Caldwell, Kansas and raised in Oklahoma. Coming from a family of nine children who sang harmony in church, the sisters began performing together in the late 1930s, quickly gaining attention for their close harmonies and winning amateur contests. By 1939, they had their own radio program in Chicago and soon gained national exposure on the NBC 'Blue Network' show 'National Barn Dance.'

Their career flourished in the 1940s as they signed with Capitol Records and became known as competitors to the Andrews Sisters, another popular harmony group of the era. The Dinning Sisters scored several hits, including the top-10 songs "My Adobe Hacienda" (1947) and "Buttons and Bows" (1948), and appeared in Hollywood films such as 'Throw a Saddle on a Star' (1946) and Disney's 'Melody Time' (1948). Over the years, the lineup changed: Lou left in 1946, replaced by Jayne Bundesen, and later their younger sister Dolores "Tootsie" Dinning joined the group. The trio continued recording and performing until 1955, after which Jean and Dolores pursued successful careers in songwriting and session singing, respectively.

Musically, the Dinning Sisters were known for their bright, intricate harmonies and a style that blended pop, swing, and jazz influences, reminiscent of the Boswell Sisters and Andrews Sisters. Their legacy includes not only their chart successes and film appearances but also their influence on later vocal groups and their continued work in the music industry, with Jean co-writing the hit "Teen Angel" and Dolores co-founding the renowned backing vocal group The Nashville Edition.
