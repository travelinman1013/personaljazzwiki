## Biography
Aurelio Martínez Suazo (26 September 1969 – 17 March 2025) was a Honduran singer-songwriter, guitarist, and cultural ambassador of the Garifuna people. Born in the small Caribbean village of Plaplaya, Honduras, Aurelio grew up immersed in Garifuna musical traditions, learning from his father—a local troubadour who improvised paranda songs—and his musically gifted mother. He began performing at Garifuna ceremonies as a child and by age 14 had become a respected musician with deep knowledge of Garifuna rhythms, rituals, and songs. At age 15, he struck out to find professional work as a musician, eventually settling in La Ceiba where he formed his first group, Lita Ariran, one of the first Garifuna traditional music and dance ensembles to gain international recognition, particularly in Japan.

Throughout his career, Aurelio became recognized as the greatest living interpreter of paranda music, a genre often compared to the blues for its bittersweet melodies and sharp social commentary. He initially gained popularity performing punta rock with his band Aurelio y Los Bravos del Caribe, scoring national hits including "Pompis con pompis." However, his artistic vision evolved toward preserving and elevating traditional paranda music. His 2004 solo album "Garifuna Soul" marked a turning point, establishing him as a serious tradition-bearer. His 2007 participation in the album "Watina" with Andy Palacio and The Garifuna Collective earned the prestigious WOMEX Award and was later declared the Greatest World Music Album of All Times by Amazon.com in 2010. His 2017 compilation album "Darandi" (Garifuna for "thirty") celebrated three decades of paranda composition and performance.

Beyond music, Aurelio made significant cultural and political contributions. In 2005, he became the first Afro-Honduran elected to the National Congress, advocating for Garifuna rights and visibility. He performed at the world's most prestigious stages, including a historic NPR Music Tiny Desk performance as the first Honduran artist featured in the series. His work was recognized internationally through the Rolex Mentor and Protégé Arts Initiative, where he collaborated with legendary musician Youssou N'Dour, and a 2022 Mellon Fellowship at New York University. His album "Laru Beya" was ranked among the best albums of Latin American music by Los 600 de Latinoamérica in 2024. Aurelio passed away on 17 March 2025, leaving behind an immense legacy as a guardian of Garifuna heritage and a bridge between generations.
