## Biography
Mutabaruka, born Allan Hope on December 26, 1952, in Rae Town, Kingston, Jamaica, is a pioneering Rastafari dub poet, musician, actor, educator, and talk-show host[1][4]. Raised in a Roman Catholic household, he lost his father at age eight and later attended Kingston Technical High School, training in electronics before working at the Jamaican Telephone Company. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Mutabaruka became deeply involved in the Black awareness movement, reading progressive and often banned literature such as Eldridge Cleaver's 'Soul on Ice' and 'The Autobiography of Malcolm X.' This period marked his transition to Rastafarianism, a shift that influenced both his lifestyle and creative output[1][4].

In 1971, Mutabaruka left Kingston for the Potosi Hills in St. James, seeking a more spiritual existence. He began publishing poetry in Swing magazine and quickly gained recognition for his powerful, socially conscious verse. His early works, such as 'Outcry' (1973) and 'Wailin'' (1974), addressed themes of Black liberation, social oppression, and resistance. By the late 1970s, he was performing live with his band Truth and achieved national success with tracks like 'Outcry,' backed by Cedric Brooks' Light of Saba. His collaborations with guitarist Earl 'Chinna' Smith, notably on 'Every Time a Ear Di Sound,' further solidified his reputation as a leading voice in Jamaican dub poetry[1][3].

Mutabaruka's musical style is characterized by spoken word performances grounded in reggae and dub rhythms, often addressing politics, culture, poverty, racism, sexism, and religion. He is credited with developing two of Jamaica's most popular radio programs, 'The Cutting Edge' and 'Steppin' Razor,' and his work has influenced generations of poets and musicians worldwide. His legacy is that of a fearless commentator and cultural icon whose art continues to challenge and inspire[1][7].
