## Biography
Steve Riley and the Mamou Playboys are an American Cajun band from southern Louisiana that formed in 1988, when Steve Riley co-founded the group with fiddler David Greely at the age of 18.[1][2] Born in Mamou, Louisiana in 1969, Steve Riley demonstrated exceptional musical talent from an early age, playing accordion by age 7 and touring with legendary Cajun musician Dewey Balfa by age 16.[6] Riley's mastery of the accordion, combined with his searing emotional vocals, songwriting abilities, and commanding stage presence, established him as a major force in Cajun culture. The band's stunningly clean and cohesive performance of Cajun French music from Southwest Louisiana propelled them into the world music limelight early on, and by their third album release, Trace of Time, they had garnered their first Grammy nomination in the traditional folk music category.[1][8]

Over more than three decades, Steve Riley and the Mamou Playboys have recorded 10 albums, nine of which were released on Rounder Records, establishing themselves as one of the most prolific and respected Cajun bands in the world.[3] The band's musical style evolved from exclusively traditional music influenced by their mentors to a more personal approach that incorporates zydeco, swamp pop, and other musical styles while maintaining a distinctively Cajun sound.[6] Beyond his work with the Mamou Playboys, Steve Riley has collaborated with internationally renowned artists including Eric Clapton, Robert Plant, Elvis Costello, Willie Nelson, and Paul Simon, and served as a founding member of Lil' Band O' Gold, High Performance, the Racines, and The Band Courtbouillon—the latter earning him a Grammy Award in 2013 alongside Wayne Toups and Wilson Savoy.[1][4] The band continues to tour worldwide while maintaining strong ties to their roots in Acadiana, performing regularly at area festivals, nightclubs, and notably at Mamou the night before Mardi Gras.

Steve Riley's legacy extends to the next generation through his son Burke Riley, who began his musical journey at age 3 and by age 14 had become a multi-instrumentalist member of both the Mamou Playboys and Band Courtbouillon, playing drums, acoustic guitar, and accordion.[4] The band's commitment to preserving and revitalizing Cajun culture while bringing new vitality to traditional songs has earned them numerous accolades beyond their Grammy recognition, including multiple Grammy nominations spanning decades and international acclaim as ambassadors of Cajun music.

## Fun Facts
- Steve Riley is a cousin of noted Cajun musician and accordion builder Marc Savoy, connecting him to another prominent family in Cajun music.[3]
- Burke Riley, Steve's son, began performing onstage at just 3 years old sitting in with Band Courtbouillon and the Mamou Playboys on drums, and by age 6 had already picked up accordion and was tackling some of Cajun music's most complex melodies.[4]
- David Greely, the co-founder and fiddler of the Mamou Playboys, grew up near Baton Rouge remote from Cajun life but deliberately immersed himself in his grandparents' Cajun heritage and language, studying fiddle with Dewey Balfa and diving deep into the Archive of Cajun and Creole music to find forgotten songs to revive.[4]
- The band performs a traditional Mardi Gras dance in Mamou, Louisiana the night before Mardi Gras, maintaining their deep connection to their hometown roots despite their international touring schedule.[4]
