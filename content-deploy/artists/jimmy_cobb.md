## Biography
Wilbur James 'Jimmy' Cobb was born on January 20, 1929, in Washington, D.C., and became one of jazz's most influential yet understated drummers.[1][2] Largely self-taught, Cobb began playing drums in his mid-teens and quickly absorbed the bebop canon while working with local luminaries like saxophonist Charlie Rouse.[7] His early professional career included engagements with Billie Holiday, Earl Bostic, Dinah Washington, Pearl Bailey, Dizzy Gillespie, and Cannonball Adderley, which helped him develop a mature, adaptable style that balanced firepower with subtlety.[4][6] In May 1958, after Cannonball Adderley recommended him to Miles Davis, Cobb joined Davis's First Great Sextet, a decision that would define his legacy and cement his place in jazz history.[2][7]

Cobb's most celebrated work came during his tenure with Miles Davis from 1958 to 1962, during which he played on some of the most important jazz recordings ever made, including the landmark album 'Kind of Blue' (1959), as well as 'Sketches of Spain,' 'Someday My Prince Will Come,' and 'Porgy and Bess.'[1][6] His subtle and understated demeanor, which drew admiration from Davis himself, contrasted sharply with the more flamboyant styles of his contemporaries like Philly Joe Jones, Art Blakey, and Elvin Jones, embodying a 'less is more' approach to drumming.[2][7] After leaving Davis's group, Cobb formed the Wynton Kelly Trio with bassist Paul Chambers and pianist Wynton Kelly, touring and recording with artists including Wes Montgomery, J.J. Johnson, and Joe Henderson until Chambers's death in 1969.[8]

Despite his reluctance toward the spotlight and his eschewing of publicity, Cobb remained active as a performer and recording artist well into his later years, releasing his first album as bandleader in 1983 with 'So Nobody Else Can Hear,' followed by projects including 'Only For The Pure Of Heart' (1998), 'Cobb's Corner' (2007), 'The Original Mob' (2014), and 'This I Dig Of You' (2019).[2][5] He was honored with an NEA Jazz Masters Fellowship in 2009, recognizing his profound contributions to jazz.[2] Cobb passed away on May 24, 2020, at the age of 91, having been the last surviving player from the 'Kind of Blue' sessions for nearly three decades after Miles Davis's death in 1991.[2]

## Fun Facts
- Jimmy Cobb was the last surviving musician from the 'Kind of Blue' sessions for nearly three decades after Miles Davis's death in 1991, making him a living link to one of jazz's most important recordings.[2]
- Despite his crucial role in creating some of jazz's greatest recordings, Cobb's subtle and understated drumming style meant he did not receive the same level of recognition as his more flamboyant contemporaries like Art Blakey and Elvin Jones, and he was reluctant to pursue publicity or take on a bandleader role until 1983.[2][3]
- Cobb was largely self-taught, developing his skills by absorbing the bebop canon while working with local Washington, D.C. musicians before moving to New York at age 21.[6][7]
- After leaving Miles Davis's group in 1962, Cobb recorded 'Boss Guitar' with Wes Montgomery the very next day, demonstrating his continued demand as a session and touring musician.[8]
