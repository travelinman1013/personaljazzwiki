## Biography
Tommy Prine is an American singer-songwriter born in Nashville, Tennessee, and the youngest son of late songwriting legend John Prine. Growing up in a household where music was not merely a hobby but a lifestyle, Tommy was immersed in songwriting and performance from an early age. He learned guitar by watching his father play, inadvertently developing his own singular style through observation and imitation. His musical influences expanded through summers spent in Ireland and ten consecutive years camping at Bonnaroo, exposing him to an eclectic range of artists including John Mayer, Outkast, Bon Iver, and the Strokes. Despite this rich musical environment, Tommy didn't seriously pursue songwriting until his late teenage years, initially keeping his compositions private while attending Colorado State University briefly before returning to Nashville.

Tommy's path to professional music was shaped significantly by personal tragedy and loss. During his early twenties, he experienced a period of being lost, marked by substance abuse and dark moments, including the loss of friends to overdose and other circumstances. Following his father's death in April 2020—during the early days of the pandemic when Tommy was just 24 years old—songwriting became a therapeutic outlet for processing grief. This creative turning point led to the development of his debut album 'This Far South,' which explores existential questions, emotional experiences, and the journey from darkness to recovery. The album's title track marks a pivotal moment in his life when he chose to escape an aimless period and commit to a better path.

Known for his emotionally raw songwriting and spellbinding live performances, Tommy Prine has established himself as an artist carving out space beyond the shadow of his legendary father's legacy. His music is characterized by a powerful, deep voice reminiscent of Jason Isbell, sneaky-good guitar work featuring alternate tunings and unexpected picking patterns, and melodies that balance complexity with catchiness. Since releasing 'This Far South' in 2023, he has toured extensively, opened for notable artists like Tyler Childers and Todd Snider, and was named one of Amazon Music's 2023 Breakthrough Artists to Watch. His work continues to resonate with audiences, particularly those who have experienced loss, as he demonstrates the shared nature of grief and human suffering through his performances.

## Fun Facts
- As a child, Tommy thought all parents were musicians because his father's 'going to work' meant performing shows for adoring fans and writing songs.
- Tommy discovered his songwriting potential during an impromptu late-night guitar session with Ruston Kelly on Father's Day 2020 at his mother's house at 1 a.m., where he played an early version of what would become the title track 'This Far South.'
- When asked if he considered releasing his debut album on Oh Boy! Records—the label founded by his father John Prine in 1981—Tommy made it clear that was never going to happen, choosing instead to establish his own independent path.
- Tommy has reported being able to identify audience members who have lost their fathers during his performances, saying he can 'literally look out in the crowd and tell who else has lost their dad' based on their reactions to his grief-centered songs.
