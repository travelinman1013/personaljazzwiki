## Biography
Kinky Friedman, born Richard F. Friedman on October 31, 1944, in Chicago, Illinois, is an American singer-songwriter, novelist, and satirist best known for his sharp wit and irreverent take on country music. Raised in Texas from an early age, Friedman grew up on a ranch in the Texas Hill Country after his family relocated from Chicago. He attended the University of Texas at Austin, graduating in 1966, and subsequently served two years in the Peace Corps in Borneo and the South Pacific[2][5].

Friedman began his music career in the early 1970s, forming the band Kinky Friedman and The Texas Jewboys. His music, a blend of outlaw country, alt-country, and Americana, stood out for its satirical edge, social commentary, and willingness to tackle taboo subjects. Songs like "They Ain't Makin' Jews Like Jesus Anymore," "Get Your Biscuits in the Oven and Your Buns in the Bed," and "Ride 'Em Jewboy" (a tribute to Holocaust victims) exemplified his unique style—mixing humor, pathos, and pointed critique[3][5]. Despite limited commercial success, Friedman became a cult figure, touring with Bob Dylan’s Rolling Thunder Revue and performing on 'Saturday Night Live' in 1976[2][3][5].

After his music career slowed in the 1980s, Friedman reinvented himself as a novelist, penning detective stories featuring a fictionalized version of himself. He also became a columnist for Texas Monthly and ran for governor of Texas, further cementing his legacy as a Texas iconoclast and cultural provocateur. His influence on the outlaw country movement and Americana genre remains significant, and his work continues to inspire musicians and writers who value wit, independence, and social commentary[2][4][5].
