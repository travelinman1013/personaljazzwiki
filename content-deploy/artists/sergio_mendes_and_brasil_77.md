## Biography
Sérgio Mendes, born on February 11, 1941, in Niterói, Brazil, discovered his passion for music early despite health challenges like osteomyelitis that required a cast for three years; his father, a doctor, supported his talent by providing penicillin, one of the first in Brazil. Trained classically at Curso Santa Cecilia and the Conservatory of Music in Niterói from 1947–1955, Mendes was profoundly influenced by jazz giants like Dave Brubeck, Horace Silver, Art Tatum, Stan Getz, Dizzy Gillespie, and Charlie Byrd, shifting his focus to jazz and bossa nova. In the late 1950s, he led groups like the Bossa Rio Sextet, recording the landmark LP 'Você ainda não ouviu nada' with arrangements by Antonio Carlos Jobim and Moacyr Santos, gaining popularity across Brazil and touring internationally as an opening act for fashion shows.

Mendes moved to the United States in 1964 with Brasil '64, then innovated by adding female vocals in 1965 to form Brasil '66, signing with A&M Records through Herb Alpert and Jerry Moss; their debut hit 'Mas Que Nada' by Jorge Ben became the first Portuguese-language song to reach the US Billboard Top 5, blending bossa nova with pop and jazz for global success. In the early 1970s, he evolved the group into the larger, more instrumental Brasil '77, exploring fusions with soul, funk, and disco while maintaining bossa nova roots, as heard in albums like 'Primal Roots.' Mendes released over 35 albums, earned Grammy awards including for 'Brasileiro' in 1993 and 'Bom Tempo' in 2010, and co-wrote the Oscar-nominated 'Real in Rio' for the 2011 film 'Rio,' cementing his legacy as the most renowned Brazilian musician worldwide with a 60-year career of reinvention.[1][2][3][4][5]
