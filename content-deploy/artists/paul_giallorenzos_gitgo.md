## Biography
Paul Giallorenzo, born in the Bronx, New York City and raised on Long Island, began his musical journey listening to rock bands like Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, and The Allman Brothers before discovering jazz in high school through his band teacher, who introduced him to Miles Davis, followed by Thelonious Monk, Bill Evans, and Herbie Hancock's Headhunters era.[1] Largely self-taught, he moved to Chicago in 1995 to attend Northwestern University, earning a degree in comparative literary studies in 1999, and immersed himself in the city's experimental jazz scene, playing hybrid styles blending hip-hop, funk, and free jazz.[1][2] In 2001, he co-formed the band Hearts and Minds with childhood friend Jason Stein, whom he met in sixth grade in Rockville Centre, and helped establish Elastic Arts, a key venue for experimental music where he serves as co-founder, music programmer, and curator.[1][2]

Giallorenzo formed his quintet GitGo (short for 'Get In to Get Go') in 2004, exploring projects across duos, trios, and larger ensembles with instruments ranging from acoustic piano to synthesizers, organs, and electronics on labels like Delmark, Astral Spirits, and Vimeo.[1][2][3] His 2014 Delmark album 'Force Majeure' with GitGo garnered critical acclaim, highlighted by Mars Williams' driving saxophone, while later works like the 2018 trio album 'Play' (with Joshua Abrams and Mikel Patrick Avery) fuse pentatonic chords, modals, bop lines, and impressionistic elements akin to Debussy and Pharaoh Sanders.[1] His style bridges traditional jazz with avant-garde freedom, earning praise for 'inside-out' approaches that structure experimental material and push conventional boundaries.[2]

A fixture in Chicago's thriving jazz ecosystem—from AACM legacies to venues like Hungry Brain and Elastic Arts—Giallorenzo's quarter-century involvement includes leading GitGo quintets, acoustic piano trios, and electronic quartets, with recent projects like the 2020 'Red Sotol' duo with Ingebrigt Håker Flaten.[1][2] His multifaceted role as improviser, composer, producer, and sound designer continues to influence the local scene through performances, recordings, and curatorial work.[4]
