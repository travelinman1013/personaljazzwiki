## Biography
Etta James, born Jamesetta Hawkins on January 25, 1938, in Los Angeles, California, was a prodigious vocal talent whose career would span over five decades and encompass blues, soul, R&B, jazz, and gospel. Raised in a turbulent environment by her teenage mother and a succession of caregivers, James found stability and purpose in music, singing in the St. Paul Baptist Church choir under the guidance of renowned director James Earl Hines. By her early teens, she had moved to San Francisco, where she formed the girl group the Creolettes.

Her big break came in 1954 when bandleader Johnny Otis discovered her, renamed her Etta James, and helped launch her recording career with the hit "The Wallflower (Roll with Me, Henry)." James's powerful, emotionally charged voice quickly set her apart, and she soon embarked on a solo career, signing with Chess Records in 1960. There, she recorded enduring classics such as "At Last," "I'd Rather Go Blind," and "Something's Got a Hold on Me," blending blues, soul, jazz, and gospel influences into a singular style marked by raw emotion and technical brilliance. Despite personal struggles with addiction and tumultuous relationships, James continued to record and perform, earning multiple Grammy Awards and induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

James's legacy is profound: she is celebrated as one of the most influential vocalists in American music, bridging the worlds of blues and soul and inspiring generations of artists. Her ability to convey vulnerability and strength through her music, coupled with her resilience in the face of adversity, has cemented her status as a true icon.
