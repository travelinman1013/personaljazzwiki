## Biography
Wayne Toups was born on October 2, 1958, in Lafayette, Louisiana, and grew up in Crowley in the heart of Acadiana. He picked up the accordion at age 13 in 1971 and quickly began entertaining audiences in Southwest Louisiana venues, winning local accordion contests. By the mid-1970s, he had already released his first album, Wayne Toups and the Crowley Aces, in Europe. Toups gained significant popularity in the United States starting around 1984 when he began performing at major festivals like the Festivals Acadiens in Lafayette, establishing himself as a dynamic force in Louisiana music.

Toups is best known for creating and popularizing "Zydecajun," a revolutionary fusion genre that combines traditional Cajun music with the bluesier sounds of zydeco, soul music, and rock and roll elements. He introduced this style with a new band in 1987 and has since become one of the most commercially successful American Cajun singers. His electrifying stage presence, often featuring him in Hawaiian shirts and perpetual motion with his accordion, earned him the nickname "The Cajun Springsteen." He sings in both English and French, making his music accessible to diverse audiences.

Throughout his career, Toups has achieved numerous accolades and maintained a prolific recording and touring schedule. He has recorded for major labels including Mercury/Polygram and released influential albums such as Zydecajun (1986), Johnnie Can't Dance (1988), Blast from the Bayou (1989), Back to the Bayou (1995), and Little Wooden Box (2000). His 1995 album Back to the Bayou became the fastest-selling record ever for the independent Louisiana label Swallow Records. In 2013, he won a Grammy Award for Best Regional Roots Music Album for The Band Courtbouillon with Steve Riley and Wilson Savoy. Toups has been inducted into multiple halls of fame including the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame (2010), Gulf Coast Hall of Fame (2011), Cajun French Music Hall of Fame (2011), and Louisiana Blues Hall of Fame (2003). He has performed in over 26 countries and appeared at the 1990 Super Bowl, cementing his status as one of the most visible and commercially successful musicians of his genre.
