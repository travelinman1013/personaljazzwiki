## Biography
John Coltrane (September 23, 1926 – July 17, 1967) was an American jazz saxophonist, bandleader, and composer, widely regarded as one of the most influential and innovative musicians in jazz history. Born in Hamlet, North Carolina, and raised in High Point, Coltrane was exposed to music early through his family and began playing clarinet and later saxophone during his youth. After graduating high school, he moved to Philadelphia in 1943 to pursue music studies and soon made his professional debut, performing with local bands and eventually joining the U.S. Navy band during World War II.[1][2][3][5]

Coltrane's career developed rapidly in the postwar years as he played with jazz luminaries such as Dizzy Gillespie, Earl Bostic, and Johnny Hodges. His major breakthrough came as a member of Miles Davis's quintet in the mid-1950s, where he contributed to the development of modal jazz, notably on the landmark album 'Kind of Blue.' After overcoming struggles with addiction, Coltrane embarked on a prolific solo career, recording seminal albums such as 'Giant Steps,' 'My Favorite Things,' and the spiritually charged 'A Love Supreme.' His work pushed the boundaries of jazz, incorporating complex harmonies, modal improvisation, and later, the avant-garde elements of free jazz.[1][2][4][6]

Coltrane's legacy extends far beyond his lifetime; he led at least fifty recording sessions and collaborated with many of the era's greatest musicians. His relentless pursuit of innovation and spiritual expression in music has inspired generations of artists across genres. Posthumously, he has received numerous honors, including a special Pulitzer Prize, and remains a towering figure in both jazz and 20th-century music.[2][3]

## Fun Facts
- Coltrane's rapid-fire improvisational style was dubbed 'sheets of sound' by critics, reflecting his ability to play dense, cascading runs of notes.[3]
- He was posthumously canonized as a saint by the African Orthodox Church, a rare honor for a jazz musician.[2]
- Coltrane's soprano saxophone rendition of 'My Favorite Things' became a commercial hit and a jazz standard, despite being a reimagining of a Broadway tune.[6]
- He overcame a serious heroin addiction in the late 1950s, which he credited with sparking a spiritual awakening that deeply influenced his later music.[1][4]
