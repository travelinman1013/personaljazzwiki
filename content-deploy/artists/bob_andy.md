## Biography
Bob Andy, born Keith Anderson on October 28, 1944, in Kingston, Jamaica, emerged as one of reggae's most influential and prolific songwriters. His early life was marked by hardship: after moving to Westmoreland to live with his grandmother at age seven, he was later given away by his mother and suffered abuse at the hands of his adoptive parents. Eventually, he became a ward of the state at Maxfield Park children's home, where he taught himself piano and began singing in the Kingston Parish Church choir[2][3].

Andy’s musical journey began in the 1960s as a founding member of The Paragons, alongside Tyrone Evans and Howard Barrett, with John Holt joining later. After leaving the group, he became closely associated with Studio One, Jamaica’s premier recording studio, where he worked as a songwriter and delivered records. His solo career flourished with hits like "I've Got to Go Back Home" (1967), "Desperate Lover," "Feeling Soul," and "Too Experienced." Andy also wrote songs for other reggae luminaries, including Ken Boothe and Marcia Griffiths. In the early 1970s, he teamed up with Griffiths as Bob and Marcia, achieving international success with their UK hit "Young, Gifted and Black" and touring with artists such as Elton John[1][2][3].

Bob Andy’s poetic lyrics and soulful delivery helped define the sound of rocksteady and roots reggae, and his compositions have become standards, covered by generations of artists. He was a pioneering force not only as a performer but also as a songwriter and publisher, establishing his own company, Andisongs. Andy’s legacy endures through his timeless catalog and his profound influence on reggae music worldwide[1][2][5].
