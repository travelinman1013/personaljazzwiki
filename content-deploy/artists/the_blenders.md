## Biography
The Blenders are a vocal quartet originally from Fargo, North Dakota, consisting of Tim Kasper, Ryan Lance, Darren Rust, and Allan Rust (who replaced original member Paul Dunkirk). Formed in the early 1990s, the group built their reputation through a primarily a cappella singing style, touring hundreds of colleges and universities across the U.S. and earning the Contemporary Artist of the Year award from the National Association for Campus Activities in 1994 and 1995. Each member grew up in musical families, drawing influences from R&B, Jazz, Pop, and Rock to create tight vocal harmonies and upbeat arrangements[1][3].

In 1997, they signed with Universal Records and released their major-label debut 'Loveland,' which achieved mild U.S. radio success and topped charts in several European countries with a remake of Dean Friedman's '(I Am in Love With the) McDonald's Girl.' The group relocated to Minneapolis, Minnesota, in 1994 and became renowned for their Christmas albums, releasing nine holiday records including 'Nog' (1997), 'When It Snows' (2002), and 'Holy Night' (2017), alongside a total of 14-15 albums. They toured extensively, including their long-running Holiday Soul Tour for 26 years, and shared stages with artists like Jay Leno, Chicago, and Chuck Berry[1][3].

In 2019, a documentary 'One Last Song' chronicled their 30-year career, produced by Forum Communications. The group was inducted into the North Dakota Music Hall of Fame recently and the Minnesota Music Hall of Fame in 2015. After 35 years together, they announced in 2025 that they would step away from touring to reset and explore new options, while continuing to focus on vocal harmony-based music[1][3].
