## Biography
Rich Willey is an accomplished American jazz trumpeter, composer, arranger, educator, and bandleader, born in Florida and currently based in North Carolina. His musical journey began with formal studies at the U.S. Navy School of Music and North Texas State University, followed by intensive gigging in Philadelphia and Atlantic City before settling in northern New Jersey, where he immersed himself in the vibrant New York jazz scene. Willey furthered his education with a bachelor's degree from the University of South Florida and a master's in jazz performance from the Manhattan School of Music, studying with renowned mentors such as Byron Stripling and Mike Abene.

Willey's career is marked by versatility and depth, performing with legendary artists including Maynard Ferguson, Lionel Hampton, Mel Tormé, Hank Mobley, and many others. He played the demanding jazz trumpet chair on tour with Ferguson's Big Bop Nouveau and spent several years touring with the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra under Buddy Morrow. Willey is also a prolific composer and author, founding Boptism Music in 2001 to publish his extensive catalog of jazz books, arrangements, and original compositions. His musical style draws deeply from the bebop tradition, blending brash, forceful trumpet lines with lyrical warmth, and his arrangements are noted for their melodic accessibility and sophisticated swing.

As an educator, Willey has taught at institutions such as UNC-Asheville, Clemson University, Limestone College, and Gardner-Webb University, influencing a new generation of jazz musicians. His legacy includes not only his recordings and performances but also his contributions to jazz pedagogy and publishing, making him a respected figure in both performance and education circles.
