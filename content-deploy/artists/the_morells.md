## Biography
The Morells are a roots rock band originating from Springfield, Missouri, whose lineage traces back to the bar band scene of the early 1970s. Emerging from the group The Symptoms, which evolved into The Skeletons, The Morells formed in the late 1970s and quickly became known for their energetic blend of rockabilly, R&B, rock-punk, soul, and country influences. Their debut album, 'Shake and Push,' was released in 1982, showcasing their eclectic musical style and playful spirit.

Throughout the 1980s and into the 2000s, The Morells maintained a reputation as journeyman musicians, revered for their live performances and deep knowledge of American roots music. While their discography is relatively sparse—with only a handful of albums released over several decades—the band’s members were highly active in the Springfield music scene and beyond, often collaborating with other artists and projects, particularly under the name The Skeletons. Their music is characterized by a joyful, unpretentious approach that celebrates classic American genres while injecting a sense of fun and irreverence.

Despite limited commercial output, The Morells have left a lasting legacy in the Midwest and among roots music aficionados. Their influence is felt in the way they bridged genres and eras, and their enduring presence is commemorated by a mural in downtown Springfield, symbolizing their importance to the local cultural landscape.
