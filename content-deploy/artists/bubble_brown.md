## Biography
Bubbles Brown is a one-man blues band, singer-songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist originally from Florida, now based in New Orleans, Louisiana. Brown's musical journey began in earnest in 2007 when he sold all his possessions for a plane ticket to Chicago, where he immersed himself in the city's vibrant blues and folk scenes, busking in subways and on the streets for over a decade. His raw, gritty sound is deeply rooted in the traditions of Mississippi hill country trance, bottleneck slide guitar, hot jazz, R&B, gospel, soul, country, and Appalachian clawhammer banjo, creating a unique blend that is both nostalgic and progressive.

During his years in Chicago, Brown met percussionist Washboard Ben Brundage after opening for Ben's country band at a house show. The two quickly became close collaborators, performing and recording together for ten years and independently releasing two records. Their partnership earned them local and national recognition, including opening slots for major acts like The Doors with Robby Krieger. In 2021, Brown left Chicago to tour solo, eventually settling in New Orleans, where he is now a resident musician, regularly performing on Frenchmen Street and continuing to tour nationwide.

Bubbles Brown is celebrated for his well-traveled, home-spun aesthetic and his ability to synthesize a wide array of American roots music influences into a compelling and modern sound. His performances are known for their lean, archaic setups and electrifying energy, earning him a devoted following and a respected place in the contemporary blues and roots music community.
