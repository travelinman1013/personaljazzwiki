## Biography
Nicole Atkins is an American singer-songwriter known for her evocative blend of pop soul, psychedelic rock, and 'pop noir.' Born on October 1, 1978, in Neptune City, New Jersey, Atkins began playing piano at age nine and taught herself guitar by thirteen[1][2][3]. After high school, she studied illustration at UNC Charlotte, but quickly became involved in the local independent music scene[5]. Her early exposure to classic soul, blues, and rock shaped her distinctive style, which draws comparisons to artists like Roy Orbison, Stevie Nicks, and Nick Cave[2][3].

Atkins moved back to New Jersey and started commuting to New York City to immerse herself in its vibrant music community. In 2004, she recorded her demo 'The Party’s Over' with drummer David Muller, which led to the formation of her band Nicole Atkins & The Sea[1][2]. The group secured a residency at Piano’s in NYC and attracted attention from major labels, resulting in a bidding war won by Columbia Records. Her debut album, 'Neptune City,' was recorded in Sweden with producer Tore Johansson and released in 2007 to critical acclaim, debuting at number 20 on Billboard’s Top Heatseekers chart[1][2][3]. After her band The Sea disbanded in 2009, Atkins formed The Black Sea and shifted her sound further towards psychedelic rock and blues, culminating in the well-received album 'Mondo Amore' (2011)[1][2]. Subsequent albums like 'Rhonda Lee' and 'Italian Ice' showcased her versatility and deepened her legacy as a genre-blending artist[3].

Atkins eventually relocated to Nashville to join a more collaborative and supportive music community, where she continued to evolve her sound and work with a wide range of musicians[4]. Her smoky, expressive vocals and cinematic songwriting have earned her a devoted following and respect among peers. She is recognized for her ability to transport listeners to different emotional landscapes, making her a unique figure in contemporary American music[6].
