## Biography
People Museum is a pop art and electronic band formed in 2016 by Jeremy Phipps and Claire Givens in the Treme neighborhood of New Orleans, Louisiana. Both Louisiana natives, Phipps (producer/trombonist) and Givens (composer/singer) sought to create a sound that blends the rich musical traditions of New Orleans with modern electronic and pop influences. Their music is characterized by lush synth textures, soulful vocals, and a DIY ethos, with the group being deeply involved in all aspects of their production and artistic direction.

The band expanded to include Aaron Boudreaux and Charles Lumar II, further enriching their sonic palette. People Museum's work is often described as innovative, merging dream pop and electronic elements with the cultural vibrancy of New Orleans. Their debut album, 'I Dreamt You in Technicolor,' showcases their unique approach, drawing comparisons to artists like Brian Eno and the atmospheric qualities of Twin Peaks, while still maintaining a distinct New Orleans flavor. The group is known for their hands-on approach, producing, composing, and performing their music independently, which has garnered them a dedicated local following and critical acclaim within the New Orleans arts community.

People Museum's legacy is rooted in their ability to bridge the gap between traditional and contemporary sounds, making them a standout act in the New Orleans music scene. Their commitment to artistic experimentation and community engagement continues to influence emerging musicians in the region.
