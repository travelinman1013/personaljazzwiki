The most prominent figure is Gianluca Zanna, an Italian-born, US-based songwriter and music producer born and raised in Rome, Italy. Sent to boarding school at age 10, Gianluca discovered music as an escape from the structured environment, teaching himself guitar, bass, and drums after discovering forgotten instruments in the school's attic. His early influences included Giorgio Moroder and Jean-Michel Jarre, and he was significantly shaped by producer Brian Reeves, known for work with Donna Summer, U2, and Billy Idol. Gianluca founded Zanna Records, his own label through which he has released over 120 original compositions, establishing himself as a versatile artist working across pop, rock, EDM, and dance genres. Beyond music, he is also a successful entrepreneur, bodyguard, Krav-Maga practitioner, and firearms instructor. Separately, there is a female singer-songwriter named Zanna from southern California (born in San Diego, raised in Orange County) who works in folk, jazz, rock, and world music genres, pulling from her classical piano training that began in childhood.
