## Biography
Sungha Jung (정성하; born September 2, 1996, in Cheongju, North Chungcheong, South Korea) is a renowned South Korean acoustic fingerstyle guitarist who rose to international fame through his YouTube channel, where he began uploading guitar covers and original compositions as a child prodigy. Inspired initially by watching his father play guitar, Jung transitioned from piano to guitar at a young age, quickly developing a unique fingerstyle technique that allows him to simultaneously play melody, harmony, and percussion on a single instrument. His early influences included Japanese guitarist Kotaro Oshio and German fingerstyle virtuoso Ulli Bögershausen, who would later become a mentor.

Jung's career accelerated rapidly after his YouTube videos, particularly his cover of the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' theme, went viral, earning him millions of followers and widespread acclaim. He has since released several albums, including his debut 'Perfect Blue' and its follow-up 'Irony,' and has collaborated with prominent artists such as Narsha, 2NE1, G-Dragon, and Jason Mraz. Jung is known for his meticulous arrangements, often learning songs by ear or from videos, and for his ability to blend genres from pop and k-ballad to soundtrack music. Despite being dubbed a 'guitar prodigy' and 'August Rush' in Korea, he prefers to be recognized simply as a guitarist.

Jung's legacy lies in his role as a bridge between classical fingerstyle traditions and contemporary pop culture, inspiring a new generation of guitarists worldwide. His dedication to his craft, innovative arrangements, and approachable online presence have made him a leading figure in modern acoustic guitar music.
