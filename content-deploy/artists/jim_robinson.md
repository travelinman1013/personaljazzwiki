## Biography
Jim Robinson, born Nathan Robinson on December 25, 1890, in Deer Range, Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, was a seminal figure in New Orleans jazz, renowned for his robust 'tailgate' trombone style. Initially trained on guitar by the influential Professor James Brown Humphrey, Robinson only turned to the trombone in his mid-twenties while serving in the US Army during World War I. After the 1915 hurricane destroyed his hometown, he settled permanently in New Orleans, where he balanced work as a longshoreman with an increasingly prominent musical career.

Robinson's breakthrough came in the 1920s when he joined the Sam Morgan Jazz Band, contributing to their influential Columbia recordings. Throughout the 1930s and 1940s, he became a fixture in the New Orleans jazz scene, playing with Kid Rena, Kid Howard, and most notably, Bunk Johnson and George Lewis, with whom he recorded extensively and toured internationally. His deep, wide-toned sound and mastery of glissando made him a favorite at Preservation Hall, where he performed with legends like 'Sweet' Emma Barrett and Percy Humphrey. Robinson's legacy is marked by his consistency, reliability, and the profound influence he had on generations of trombonists in both the United States and Europe.

Robinson's signature tune, 'Ice Cream,' became a staple of his performances, and he was known for encouraging audience participation and dancing. He recorded as a bandleader for labels such as Atlantic, Pearl, and Riverside, and remained active until shortly before his death from cancer in New Orleans on May 4, 1976.
