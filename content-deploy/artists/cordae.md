## Biography
Cordae Amari Dunston was born on August 26, 1997, in Raleigh, North Carolina, to a teenage single mother in circumstances that would shape his perspective on life and art.[2][5] His family relocated multiple times during his childhood, moving from Zebulon, North Carolina to Suitland, Maryland when he was nine years old, and later to Waldorf, Maryland. This constant relocation forced him to attend seven different elementary schools, an experience that he credits with developing his adaptability.[3] Growing up in the DMV (Washington D.C. metropolitan area), Cordae was exposed to hip-hop's golden era through his father's collection of classic artists including Rakim, Nas, Talib Kweli, Jay-Z, Dr. Dre, and Mos Def.[1][3] His mother, a literature enthusiast, introduced him to foundational Black writers like W.E.B. Du Bois, whose work influenced his lyrical thinking and worldview.[4] He began writing raps at age 10 and became increasingly serious about his craft as a teenager, using YouTube's recommendation algorithm as his primary source for studying hip-hop history and technique.[1][2]

After graduating high school in 2015 with strong academic credentials (AP honors classes, mostly A's and B's), Cordae enrolled at Towson University in Maryland to study mass communications, driven by the desire to be the first in his family to earn a college degree.[2][3] However, the college experience proved overwhelming, and he struggled to balance academics with his passion for music while working jobs at TGI Fridays and Texas Roadhouse.[2] In 2018, recognizing that college was "bigger than him" and that his true calling lay in music, he made the pivotal decision to drop out and pursue rap full-time.[1][3] The turning point came when he connected with YBN Nahmir and YBN Almighty Jay through social media in Los Angeles, leading him to officially change his stage name from Entendre to YBN Cordae and join the YBN collective.[1] His breakthrough came through viral remixes of songs like Eminem's "My Name Is" and J. Cole's "1985," which showcased his sharp lyrical commentary and deep respect for hip-hop's roots, ultimately establishing him as one of the modern generation's most trusted narrators in the genre.[6]

Cordae's musical style is characterized by introspective lyricism, clever wordplay, and a bridge between generational gaps in hip-hop, combining the conscious rap tradition of his influences with contemporary production sensibilities.[6] His debut album earned Grammy nominations, and he has become a two-time Grammy Award-nominated, gold-selling artist who represents a new generation of thoughtful, lyrically-focused rappers.[9] His journey from a working-class background through college struggles to mainstream success embodies the resilience and determination that permeates his music, making him a voice for his generation's experiences navigating education, economic mobility, and artistic ambition.

## Fun Facts
- Cordae changed elementary schools seven times during his childhood due to his family's frequent relocations for work, which he credits with making him adaptable and resilient.[3]
- At age 10, Cordae was already rapping about money, cars, clothes, and girls—admittedly "straight lying"—and his mother noted he was obsessed with money at that young age.[5]
- Before his music career took off, Cordae worked at TGI Fridays and Texas Roadhouse, jobs he hated and knew were not his destiny, telling Adam 22 of No Jumper that he always knew he "was meant to do something bigger."[3]
- Cordae gained initial recognition through viral remixes of established songs like Eminem's "My Name Is" and J. Cole's "1985," which showcased his ability to pay homage to hip-hop legends while establishing his own voice.[6]
