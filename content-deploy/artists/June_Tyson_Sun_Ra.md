## Biography
June Tyson (February 5, 1936 – November 24, 1992) was an American singer, violinist, dancer, and choreographer, best known for her pivotal role in Sun Ra’s Arkestra. Born in Albemarle, North Carolina, Tyson moved to Harlem, New York, where she performed in nightclubs and outdoor musicals during the 1960s. Her talents as both a vocalist and performer caught the attention of the Arkestra’s manager, who introduced her to Sun Ra in 1968. Tyson quickly became the only woman in the Arkestra, contributing not just as a singer but also as a violinist, costume designer, and choreographer.

Tyson’s musical style was deeply intertwined with Sun Ra’s vision of Afrofuturism, blending free jazz, cosmic poetry, and theatrical performance. She became the voice of many of the Arkestra’s most iconic pieces, such as 'Space is the Place' and 'Enlightenment,' and was known for her powerful stage presence and ability to interpret Sun Ra’s complex cosmology through music and movement. Beyond the stage, Tyson was a caretaker for the Arkestra, often hosting rehearsals and providing a home base for band members in Harlem.

Her legacy endures as a trailblazer for women in avant-garde jazz and as a key architect of the Arkestra’s sound and visual identity. Tyson’s 25-year tenure with Sun Ra helped shape the group’s legendary performances and left an indelible mark on the world of free jazz and Afrofuturism.
