## Biography
The Red Devils were a Los Angeles-based blues rock band that blazed a brief but legendary trail through the early 1990s blues scene. The band's origins trace back to 1988 when drummer Bill Bateman, formerly of roots-punk group The Blasters, grew tired of that band's inactivity and assembled a loose collective of blues musicians. Initially performing under names like The Stumblebums and Blue Shadows, the group coalesced around frontman and harmonica virtuoso Lester Butler, who had been playing music since age six and drew inspiration from blues legends like Howlin' Wolf and Muddy Waters, as well as rock icons like CCR, Aerosmith, and Jimi Hendrix. The band's raw, energetic approach to blues attracted the attention of legendary producer Rick Rubin, who saw them perform upwards of 60 times at their Monday night residency at the King King club in Los Angeles before signing them to his Def American label in early 1991.

Rubin's deal came with two conditions: the band needed to adopt a more commercial name and find a permanent lead guitarist. The Bartel brothers—Dave Lee and Jonny Ray—revived the name "Red Devils" from a high school rockabilly band they had played in, and through the blues grapevine, they recruited 19-year-old guitar prodigy Paul Size from Denton, Texas. This lineup recorded their sole studio album, "King King," released in July 1992, which was captured live over three consecutive Mondays at the King King club and featured pianist Gene 'Fingers' Taylor. The album showcased their blistering interpretations of blues staples like Willie Dixon's "She's Dangerous" and Chester Burnett's "Mr Highway Man" alongside original compositions, with Size's incendiary guitar work complementing Butler's powerful harmonica playing and impassioned vocals. Despite critical acclaim and support from industry heavyweights like Mick Jagger, Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top, and Johnny Cash, the band's career was plagued by internal tensions, drug abuse, and financial troubles.

The Red Devils reached their peak with an electrifying performance at the Pink Pop festival in Holland in 1993, but the band quickly unraveled afterward. Paul Size quit and returned to Texas, exhausted from two years of sharing an apartment with Butler and the band's chaotic lifestyle. The remaining members recorded one final session backing Johnny Cash at Ocean Way studios for Rick Rubin before being dropped from Def American. They limped through a final European tour in 1994 before dissolving amid accusations of financial mismanagement and drug-fueled betrayals. Butler continued performing until his untimely death in 1998. Though active for only six years and releasing just one album, The Red Devils left an indelible mark on the early '90s blues scene, representing what many consider the greatest American blues band of that era—a group whose explosive live performances and authentic approach to the blues stood defiantly against the grunge and metal dominating the musical landscape of the time.

## Fun Facts
- Rick Rubin was so obsessed with The Red Devils that he saw them perform over 60 times at their Monday night residency at the King King club in Los Angeles before signing them to his label, and he insisted on recording their album live rather than in a traditional studio setting to capture their raw energy.
- The band's name "Red Devils" was recycled from a high school rockabilly band that the Bartel brothers had played in as teenagers. When Rick Rubin saw an old button badge from that band, he told them to revive the name because it would sell more records than their current name, Blue Shadows.
- Despite only releasing one album, The Red Devils attracted an impressive roster of famous fans who would join them onstage or attend their shows, including Mick Jagger, Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top, and Johnny Cash, whom they backed in what would be their final recording session for Rick Rubin.
- The band's breakup was as chaotic as their career—guitarist Paul Size fled back to Texas after becoming exhausted from sharing an apartment with Lester Butler for two years, and band members later accused Butler of stealing money from the group, with one member stating 'It was strictly his greed that took us out—that and drugs.'
