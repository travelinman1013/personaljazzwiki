## Biography
Oscar Peterson & The Singers Unlimited is not a permanent band but a celebrated collaboration between the legendary Canadian jazz pianist Oscar Peterson and the innovative American vocal group The Singers Unlimited. Oscar Peterson, born in Montreal in 1925, was renowned for his extraordinary piano technique and expressive jazz interpretations, rising to international prominence in the 1950s and 60s. By the early 1970s, Peterson was leading a trio with bassist George Mraz and drummer Louis Hayes, continuing his tradition of virtuosic ensemble playing.

The Singers Unlimited, formed in Chicago in 1971 by Gene Puerling, began as a studio group specializing in commercial jingles before evolving into a pioneering vocal jazz quartet. The group comprised Gene Puerling (baritone and arranger), Bonnie Herman (lead soprano), Don Shelton (tenor), and Len Dresslar (bass). Their sophisticated harmonies and innovative use of multi-tracking technology set new standards in vocal jazz. On Peterson’s recommendation, The Singers Unlimited signed with MPS Records in Germany, leading to their first major album collaboration, 'In Tune' (1971), which showcased the seamless blend of Peterson's trio and the group's lush vocal arrangements.

Their collaboration is celebrated for its technical brilliance and musical synergy, influencing generations of jazz musicians and vocal groups. The 'In Tune' album remains a landmark in vocal jazz, exemplifying the creative possibilities when master instrumentalists and vocal innovators unite.
