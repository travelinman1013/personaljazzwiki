## Biography
Tom Misch & Laura Misch are a pair of South London–born sibling musicians whose work interweaves jazz, soul, hip‑hop and electronic textures into a distinctive, melodic sound. Tom (full name Thomas Abraham Misch, born 25 June 1995) is a guitarist, producer, singer‑songwriter and beatmaker who first gained attention in his late teens by uploading laid‑back, Dilla‑influenced instrumentals and songs to SoundCloud from his bedroom studio in the family home near Peckham.[2][6][7] He built a devoted online following and released early projects like his ‘Beat Tape’ series, gradually moving from loop‑based hip‑hop into a more song‑oriented fusion of jazz harmony, neo‑soul, and pop. Laura (born November 1992 in South London) is a saxophonist, singer‑songwriter, producer and field recordist whose work sits at the forefront of a new wave of UK jazz, blending live saxophone, voice and electronics into immersive, atmospheric compositions.[3][4][5] Raised in an artistic household with an artist mother and creative siblings, both grew up in a bohemian environment that encouraged experimentation and collaboration, and Laura would eventually contribute saxophone parts to Tom’s recordings.[2][5]

Over the 2010s, Tom developed from a bedroom producer into a touring artist, releasing EPs, collaborations and his debut album while cultivating a community of South London collaborators around his Beyond The Groove label and projects such as ‘Beat Tape 2’, which featured a roll call of local talent including rapper Loyle Carner, vocalists like Carmody and Jordan Rakei, and other members of the city’s burgeoning jazz‑soul scene.[2] His style is marked by warm guitar lines, jazz‑inflected chords and relaxed grooves reminiscent of J Dilla and Flying Lotus, paired with a melodic sensibility that crosses indie soul, jazz, and pop.[2][7] Laura, meanwhile, carved out her own path with solo releases and, later, her debut album ‘Sample The Sky’, a project inspired by the sky, reclaimed natural spaces in London and field recordings, using pop song structures while retaining a strong jazz and ambient sensibility.[1][3] Known as much for her saxophone tone as for her production and sound‑design work, she has become part of the new generation of UK jazz artists who blur genre boundaries. Together and separately, the Misch siblings embody a strand of contemporary London music that fuses jazz, electronic production and songcraft, and their work has helped strengthen the connective tissue between the city’s jazz, soul, and beat‑making communities.[2][3][4]

Although still early in their careers, both artists have already left a notable legacy in modern indie soul and jazz‑adjacent music. Tom’s DIY rise via SoundCloud, his J Dilla‑steeped beat tapes, and his collaborative South London network have influenced younger producer‑instrumentalists looking to bridge beat culture with live musicianship.[2][6][7] Laura’s hybrid practice as saxophonist, producer and field recordist has likewise become a touchstone for artists who want to integrate acoustic instruments, environmental sound and electronics into cohesive song‑led projects.[1][3][4] Their shared background and occasional collaborations underscore how familial and community ties continue to shape the evolving sound of London’s jazz and soul underground.

## Fun Facts
- Tom Misch grew up in a strongly artistic, bohemian household: his mother Carol is a visual artist who has designed some of his artwork, one sister Polly is an actor, and his other sister Laura is a musician who plays saxophone on his records.[2]
- Tom initially treated making music as a kind of social‑media habit, uploading a beat a day to SoundCloud and becoming hooked on the instant feedback and growing online community around his tracks.[2]
- Laura Misch is not only a saxophonist and singer but also an electronic producer and field recordist, and her debut album ‘Sample The Sky’ was inspired by the sky and parts of London where nature has reclaimed urban spaces, incorporating environmental sounds into its sonic palette.[1][3]
- Laura is often described as being at the forefront of a new generation of London jazz artists, due to her integration of live saxophone, vocals and electronics in a way that blurs jazz, ambient and pop song structures.[3][4]
