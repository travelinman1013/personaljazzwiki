## Biography
Michael Joseph Jackson was born on August 29, 1958, in Gary, Indiana, as the eighth child of the Jackson family. He began performing publicly at age six as the lead singer of the Jackson 5, a Motown act that became one of the most successful groups of the era. Jackson's early exposure to music and performance, combined with his family's musical background, set the stage for his future as an entertainer[1][2].

Jackson's solo career took off with the release of 'Off the Wall' in 1979, which showcased his ability to blend pop, funk, and disco. His next album, 'Thriller' (1982), became the best-selling album in history, breaking racial barriers and revolutionizing music videos with iconic short films for 'Thriller,' 'Beat It,' and 'Billie Jean.' Jackson continued to innovate with albums like 'Bad,' 'Dangerous,' and 'HIStory,' each exploring new musical styles and social themes. His stage presence, dance moves (including the moonwalk), and fashion influenced generations of artists and defined the visual language of pop music[1][2][5].

Widely known as the 'King of Pop,' Jackson's legacy includes 13 Grammy Awards, two inductions into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, and a profound impact on popular culture. He broke racial barriers on radio and MTV, popularized street dance, and set new standards for live performance and music production. Despite controversies and personal struggles later in life, Jackson remains one of the most influential and best-selling artists in history, with a legacy that continues to shape music and entertainment[1][2].
