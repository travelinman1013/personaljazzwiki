## Biography
Reverend Horton Heat is both the stage name of singer-songwriter Jim Heath and the name of his three-piece psychobilly band from Dallas, Texas. Born in 1959 in Corpus Christi, Texas, Jim Heath began his musical journey playing in a cover band called Southern Comfort before attending the University of Texas at Austin. His exposure to the punk scene in Austin and acts like The Cramps significantly influenced his style. The Reverend Horton Heat band formed in 1985, initially playing in Dallas's Deep Ellum neighborhood. Known for their 'Country-fed punkabilly' sound, they blend country, punk, big band, swing, and rockabilly, often with humorous lyrics. Through relentless touring, they have built a devoted fan base across America. Their breakthrough came with albums like 'Smoke 'Em If You Got 'Em' on Sub Pop Records and later success with Interscope Records, particularly with 'It's Martini Time' in 1996. The band's energetic live performances have been a hallmark of their career, making them one of the most popular underground acts in the U.S. Over the years, the band has expanded its lineup, incorporating new members like Arjuna 'RJ' Contreras and Matt Jordan, while maintaining their psychobilly roots. Reverend Horton Heat is often referred to as the 'Godfather of Modern Rockabilly' due to their significant influence on the genre. Their music has transcended generations, inspiring numerous psychobilly bands and maintaining a strong cult following. The band continues to innovate and perform, with annual residencies at venues like the Continental Club in Austin, Texas, showcasing their enduring legacy in rockabilly and psychobilly music.
