## Biography
Zoë Isabella Kravitz, born December 1, 1988 in Los Angeles, California, is an American actress, singer, and director known for her eclectic career across film, television, and music. The daughter of musician Lenny Kravitz and actress Lisa Bonet, Zoë was exposed to the arts from a young age, growing up in a creative environment that fostered her talents. She attended the State University of New York at Purchase to study acting but left after a year to pursue her career full-time, soon landing her first film role in 'No Reservations' (2007) while still in high school.

Kravitz's acting breakthrough came with her role as Angel Salvadore in 'X-Men: First Class' (2011), followed by prominent parts in major franchises such as 'Divergent' (2014–2016), 'Mad Max: Fury Road' (2015), 'Fantastic Beasts' (2016–2018), and 'The Batman' (2022). She also starred in acclaimed television series like 'Big Little Lies' and led the Hulu adaptation of 'High Fidelity,' where she served as executive producer. Alongside her acting, Kravitz has cultivated a music career, fronting the bands Elevator Fight and Lolawolf—the latter releasing the album 'Calm Down' in 2014 and touring with artists like Miley Cyrus and Lily Allen.

Musically, Kravitz is recognized for blending electronic R&B with indie and alternative influences, reflecting her diverse artistic background. She is credited as a co-writer on Taylor Swift's tracks 'Karma' and 'Lavender Haze.' In 2024, Kravitz made her directorial debut with the psychological thriller 'Blink Twice,' further establishing her as a multifaceted creative force. Her legacy is marked by her versatility, boundary-pushing roles, and influence as a style and cultural icon.
