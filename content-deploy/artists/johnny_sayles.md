## Biography
John Earl Sayles, Jr., known professionally as Johnny Sayles, was born on February 9, 1937, in Winnsboro, Texas. An American R&B and soul singer, Sayles began his musical journey early, relocating to St. Louis by age 18 to work with Eugene Neal's Rocking Kings, marking the start of his career in the vibrant R&B scene.[1][2][3][4]

Sayles developed his style within the R&B and soul genres, later becoming associated with northern soul through his energetic performances and recordings. He spent significant time in Chicago, Illinois, where he continued his work until his death on August 17, 1993, from a heart attack. His career spanned the mid-20th century soul era, contributing to the rich tapestry of American soul music.[1][3][4]

Though not a mainstream superstar, Sayles left a niche legacy in R&B and northern soul circles, with his music gaining cult appreciation among enthusiasts. His move from Texas to urban centers like St. Louis and Chicago exemplified the migration patterns of many soul artists seeking opportunities in larger music hubs.[2][3]
