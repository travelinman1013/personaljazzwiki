## Biography
The Preservation Hall Jazz Band is a legendary ensemble founded in 1961 in New Orleans, Louisiana, as part of the mission to preserve and promote traditional New Orleans jazz. The band originated from informal jam sessions at an art gallery run by Larry Borenstein in the French Quarter, where aging jazz musicians—many of whom had direct ties to the early inventors of jazz—gathered to play for tips. Allan and Sandra Jaffe, enchanted by these performances, took over the running of the venue and formalized it as Preservation Hall, creating a unique space for racially integrated bands and audiences during the Jim Crow era. 

Under the Jaffes' leadership, the Preservation Hall Jazz Band began touring in 1963, bringing the authentic sounds of New Orleans jazz to audiences worldwide. The band became a living repository of jazz tradition, with early members such as Sweet Emma Barrett, Billie and De De Pierce, Willie and Percy Humphrey, and Kid Thomas Valentine, many of whom had performed with jazz pioneers like Buddy Bolden, Jelly Roll Morton, and Louis Armstrong. Over the decades, the band has continued to evolve, integrating younger musicians through an informal apprenticeship system and collaborating with artists from a wide range of genres, all while maintaining its core mission. Today, under the direction of Ben Jaffe, son of the founders, the band remains a vital force in jazz, celebrated for its joyful performances and commitment to cultural preservation.
