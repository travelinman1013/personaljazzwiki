## Biography
Skeets McDonald, born Enos William McDonald on October 1, 1915, in Greenway, Arkansas, was a prominent American country and rockabilly musician whose career flourished in the 1950s and 1960s. Growing up as the youngest of seven children in a cotton-picking family, he earned his nickname 'Skeets' from his childhood mispronunciation of 'mosquitoes.' In the early 1930s, he followed his brother to Detroit, Michigan, where he began performing with the Lonesome Cowboys in 1935 and soon formed his own band, playing in local clubs and on radio in Flint and Pontiac.

Drafted into the Army in 1943, McDonald served in North Africa and the Far East during World War II, earning a Bronze Star. After the war, he returned to Michigan and began recording for Fortune Records in 1950 with Johnnie White and his Rough Riders, also releasing music under the name Skeets Saunders for London and Mercury Records. In 1951, McDonald moved to Los Angeles, becoming a regular on Cliffie Stone's 'Hometown Jamboree' and later 'Town Hall Party.' Signed by Capitol Records as their answer to Lefty Frizzell, he was encouraged to focus on honky tonk and country, despite his interest in rockabilly. His 1952 hit 'Don't Let the Stars Get in Your Eyes' topped the country charts for 18 weeks, and he continued recording prolifically, later signing with Columbia and recording in Nashville with top session musicians.

McDonald’s style was rooted in honky tonk, but he also experimented with rockabilly, helping to bridge the gap between country and early rock and roll. Though not as widely recognized as some contemporaries, his influence persisted through his recordings, television appearances, and live performances across the U.S. He died in Los Angeles on March 31, 1968, leaving behind a legacy as a dedicated performer who contributed significantly to the evolution of country music.
