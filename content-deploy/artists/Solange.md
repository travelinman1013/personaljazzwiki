## Biography
Solange Piaget Knowles, born June 24, 1986 in Houston, Texas, is an American singer, songwriter, and actress known for her innovative contributions to alternative R&B and neo soul. Raised in a musical family—her father Mathew Knowles managed Destiny’s Child, which included her older sister Beyoncé—Solange expressed an early interest in music and dance, performing as a backup dancer for Destiny’s Child at age 14. She began writing songs at nine and released her debut album, 'Solo Star,' at 16, marking the start of a career characterized by artistic independence and experimentation.[1][2][4]

After early forays into pop and acting, Solange shifted her musical style with her second album, 'Sol-Angel and the Hadley St. Dreams' (2008), drawing inspiration from Motown and 1970s soul. This album received critical acclaim and established her as a distinctive voice in contemporary R&B. Her subsequent projects, including the EP 'True' (2012) and the album 'A Seat at the Table' (2016), further showcased her genre-blending approach, tackling themes of identity, empowerment, and social justice. 'A Seat at the Table' debuted at number one in the US and won her a Grammy for Best R&B Performance for 'Cranes in the Sky.'[2][3][5]

Solange’s legacy lies in her fearless artistic vision and her role as a cultural innovator. She founded Saint Records in 2013 to support progressive R&B artists and has collaborated with museums and ballet companies, notably composing for the New York City Ballet in 2022. Her work is celebrated for its introspective lyrics, eclectic production, and commitment to elevating Black artistry and narratives.[3][5]
