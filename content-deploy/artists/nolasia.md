## Biography
Based on the available search results, there appears to be confusion regarding 'Nolasia' as a distinct musical artist. The search results reference NolasiA, which is a musical duo consisting of DJ Smith on bansuri (Indian bamboo flute) and his twin brother Idak on guitar, both originally from New Orleans and having lived in Asia for many years. Their music is categorized as crossover jazz, featuring instrumental compositions such as 'Delilah,' 'All Blues,' 'Summertime,' and 'Sambalero.' However, the Spotify context provided indicates 'Nolasia' as a UK R&B artist with a popularity score of 42, which does not align with the NolasiA duo profile found in the search results. The discrepancy suggests either a spelling variation, a different artist entirely, or incomplete information in the available sources.
