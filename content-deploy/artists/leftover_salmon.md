- **Origin**: Boulder, Colorado, United States

## Biography
Leftover Salmon is a pioneering American jamgrass band formed in 1989 in Boulder, Colorado, when Vince Herman’s Cajun‑jug outfit the Salmon Heads joined forces with Drew Emmitt’s progressive bluegrass group the Left Hand String Band for a New Year’s Eve show in Crested Butte.[1][2] Banjo player Mark Vann soon completed the core trio—known to fans as “the Big Three”—and together they forged a distinctive sound that mixed bluegrass instrumentation with rock energy, country twang, and Cajun rhythms, a fusion they dubbed **“polyethnic Cajun slamgrass.”**[1][2][3] Early albums such as *Bridges to Bert* (1993), *Ask the Fish* (1995), and *Euphoria* helped establish them on the national circuit, including slots on the H.O.R.D.E. tour and a deal with Hollywood Records, while their raucous live shows made them favorites at festivals like Telluride and RockyGrass.[1][2][8]

Through the late 1990s and early 2000s, Leftover Salmon deepened their genre‑blending approach with projects like *The Nashville Sessions* (1999), featuring guests Waylon Jennings, Béla Fleck, and Jerry Douglas, and *O’ Cracker Where Art Thou?* (2003), a collaborative reimagining of songs by the rock band Cracker.[1][2] The group was shaken by the death of Mark Vann in 2002, followed by a hiatus beginning in 2004, but they reunited in 2007 and gradually rebuilt around founding members Herman and Emmitt with a renewed lineup that eventually included banjoist Andy Thorn, bassist Greg Garrison, drummer Alwyn Robinson, and multi‑instrumentalist Jay Starling.[1][2] Recent releases such as *High Country*, the live collection *25*, and *Something Higher* (2018) underscore their continued evolution as they balance traditional bluegrass roots with psychedelic improvisation and rock dynamics, earning them recognition as elder statesmen of the jamgrass scene and inductees into the Colorado Music Hall of Fame.[1][2][6][8]

Across more than three decades, Leftover Salmon has become a crucial link between classic progressive bluegrass and the modern jam band world, often credited with helping launch the “jamgrass” movement by showing how a bluegrass‑based ensemble could incorporate drums, electric instruments, and extended improvisation without losing its acoustic soul.[2][4][6] Their influence can be heard in a generation of younger acts—such as Greensky Bluegrass, Yonder Mountain String Band, and Billy Strings—who have followed Salmon’s example in blending virtuosic picking with rock‑festival aesthetics.[6] Celebrated in the biography *Leftover Salmon: Thirty Years of Festival!* and still a constant presence on the touring and festival circuit, the band’s legacy rests on its ability to keep traditional music alive while relentlessly pushing it into new, genre‑defying territory.[1][6][9]

- The band was born from a single New Year’s Eve gig in Crested Butte, Colorado, when the Salmon Heads and the Left Hand String Band combined forces and adopted the impromptu name Leftover Salmon on the way to the show.[1][2]
- In 2003 they released *O’ Cracker Where Art Thou?*, an entire album of Cracker songs rearranged in Leftover Salmon’s slamgrass style, featuring Cracker’s own David Lowery and Johnny Hickman.[1]
- Their 30‑year history was documented in a dedicated band biography titled *Leftover Salmon: Thirty Years of Festival!*, underscoring their deep connection to the American festival circuit.[1][9]
