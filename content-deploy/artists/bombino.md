## Biography
Bombino, born Goumar Almoctar in 1980 in Tidene, near Agadez, Niger, is a celebrated Tuareg guitarist and songwriter whose music embodies the spirit and struggles of his people. Raised in the Ifoghas tribe, Bombino's early life was shaped by political unrest, notably the Tuareg Rebellion of 1990, which forced his family into exile in Algeria. It was during this period that Bombino discovered the guitar, teaching himself to play and later studying under the renowned Tuareg guitarist Haja Bebe, who invited him to join his band and gave him the nickname 'Bombino,' derived from the Italian word for 'little child.'[2][4]

Bombino's formative years were marked by hardship and resilience; he spent time in Algeria and Libya, working as a herder and honing his guitar skills by emulating Western icons like Jimi Hendrix and Mark Knopfler through video study. Returning to Niger in the late 1990s, Bombino quickly gained recognition as a skilled musician, performing at weddings, political rallies, and local ceremonies. His career took a significant turn in 2009 when filmmaker Ron Wyman tracked him down in exile in Burkina Faso, following the murder of two band members during renewed Tuareg unrest. Wyman featured Bombino in a documentary and produced his debut solo album, propelling Bombino onto the international stage.[1][2][4]

Bombino's musical style, often categorized as 'desert blues,' fuses traditional Tuareg melodies and rhythms with modern rock and blues influences. His lyrics frequently address themes of peace, unity, and the plight of the Tuareg people. Bombino's legacy is defined by his role as a cultural ambassador, using his guitar not as a weapon but as a tool to build understanding and preserve Tuareg heritage. He has become one of the most prominent figures in Saharan music, inspiring a new generation of artists and bringing global attention to the music and struggles of the Tuareg.[2][4]
