## Biography
The Goo Goo Dolls are an American rock band formed in 1986 in Buffalo, New York, by John Rzeznik (guitar, vocals), Robby Takac (bass, vocals), and George Tutuska (drums). Initially known as the Sex Maggots, they changed their name after a club owner objected, selecting 'Goo Goo Dolls' from a True Detective magazine ad for a toy. Starting as a cover band influenced by punk acts like Hüsker Dü and The Replacements, they developed a raw punk-metal sound, releasing their debut album in 1987 on Mercenary Records, followed by Jed (1989) and Hold Me Up (1990) on Metal Blade Records[1][2][3].

Breakthrough came with their 1995 album A Boy Named Goo, propelled by the acoustic ballad 'Name,' which hit Top Five on charts and drove platinum sales, though Tutuska was fired just before release and replaced by Mike Malinin. Their sound shifted to mainstream adult-oriented rock (AOR) with the 1998 album Dizzy Up the Girl, featuring 'Iris'—written for the City of Angels soundtrack—which topped Hot 100 Airplay for 18 weeks and spent 11 months on the Hot 100. Subsequent albums like Gutterflower (2002), Let Love In (2006), and others produced multiple top 10 Adult Top 40 hits, setting records with 14 top ten hot AC singles[1][2][3].

The band has released 12 studio albums through 2019's Miracle Pill, evolving from punk roots to melodic rock while maintaining a strong live presence, including a rain-soaked 2004 hometown concert. Core members Rzeznik and Takac remain, with Malinin departing in 2013; they continue touring and recording from their Buffalo base[1][2][3].
