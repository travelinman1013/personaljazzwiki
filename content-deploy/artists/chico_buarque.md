## Biography
Chico Buarque (Francisco Buarque de Hollanda), born July 19, 1944, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, is one of the most influential figures in Brazilian music and culture. Raised in a prominent intellectual family—his father was historian Sérgio Buarque de Holanda—Chico spent his youth between Brazil and Europe, which exposed him to a wide range of artistic and cultural influences. He initially studied architecture at the University of São Paulo but abandoned his studies in the mid-1960s to pursue music full-time[1][2].

Buarque's musical career began in earnest in 1964, and he quickly rose to national prominence after bossa nova star Nara Leão recorded three of his compositions. His breakthrough came in 1966 with the song "A Banda," which won a national music contest and became an instant classic[4]. Throughout the late 1960s and 1970s, Buarque became a leading voice in MPB (Música Popular Brasileira), bossa nova, and samba, known for his lyrical sophistication and social commentary. His work often challenged Brazil's military dictatorship, leading to censorship and a period of voluntary exile in Italy from 1969 to 1970[1][5].

Beyond music, Chico Buarque is an accomplished novelist, playwright, and poet, with works that explore Brazilian identity, politics, and everyday life. His legacy is defined by his innovative approach to samba and bossa nova, his resistance to authoritarianism, and his profound impact on generations of musicians and writers. He remains a beloved and respected figure, celebrated for both his artistic achievements and his role as a cultural icon[3][6].
