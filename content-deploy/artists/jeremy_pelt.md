## Biography
Jeremy Pelt (born November 4, 1976) is an American jazz trumpeter, composer, producer, and educator, widely regarded as one of the leading trumpet voices of his generation.[3][5][8] Born in California, he began playing trumpet in elementary school with an initial focus on classical music, only turning seriously to jazz when he joined his high school jazz band.[5][6] After graduating from high school, Pelt moved east to attend the Berklee College of Music in Boston, where he studied Professional Music and film scoring by day while gaining practical experience performing at night.[3][5][6] He completed his studies at Berklee in 1998 and relocated to New York City, quickly drawing the attention of established bandleaders on the scene.[5][6]

Pelt’s first major professional engagement was with the Mingus Big Band, an association that opened doors to long‑term relationships with many top New York musicians and positioned him within the legacy of Charles Mingus’s music.[1][4][5] From there he worked with ensembles such as the Roy Hargrove Big Band, the Village Vanguard Orchestra, the Duke Ellington Big Band, the Lewis Nash Septet, and Louis Hayes’ Cannonball Adderley Legacy Band, while also appearing with artists including Ravi Coltrane, Roy Hargrove, Greg Osby, Jimmy Heath, Cassandra Wilson, and Lonnie Plaxico.[2][3][4][5] As a leader he has recorded numerous albums for labels such as Fresh Sound New Talent and others, leading groups ranging from acoustic post‑bop ensembles to semi‑electric bands incorporating Rhodes, guitar, and effects, and he has toured extensively at major jazz festivals and concert venues in the United States and Europe.[1][4][5][7]

Stylistically, Pelt is often linked to the virtuosic hard‑bop trumpet tradition, drawing particular inspiration from Freddie Hubbard, Booker Little, and Chet Baker, while his compositional language shows an affinity for the harmonic and structural approaches of Wayne Shorter.[2] Critics and peers have praised his modern sound, forward momentum, and sense of urgency, and he has been repeatedly recognized by the jazz press: he was featured in a major Wall Street Journal article by Nat Hentoff and was voted “Rising Star” on trumpet five years in a row by both DownBeat Magazine and the Jazz Journalists Association.[1][4][5] In addition to his performing and recording career, Pelt is active as an educator and mentor, presenting himself as a staunch advocate for jazz and its continued evolution while extending the lineage of post‑bop trumpet into the twenty‑first century.[4][5][7][8]
