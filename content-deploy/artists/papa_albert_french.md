## Biography
Albert "Papa" French Sr. (November 16, 1910 – September 28, 1977) was a renowned American jazz musician, celebrated for his mastery of the banjo and his leadership in the vibrant New Orleans jazz scene[1][3][4]. Born and raised in New Orleans, Louisiana, French became an integral part of the city's musical heritage, performing with legendary bands and musicians throughout his career. He was particularly noted for his tenure with Papa Celestin's Original Tuxedo Jazz Band, one of the oldest and most influential jazz ensembles in New Orleans[2][4].

Following the death of Oscar "Papa" Celestin in 1954, French assumed leadership of the Original Tuxedo Jazz Band, continuing its legacy and ensuring its place in jazz history[2]. Under his direction, the band maintained its traditional New Orleans jazz style, characterized by lively rhythms, ensemble improvisation, and a strong sense of community. French's dedication to the authentic sound of New Orleans jazz made him a respected figure among musicians and audiences alike.

Papa French's influence extended beyond his own performances, as he mentored younger musicians and contributed to the preservation of New Orleans jazz. His legacy is carried on by his family, notably his grandson Gerald French, who leads the current iteration of the Original Tuxedo Jazz Band[2]. French's commitment to tradition and his role in sustaining the city's musical culture have made him a lasting icon in American jazz.
