## Biography
Zig Zags is a Los Angeles-based heavy metal and punk rock trio that emerged from the underground music scene in 2010. The band was formed when singer/guitarist Jed Maheu and drummer Bobby Martin began writing music together, initially performing as a duo before bassist Patrick McCarthy joined to complete the lineup. The band's name derives not from the famous rolling paper brand, but rather from a slang term for cheap canvas shoes that both Maheu and Martin were wearing at the time of the band's formation. Their early releases included a 7-inch single titled 'Monster Wizard' on Tubesteak Tuesday, followed by several other singles, and notably a 2012 cover of Betty Davis' 'If I'm in Luck I Might Get Picked Up' featuring Iggy Pop, which helped establish their presence in the underground rock community.

The band's sonic identity has been characterized by music critics as occupying a 'Venn diagram connecting Black Sabbath, Black Flag and Motörhead,' blending heavy metal riffing with punk rock's raw energy and attitude. Their self-titled debut album, released in 2014 and recorded/mixed by producer Ty Segall, marked a significant milestone with the single 'Brainded Warrior.' By 2016, the band underwent significant lineup changes, with both Martin and McCarthy departing and being replaced by drummer Dane Arnold and bassist Sean Hoffman (who transitioned from his role as the band's longtime recording engineer). The band continued to evolve throughout the late 2010s, releasing their fourth album 'They'll Never Take Us Alive' in 2019 on RidingEasy Records, which featured the aggressive single 'Punk Fucking Metal' and solidified their reputation as a vital force in contemporary heavy punk and metal fusion.

## Fun Facts

- Both founding members Jed Maheu and Bobby Martin were originally guitarists before Martin transitioned to drums, allowing the band to evolve from a guitar duo into a full trio.
- The band recorded a cover of Betty Davis' 'If I'm in Luck I Might Get Picked Up' featuring Iggy Pop in 2012, early in their career, which helped establish their credibility in the underground rock scene.
