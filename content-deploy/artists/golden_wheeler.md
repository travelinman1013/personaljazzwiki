## Biography
Golden 'Big' Wheeler, born on December 15, 1929, in Beaconton, Georgia, discovered blues music early through the sound of an acoustic guitar in the country night. He left home as a young man in 1941, eventually arriving in Chicago in July 1954, where he was inspired by Little Walter's performance at 38th and State, leading to a friendship with the legendary harp player. Wheeler took up harmonica while working as a taxi driver, influenced by regular customer Buster Brown, known for his 1960 hit 'Fannie Mae'. By 1956, he fronted his own band as a part-time musician, supplementing income as an auto mechanic to support his family.[1][3]

Wheeler immersed himself in the Chicago blues scene for decades, becoming a respected harmonica player, singer, and songwriter in the modern and electric blues styles. His debut album, Bone Orchard, released in 1993 on Delmark Records after 40 years on the circuit, featured backing by the Ice Cream Men (Johnny Burgin, Dave Waldman, Steve Cushing) in a 1950s two-guitars-and-drums style. His second album, Jump In, recorded in 1997 and produced by Bob Koester, showcased a fuller Chicago blues sound with his brother James Wheeler on guitar, Allen Batts on piano, Bob Stroger on bass, and Baldhead Pete on drums. He transitioned to full-time music in the late 1980s.[1][4]

Golden 'Big' Wheeler released only two albums but left a lasting mark as a vibrant traditional Chicago blues artist known for his swooping harmonica, original compositions, and unique voice. He passed away from heart failure in Chicago on July 20, 1998, at age 68, remembered as a personable legend of the Windy City blues scene.[1][2]
