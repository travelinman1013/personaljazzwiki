## Biography
Eric Alexander and Vincent Herring represent a powerful saxophone duo in contemporary jazz, each bringing distinct voices and extensive experience to their collaborations. Eric Alexander, born August 4, 1968, in Illinois, began as a classical musician studying alto saxophone at Indiana University before switching to jazz and tenor saxophone at William Paterson University. Vincent Herring, born November 19, 1964, in Kentucky and raised in California, started playing saxophone at age 11 in school bands while studying privately at Dean Frederick's School of Music in Vallejo, California.

Both saxophonists developed their careers through mentorship with jazz legends and extensive sideman work. Alexander placed second at the 1991 Thelonious Monk International Jazz Saxophone Competition, launching his recording career with over 20 albums as a leader and over 300 as a sideman. Herring moved to New York City in the early 1980s, first touring with the Lionel Hampton Big Band before forging a nine-year musical relationship with Nat Adderley, producing nine albums together. After Nat's death, Herring collaborated with Louis Hayes to form the Cannonball Adderley Legacy Band.

Their musical partnership spans over two decades, beginning with their first 'saxophone battle' in 2005 and evolving into a celebrated collaboration. Their playing styles complement each other perfectly - Alexander's robust tenor saxophone approach paired with Herring's intense, soulful alto saxophone work influenced by Julian 'Cannonball' Adderley. Together, they represent the continuation of the straight-ahead jazz tradition while bringing their own contemporary voices to the music, frequently performing with top-tier rhythm sections and maintaining active careers as both performers and jazz educators.
