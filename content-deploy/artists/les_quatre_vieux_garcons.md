## Biography
Les Quatre Vieux Garçons, translating to 'The Four Bachelors,' was a Cajun music ensemble active in the 1980s, known for performing rousing sets of traditional Cajun tunes and songs. The group featured prominent Cajun fiddler Dewey Balfa (1927-1992), alongside Tony Balfa, Tracy Schwarz, and Peter Schwarz, who together captured the lively spirit of southwest Louisiana's French-speaking Cajun culture on their 1984 album of the same name, originally released by Folkways Records.[4][5][7] Their music aligned with the Cajun genre, characterized by fiddle-driven 4/4 two-steps and 3/4 waltzes, often accompanied by stomping rhythms and homemade triangles, distinguishing it from the accordion-led zydeco style despite occasional cultural overlaps.[3]

Formed as a collaborative project, Les Quatre Vieux Garçons contributed to the preservation and revival of Cajun music during a period when Dewey Balfa was actively promoting the tradition through performances and recordings. The group's album, reissued by Smithsonian Folkways, showcased their energetic renditions in Cajun style, helping to bring regional folk music to wider audiences via festivals and educational outreach.[4][6][8] While specific details on the group's formation or individual early lives beyond Balfa's are limited, their work embodied the communal house dance ('La La') traditions blending French, Acadian, and Creole elements.[3]

The legacy of Les Quatre Vieux Garçons lies in documenting authentic Cajun sounds amid a fading oral tradition, with Dewey Balfa's involvement underscoring efforts to sustain cultural heritage against modernization. Their recordings remain available through Smithsonian Folkways, serving as an archival touchstone for Cajun music enthusiasts.[4][7]
