## Biography
Tonstartssbandht is a neo-psychedelic duo formed by brothers Andy and Edwin White in Orlando, Florida, in August 2007. Their early musical experiences were shaped by singing together at home and participating in boy choir, which helped hone their vocal skills and fostered a unique sibling synergy[1][2]. Initially, they did not play music together, but as teenagers, they realized the creative potential of their bond and began collaborating, leading to the formation of Tonstartssbandht[1].

The band's career has been marked by a restless, experimental spirit and a DIY ethos. Their sound evolved from vocal-heavy, loop-laden noise pop to a more expansive psychedelic boogie rock, characterized by intricate guitar work, dynamic drumming, and ethereal harmonies[1][2][8]. Recording sessions often took place in unconventional settings—apartments in Montreal and New York, on the road, or in Brooklyn's punk house 'The Wallet'—before settling into a more traditional studio process for their 2021 album 'Petunia'[2]. Their music is noted for its improvisational energy, blending influences from Brian Wilson's vocal pop to jam bands and synth-pop, and they have built a loyal following through extensive touring, including memorable shows in Eastern Europe and Russia[2].

Tonstartssbandht's legacy lies in their commitment to creative freedom and their influence on the underground psychedelic scene. While their esoteric style has kept them outside the mainstream, they are celebrated for their innovative approach to songwriting and recording, their close-knit musical partnership, and their impact on indie and experimental music communities[1][2][7].
