## Biography
Clifton Chenier, known as the "King of Zydeco," was born on June 25, 1925, in the countryside near Opelousas, Louisiana, to sharecropper parents. He learned to play the accordion from his father Joseph, reportedly starting around age eight or nine when he would sneak into the rumble seat of family friends' Model A Ford to attend dances. Chenier once joked about his humble origins: "I come from out a hole, man, I mean out the mud, they had to dig me out the mud to bring me into town." In 1947, he moved to Port Arthur, Texas, where he divided his time between working in the oil fields—driving refinery trucks and hauling pipe for Gulf and Texaco—and performing with his brother Cleveland, a rub board player, at taverns, weddings, and picnics throughout the Texas-Louisiana bayous.

Chenier's recording career began in 1954 when he signed with Elko Records, producing the regional hit "Cliston's Blues" and "Louisiana Stomp." His national breakthrough came in 1955 with "Ay-Tete-Fille (Hey Little Girl)" on Specialty Records, produced by Bumps Blackwell (best known for his work with Little Richard). By 1956, Chenier left his day job to tour full-time with his band, the Zydeco Ramblers. The turning point in his career came in 1964 when Chris Strachwitz signed him to Arhoolie Records and encouraged him to focus more on his zydeco roots, resulting in the album "Louisiana Blues and Zydeco." His 1966 appearance at the Berkeley Blues Festival exposed him to wider audiences and sparked national interest in zydeco music. Throughout the 1970s, he recorded several acclaimed albums for Arhoolie, including the quintessential "Bogalusa Boogie" (1976), and formed the Red Hot Louisiana Band.

Chenier's musical innovation lay in mixing Cajun and French two-steps and waltzes with blues, R&B, and rock and roll, creating the infectious sound of modern zydeco. Despite suffering from severe diabetes that required weekly kidney dialysis and resulted in a partially amputated foot, Chenier continued performing until one week before his death. In 1982, he recorded "I'm Here!" in Bogalusa, Louisiana—his first album since 1978—which became Alligator Records' first Grammy-winning album in 1983. The following year, he performed at the White House. Chenier died on December 12, 1987, at Lafayette General Hospital at age 62, but his legacy as zydeco's great ambassador and the genre's undisputed king endures.

## Fun Facts
- Chenier was famous for his flashy onstage gear including a cape, crown, and a distinctive gold tooth, earning him the title 'King of Zydeco.'
- As a child around age 8 or 9, he would sneak into the rumble seat of family friends' Model A Ford to attend dances, and when they arrived it was too far for him to walk back home, so they had no choice but to let him stay and listen.
- The word 'zydeco' is thought to be a corruption of the French word 'haricot,' from the Cajun expression about dancing—'snap a bean'—referring to the infectious dance music style Chenier pioneered.
- Despite severe diabetes requiring dialysis treatment every three days and having a partially amputated foot, Chenier continued touring and performing until just one week before his death, even completing a Northeast tour shortly before Thanksgiving 1987.
- His 1982 album 'I'm Here!' was recorded in just eight hours in Bogalusa, Louisiana, and was a testament to his strength and courage—doctors had previously told him he would never be able to tour or record again.
