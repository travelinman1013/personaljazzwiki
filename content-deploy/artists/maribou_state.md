## Biography
Maribou State is a British electronic music duo consisting of Chris Davids and Liam Ivory from Hertfordshire.[1] The pair initially collaborated in a traditional band setup when Liam asked Chris to play bass, but when they moved north to attend university, the band dissolved and they pivoted to creating electronic music in their home studio.[1] In the summer of 2011, they were discovered by Fat! Records and released their debut 'Olivia' EP, establishing their signature bass-heavy, melodic sound.[1] Their early momentum was fueled by viral bootleg remixes and critical acclaim—notably, their remix of Crookers' 'Hummus' topped the Hype Machine chart in spring 2012, and their track 'The Look' from the 'Native' EP received a 10/10 rating and Tune of the Month from Mixmag.[1]

The duo achieved significant recognition with their 2015 debut album 'Portraits,' which showcased a sophisticated blend of electronics and live instrumentation inspired by British music history, drawing from 80s soul-funk, 90s trip-hop, and contemporary artists like James Blake, Mount Kimbie, and Burial.[4] They have since performed at major venues worldwide, including Glastonbury and the Sydney Opera House, with their 2019 Glastonbury performance at the West Holts stage marking one of the most significant shows of their career.[2] Their third album, 'Hallucinating Love,' released in January 2025 on Ninja Tune, represents their most personal work to date, conceived during a challenging period from 2020 onwards when both members dealt with various physical and mental health issues that ultimately informed the album's emotional depth and hopeful sonic palette.[2][4]

## Fun Facts
