## Biography
FKA twigs, born Tahliah Debrett Barnett on January 16, 1988, in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, England, is a groundbreaking English singer, songwriter, producer, and dancer. Raised by her mother, a dancer and gymnast, Barnett was exposed to the arts from an early age and began making music in youth clubs as a teenager. At 17, she moved to South London to pursue a career as a dancer, quickly becoming a sought-after backup dancer for artists like Kylie Minogue and Ed Sheeran, and appearing in high-profile music videos such as Jessie J’s 'Price Tag.'

Twigs transitioned to music with her debut EP, 'EP1,' in 2012, followed by 'EP2' in 2013, which she co-produced with Arca. Her first full-length album, 'LP1' (2014), received critical acclaim, reaching #16 on the UK Albums Chart and earning a Mercury Prize nomination. Known for her genre-bending sound that fuses art pop, alternative R&B, electronic, and avant-garde influences, she continued to innovate with releases like 'M3LL155X' (2015), 'Magdalene' (2019), and the mixtape 'Caprisongs' (2022). In 2025, she released 'Eusexua,' widely regarded as a masterful pop statement. Twigs is celebrated for her ethereal vocals, experimental production, and visually arresting performances, establishing her as a leading figure in contemporary art pop and alternative R&B.

Her legacy is defined by her fearless experimentation and multidisciplinary artistry, influencing a new generation of musicians and performers. Twigs’ work is noted for its emotional intimacy, genre fluidity, and striking visual storytelling, making her a polymath who continues to push the boundaries of modern music and performance art.
