## Biography
Maxwell Lemuel Roach was born on January 10, 1924, in Newland, North Carolina, but grew up in Brooklyn, New York. His early exposure to music came from his mother, a gospel singer, and he began playing drums at age ten. Roach's formal musical education took him to the Manhattan School of Music, where he studied composition. He became a pivotal figure in the bebop era, known for his innovative drumming style that emphasized the ride cymbal, allowing for faster tempos and greater rhythmic complexity.

Throughout his career, he continued to evolve, exploring various musical genres and becoming a fervent advocate for civil rights. In the 1970s, Roach founded the percussion ensemble M'Boom, further expanding his musical horizons. His legacy as one of the most influential drummers in jazz history remains unparalleled. Roach passed away on August 16, 2007, in New York City. His contributions to jazz have been recognized with numerous awards, including being inducted into the DownBeat Hall of Fame in 1980 and the Modern Drummer Hall of Fame in 1992.
