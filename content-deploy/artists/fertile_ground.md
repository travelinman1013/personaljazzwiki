## Biography
Fertile Ground is an American soul jazz band that emerged from Baltimore in the late 1990s as a dynamic force in independent music. Founded by James H. Collins Jr., the group was established as a three-piece ensemble featuring vocalist Navasha Daya and drummer Marcus Asante, whose warm vocals and rhythmic grooves formed the sonic foundation of the band's identity.
