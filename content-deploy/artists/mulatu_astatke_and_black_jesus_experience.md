## Biography
Mulatu Astatke & Black Jesus Experience is the name given to the ongoing collaboration between Ethiopian vibraphonist, composer and Ethio‑jazz pioneer **Mulatu Astatke** and Melbourne‑based Ethio‑jazz/hip‑hop collective **Black Jesus Experience**. Their partnership began in **Addis Ababa in 2009**, when the group, already known in Australia for fusing traditional Ethiopian melodies with funk and hip‑hop, met Astatke and quickly developed both a musical relationship and a close friendship.[1][2][3] Astatke, long celebrated as the “Father of Ethio‑jazz” for his innovative blend of jazz and funk with Ethiopia’s pentatonic scales, found in Black Jesus Experience a flexible, groove‑driven ensemble able to extend his sound for contemporary global audiences, leading him to call them “my favourite backing band” and even “family.”[1][2]

From that first meeting the project grew into regular touring and recording. Together they undertook Australian tours that earned **The Age “Best Tour 2010” award**, and went on to perform across Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and Ethiopia, including a notable concert at the **United Nations in Addis Ababa** marking 50 years of Australian representation at the African Union.[1][5][8] In the studio, their collaboration produced the album **“Cradle of Humanity”** (2016), premiered at the Melbourne Jazz Festival and followed by tours, and a second joint album **“To Know Without Knowing”** (2020), recorded and mixed across three continents and praised in the international press, including being named **The Guardian’s Jazz Album of the Month** and a Bandcamp “Album of the Day.”[3][4][6] Musically, the project is characterised by Astatke’s modal vibraphone‑ and horn‑driven Ethio‑jazz language set against Black Jesus Experience’s “global‑funk” rhythm section, MC‑led hip‑hop vocals and Ethiopian song forms, creating an **irresistibly danceable alloy of traditional Ethiopian music, jazz, hip‑hop and funk** that both preserves and updates the Ethio‑jazz tradition for new generations.[2][3][4] Their work together has reinforced Astatke’s legacy as a global ambassador of Ethiopian music while cementing Black Jesus Experience as one of the key modern exponents of Ethio‑jazz outside Ethiopia.[2][4][6]
