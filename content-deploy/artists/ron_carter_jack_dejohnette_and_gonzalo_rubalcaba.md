## Biography
Ron Carter, Jack DeJohnette, and Gonzalo Rubalcaba form a superlative jazz trio, each bringing decades of innovation and mastery to the group. Their collaboration is most notably captured on the Grammy-winning album 'Skyline' (2021), which showcases their dynamic interplay and deep musical conversation. Gonzalo Rubalcaba, a Cuban-born pianist, was raised in Havana and began his career immersed in Afro-Cuban rhythms before moving to the Dominican Republic in 1991 and later Miami in 1996. Rubalcaba's early professional experiences included formative collaborations with Carter and DeJohnette, whom he regards as key mentors who shaped his artistic approach[1][3][6].

Ron Carter, one of the most recorded jazz bassists in history, and Jack DeJohnette, a legendary drummer known for his work with Miles Davis and Keith Jarrett, bring their expansive experience and unique voices to the trio. Their musical style on 'Skyline' blends Afro-Cuban influences, classic jazz, and improvisational dialogue, creating a sound that is both rooted in tradition and forward-looking. The album features reimagined standards, original compositions, and Cuban classics, all performed with a relaxed yet deeply connected approach that highlights the trio's mutual respect and joy in making music together[2][4][5].

The legacy of this trio is marked by their ability to merge diverse backgrounds into a unified artistic vision. Their work on 'Skyline' is celebrated for its rich rhythmic textures, sophisticated harmonies, and the palpable sense of camaraderie. Each member is a luminary in their own right, but together, they elevate the piano trio format to new heights, influencing a new generation of jazz musicians and listeners[6][3].

## Fun Facts
- The album 'Skyline' was the first in a planned trilogy of piano trio records by Rubalcaba, with Carter and DeJohnette chosen specifically for their ability to blend Afro-Cuban rhythms with jazz[1].
- After the official recording session for 'Skyline' ended, the trio continued to play for fun; the impromptu jam was accidentally recorded and became the final track, 'RonJackRuba'[2].
- Rubalcaba wrote a piece dedicated to Ron Carter years before the 'Skyline' sessions, but performing it with Carter himself brought a new emotional depth to the music[2].
- The trio's chemistry is so strong that they often reimagine familiar tunes, infusing them with new life and personal touches unique to their collective experience[2][4].
