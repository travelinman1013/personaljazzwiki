## Biography
Carrie Wicks is a Seattle-based jazz vocalist known for her restrained, deeply musical style and ability to co-write genre-busting songs. Emerging from the Pacific Northwest jazz scene, she debuted with the album *I'll Get Around to It*, where she established herself as a convincing storyteller through smartly composed originals and strong phrasing.[5][6] By her third album, *Maybe*, Wicks had solidified her recording career, emphasizing original material sung with warmth and individuality.[3]

Her musical style features laidback ballads and slow-to-medium pieces ideal for relaxed listening, often with a hint of huskiness, melancholy, and innovative elements like slow scat. On *Reverie*, released in 2019, she performs nine originals co-written with Ken Nottingham or Nick Allison, alongside standards like *Some Other Spring*, accompanied by musicians such as pianist Bill Anschell, bassist Jeff Johnson, drummer D’Vonne Lewis, and saxophonist Brent Jensen.[1] Wicks' work blends vocal jazz with smooth jazz influences, showcasing good timing and a soft crooning approach suited to pretty melodies and intimate settings.[1][2][4]

Though not a mainstream figure (Spotify popularity: 2), Wicks maintains a niche legacy in the US jazz community, particularly Seattle, through consistent releases on OA2 Records and her distinctive sound that appeals to fans of thoughtful, low-key vocal jazz.[1][3][5]
