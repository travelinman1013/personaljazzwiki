## Biography
Stanley Turrentine, born April 5, 1934, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, emerged as one of the most influential tenor saxophonists in jazz, renowned for his thick, blues-infused tone and soulful phrasing. Growing up in a musical family—his brother Tommy was a noted trumpeter—Stanley was inspired early by the likes of Illinois Jacquet and Gene Ammons, and by age 12 was already sitting in with Jacquet himself. Turrentine's professional career began in the early 1950s, playing with blues and R&B bands, including Lowell Fulson's group (with Ray Charles) and later replacing John Coltrane in Earl Bostic's band. His national profile rose after joining Max Roach's quintet in 1959, alongside his brother Tommy, and he soon became a sought-after session player in the burgeoning soul-jazz scene.

Turrentine's collaboration with The Three Sounds—a hard-swinging jazz trio comprised of Gene Harris (piano), Andrew Simpkins (bass), and Bill Dowdy (drums)—culminated in the celebrated 1961 Blue Note album 'Blue Hour.' This record showcased a seamless blend of Turrentine's bluesy, expressive tenor with the trio's groove-oriented, blues-rooted style, resulting in a classic of the soul-jazz and hard bop genres. Throughout the 1960s and '70s, Turrentine continued to record prolifically for Blue Note and later CTI, working with organist Shirley Scott (his then-wife), Jimmy Smith, and many others. His legacy endures as a master of soulful jazz improvisation, bridging blues, hard bop, and jazz fusion until his passing in 2000.
