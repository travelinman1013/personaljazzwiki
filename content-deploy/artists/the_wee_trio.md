## Biography
The Wee Trio is an American jazz group formed in Brooklyn in 2007, consisting of James Westfall (vibraphone and marimba), Dan Loomis (acoustic bass), and Jared Schonig (drums). The members hail from diverse musical backgrounds—Westfall from the South, Loomis from the Midwest, and Schonig from the West Coast—and their paths converged in New York City after Loomis and Schonig developed a close musical rapport at the Eastman School of Music. Their debut album, 'Capitol Diner, Vol. 1' (2008), garnered international acclaim and was recognized among the top jazz albums of the year by outlets such as The San Francisco Chronicle and All About Jazz, establishing the group as a creative force in modern jazz.[1][2][4]

The Wee Trio is known for its adventurous approach to the jazz trio format, notably featuring vibraphone as the melodic lead—a rarity in jazz ensembles. Their music blends influences from New Orleans, modern jazz, and even rock, as seen in their 2012 project 'Ashes to Ashes: A David Bowie Intraspective,' which reimagined the music of David Bowie and expanded their audience beyond traditional jazz listeners.[1][3][6] The group’s live performances, such as those captured on 'Live At The Bistro' (2013), are celebrated for their energy, tight interplay, and inventive improvisation. Their 2016 album 'Wee + 3' featured collaborations with prominent jazz artists, further cementing their reputation for innovation and collaboration.[1][7]

The Wee Trio has performed at major venues and festivals across North America, including The New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, Birdland, The Kennedy Center, and The Ottawa Jazz Festival. Their willingness to push genre boundaries and their commitment to musical storytelling have made them influential figures in contemporary jazz, inspiring both peers and the next generation of improvisers.[1][2][8]
