## Biography
Matt Perrine, born and raised in Sacramento, California, began his musical career at age 10 playing trombone in school band, quickly advancing to tuba with a Dixieland group by 11, electric bass and arranging by 12, and acoustic bass and composition by 15. Before high school graduation, he performed with professionals including the Artie Shaw Orchestra, Jessica Williams, Diane Shure, and Joey Calderazzo. In 1992, he relocated to New Orleans, where he became a cornerstone of the local music scene as a virtuoso on sousaphone, tuba, upright bass, and electric bass, blending jazz, Dixieland, funk, brass band, rock, reggae, avant-garde, Latin, and swing.[1][2][3]

Perrine's career in New Orleans flourished through co-founding the New Orleans Nightcrawlers in 1995, where he serves as tubist, chief composer, arranger, and producer for albums like their self-titled debut, Live at the Old Point, and Slither Slice on Threadhead Records. He joined the Tin Men in the early 2000s with Alex McMurray and Washboard Chaz Leary, releasing albums such as Super Great Music for Modern Lovers and Hit It!, and became a key member of Bonerama's sousaphone lineup since around 1998, contributing to their brass funk rock sound. His solo project Sunflower City Band produced the acclaimed 2007 album Sunflower City, named Best CD by WWOZ-FM, followed by Bayou Road Suite in 2010, both on Threadhead. DownBeat magazine hailed him as a 'virtuoso sousaphone player,' and he has performed globally at venues like Sydney Opera House and Jazz at Lincoln Center.[1][2][3][4][5]

As an educator and arranger, Perrine teaches through New Orleans Young Audiences and traditional jazz camps, delivers clinics for Copenhagen's Rhythmik Music Conservatory, and has composed for ensembles like the Boston Pops and Bonerama. His involvement in HBO's Treme and projects like Nine Lives underscores his legacy as an innovator in New Orleans brass band and funk traditions.[1][3]
