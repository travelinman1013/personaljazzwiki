## Biography
Pee Wee Hunt, born Walter Gerhardt Hunt on May 10, 1907, in Mount Healthy, Ohio, was a prominent American jazz trombonist, vocalist, and bandleader. Raised in a musical family—his mother played banjo and his father violin—Hunt developed his musical interests early, initially playing banjo in local bands while attending Ohio State University. During his college years, he transitioned to trombone, which became his primary instrument.

Hunt's professional career began in earnest when he joined Jean Goldkette’s Orchestra in 1928, but he gained widespread recognition as a co-founder and featured trombonist of the Casa Loma Orchestra, one of the first successful big bands of the swing era. After leaving the Casa Loma Orchestra in 1943, Hunt worked as a Hollywood radio disc jockey and served in the Merchant Marine during World War II. He returned to music after the war, leading his own Dixieland combo and achieving major commercial success with hits like "Twelfth Street Rag" (1948) and "Oh!" (1952), both for Capitol Records. Hunt's style was rooted in Dixieland, ragtime, and swing, and he is credited with helping to revive interest in these genres during the late 1940s and 1950s.

Hunt's legacy endures through his recordings and his role in popularizing traditional jazz forms for new audiences. He was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his contributions to recording. He died on June 22, 1979, in Plymouth, Massachusetts.
