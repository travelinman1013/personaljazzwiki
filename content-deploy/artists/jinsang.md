## Biography
Benjamin Tran, known professionally as Jinsang, is a California-based producer born in the United States who began creating music around 2015 at the age of fifteen, just after finishing his first year of high school. Growing up listening to a diverse range of genres including jazz, hip-hop, and classical, he was drawn to lo-fi for its warmth and intimacy. Initially making beats for personal enjoyment, Jinsang uploaded his work to SoundCloud, where it gained traction through YouTube promotional channels like STEEZYASFUCK, 1171domino, Axian, and 88 Rising, establishing him as a staple in the lo-fi hip hop community.[1][2]

Jinsang's career developed rapidly with key releases such as the 51-minute album 'Solitude' (over 5 million views on YouTube) and tracks like 'affection' (nearly 8 million views), alongside albums including 'Life,' 'Blossoms' (2019), 'Transitions' (2020), and 'Boa Bunda' (2022). His distinctive style features soft, laid-back, nostalgic beats with mellow vibes, often sampling vinyl jazz records, emphasizing everyday inspirations like rain, coffee, and notebook scribbles to create intimate, mood-evoking spaces ideal for studying or relaxation. He has performed live at events like 'On the Pulse' in Los Angeles (2018), SXSW, Low End Theory, and Subtle Mindset festival in San Francisco.[1][2][3]

Jinsang's legacy lies in his authentic approach amid the growing lo-fi scene, advocating for originality over trends and imperfections that make music feel alive. His downtempo, electronic-infused lo-fi has built a devoted following, influencing the genre's emphasis on introspection and chill atmospheres while maintaining sincerity and simplicity.[1][3]
