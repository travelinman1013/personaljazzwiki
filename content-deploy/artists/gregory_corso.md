## Biography
Gregory Corso (1930–2001) was an American poet and a foundational figure of the Beat Generation, renowned for his experimental, lyrical, and often provocative verse. Born Nunzio Corso in New York City's Little Italy to teenage Italian immigrants, Corso endured a tumultuous childhood marked by abandonment, foster care, and homelessness. By his teens, he had spent time in reform schools and was incarcerated for theft at seventeen, where he began a rigorous self-education, reading the classics and developing his poetic voice.

After his release, Corso immersed himself in the burgeoning literary scene of Greenwich Village, where he met Allen Ginsberg in 1950, who became both a mentor and close friend. Corso's early works, such as 'The Vestal Lady on Brattle' (1955) and 'Gasoline' (1958), displayed his signature blend of streetwise wit, surreal imagery, and philosophical inquiry. His poetry, often performed in a rhythmic, incantatory style, became emblematic of the Beat movement’s challenge to social norms and literary conventions. Throughout his career, Corso published several influential collections, including 'The Happy Birthday of Death' and 'Mindfield,' and was celebrated for his directness and startling imagery.

Corso's legacy lies in his role as the youngest core member of the Beat Generation, alongside Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, and William S. Burroughs. His work influenced generations of poets and spoken word artists, and his life story—marked by hardship, rebellion, and creative fervor—remains a testament to the transformative power of poetry.
