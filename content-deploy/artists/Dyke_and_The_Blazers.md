## Biography
Dyke & The Blazers was a pioneering American funk band formed in 1965 in Phoenix, Arizona, led by Arlester "Dyke" Christian, a Buffalo, New York native. Christian began his musical journey playing bass in Carl LaRue and his Crew, a Buffalo-based band, before relocating to Phoenix where he joined forces with local musicians to create Dyke & The Blazers. Their early sound was heavily influenced by the innovations of James Brown’s band, blending riff-based improvisation, gritty guitar, jazzy horns, and Christian’s distinctive hoarse vocals into what became known as "gut-bucket funk."[1][7]

The group quickly gained local acclaim and recorded their breakout single "Funky Broadway" in 1966, notable for being the first charting record to use the word "funky" in its title. The song’s success propelled them onto the national stage, reaching No. 17 on the Billboard R&B chart and No. 65 on the pop chart. The original lineup dissolved in 1967, but Christian continued recording under the Dyke & The Blazers name, collaborating with top Los Angeles session musicians, including members of the Watts 103rd Street Rhythm Band. Their subsequent hits, such as "We Got More Soul" and "Let A Woman Be A Woman, Let A Man Be A Man," further cemented their reputation as funk innovators.[1][7]

Tragically, Arlester Christian’s career was cut short when he was fatally shot in 1971 at the age of 27. Despite this, Dyke & The Blazers' influence endured, with their music being sampled by hip-hop artists and covered by major soul acts. Their raw, energetic style helped lay the foundation for the funk genre and inspired generations of musicians.[1][5][7]
