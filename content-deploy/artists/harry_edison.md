## Biography
Harry 'Sweets' Edison, born on October 10, 1915, in Columbus, Ohio, to a Hopi Indian father and African-American mother, was raised by his aunt and uncle on a Kentucky farm after his parents separated. His uncle, a marching band musician, taught him music fundamentals on the family harmonium and introduced him to the cornet, sparking his passion. Self-taught and inspired by Louis Armstrong's sound on a Bessie Smith recording at age 12, Edison began playing locally in Columbus, then professionally with the Earl Hood band in high school and the Jeter-Pillars Orchestra from 1933-1935.[1][2][3][4][5]

In 1937, Edison moved to New York, briefly joining Lucky Millinder's band before becoming a key member of the Count Basie Orchestra, where saxophonist Lester Young nicknamed him 'Sweets' for his sweet trumpet tone. He stayed with Basie until 1950, contributing iconic solos and section work alongside Buck Clayton, Buddy Tate, Freddie Green, and Jo Jones, developing a unique clipped style influenced by Armstrong and Roy Eldridge. Post-Basie, he freelanced with Jazz at the Philharmonic, led his own quintet (featuring early Joe Williams), and worked with Buddy Rich and Louie Bellson, later settling on the West Coast as a premier studio musician.[1][2][4][5]

Edison's muted trumpet became legendary backing vocalists like Frank Sinatra with Nelson Riddle's orchestra, Billie Holiday, Nat King Cole, Ella Fitzgerald, and others in the 1950s-1970s, enhancing songs with subtle accents and mood-setting. He toured internationally, performed on film soundtracks and TV, served as Musical Director for Redd Foxx from 1973, and occasionally rejoined Basie until 1984. Known for his laconic wit, repeated single notes, and Harmon mute mastery, Edison died of prostate cancer on July 27, 1999, in Columbus at age 83, leaving a legacy as a swing-era icon and accompanist extraordinaire.[1][2][3][4][5]
