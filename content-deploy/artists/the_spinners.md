## Biography
The Spinners were formed in 1954 in Ferndale, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit, initially calling themselves The Domingoes—a name combining two groups they admired, The Dominos and The Flamingos.[1][2] The original lineup consisted of high school friends Henry Fambrough, Robert "Bobbie" Smith, Pervis Jackson, Billy Henderson, and C.P. Spencer, who performed doo-wop harmonies at local talent shows and small venues.[2][6] In 1956, Spencer departed and was replaced by George Dixon, and by 1961 the group had renamed themselves The Spinners, inspired by the spinning hubcaps of automobiles—a fitting tribute to their Motor City home.[2][5] Producer Harvey Fuqua signed the group to his Chicago-based Tri-Phi Records label, and when Fuqua sold the label to Berry Gordy's Motown Records in 1963, The Spinners became part of the legendary Motown family.[1][2] Under Motown's rigorous Artist Development program, they refined their choreography and vocal harmonies under mentors like Maxine Powell, Cholly Atkins, and Maurice King, though they struggled to achieve major commercial success during the 1960s despite scoring modest hits like "I'll Always Love You" (1965) and "Truly Yours" (1966).[2][4]

The group's breakthrough came with their 1970 hit "It's a Shame," co-written by Stevie Wonder, which gave them their first taste of significant success.[4][6] Recognizing their potential and aware that their Motown contract was expiring, Aretha Franklin persuaded them to sign with Atlantic Records in 1972-1973.[1][2] This pivotal move transformed their career trajectory. At Atlantic Records, working with producer Thom Bell, The Spinners epitomized the Philly soul sound with lush orchestral arrangements and intricate vocal harmonies, producing a string of hit songs including "The Rubberband Man," "I'll Be Around," and "Could It Be I'm Falling In Love."[1][2][3] The group achieved their greatest commercial success during the 1970s, becoming one of the greatest soul groups of that era and eventually being inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997.[2][3]

Despite numerous lineup changes over the decades—including the departure of original members Billy Henderson and Pervis Jackson, and the passing of longtime lead singer Bobbie Smith in 2013—The Spinners have demonstrated remarkable longevity and dedication to their craft.[6] With Henry Fambrough as the only surviving original member, the group continues to tour regularly to sold-out crowds worldwide, maintaining their legacy as influential figures in soul music history.[3][4] Their signature harmonic blend and iconic Cholly Atkins choreography remain defining characteristics of their enduring appeal.

## Fun Facts

- The Spinners underwent Motown's famously rigorous in-house Artist Development program, the same training regimen that shaped other Motown legends, which included instruction in choreography, vocal harmony, and stage presence.[4]
- Aretha Franklin played a crucial role in The Spinners' career breakthrough by persuading them to leave Motown Records for Atlantic Records in 1972-1973, a decision that ultimately led to their greatest commercial success.[1][2]
- The group's original name 'The Domingoes' was a creative mash-up combining the names of two groups they admired—The Dominos and The Flamingos—reflecting their deep roots in doo-wop and R&B traditions.[2]
