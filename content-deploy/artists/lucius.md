## Biography
Lucius is an acclaimed American indie pop band formed by lead vocalists and songwriters Jess Wolfe and Holly Laessig, who met while attending Berklee College of Music in the mid-2000s. After relocating to Brooklyn’s Ditmas Park in 2007, they established a collaborative musical community, eventually forming the core lineup with multi-instrumentalists Dan Molad and Peter Lalish. The band’s debut album, 'Wildewoman' (2013), received critical praise for its inventive blend of 1960s girl group harmonies and modern pop sensibilities, with Rolling Stone calling it 'fresh and thrilling.'

Lucius continued to evolve their sound with subsequent albums, including 'Good Grief' (2016) and the 1980s dance-influenced 'Second Nature' (2022), the latter produced by Brandi Carlile and Dave Cobb. Their music is characterized by lush vocal harmonies, art-pop arrangements, and a visually distinctive stage presence. Over more than a decade, Lucius has built a passionate global following through their energetic live shows and inventive songwriting, while Wolfe and Laessig have become sought-after collaborators in the music industry.

Beyond their own records, Wolfe and Laessig have contributed vocals to a wide range of artists, from Brandi Carlile and The War on Drugs to Harry Styles and John Legend. Their influence is felt both through their recordings and their participation in projects like Joni Mitchell’s 'Joni Jam.' Lucius’s legacy is defined by their genre-blending artistry, collaborative spirit, and the enduring partnership at the band’s core.
