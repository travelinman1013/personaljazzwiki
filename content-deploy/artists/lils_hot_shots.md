## Biography
Lil's Hot Shots was not a standalone musical artist or group, but rather a recording pseudonym used for sessions by Louis Armstrong and his Hot Five, with Lil Hardin Armstrong as a key member and bandleader[5]. The name 'Lil's Hot Shots' appeared on Vocalion label releases in the 1920s, reflecting the ensemble's roots in early jazz and ragtime, and highlighting Lil Hardin Armstrong's pivotal role in shaping the sound and direction of the band. Lil Hardin Armstrong, born in Memphis in 1898, was a pioneering jazz pianist, composer, arranger, singer, and bandleader[4]. She studied music formally, attending Mrs. Hook’s School of Music and Fisk University, before moving to Chicago where she became a central figure in the burgeoning jazz scene[1][4]. As 'Hot Miss Lil,' she was one of the few women to play as a regular member of jazz ensembles, and her energetic piano style and leadership helped define the sound of Louis Armstrong’s Hot Five and Hot Seven recordings[2][3].

Her musical style blended ragtime, blues, and early jazz, characterized by rhythmic drive, inventive harmonies, and expressive improvisation[4]. Lil Hardin Armstrong contributed several classic compositions to the jazz canon, including 'Struttin’ with Some Barbecue' and 'Just for a Thrill,' and she was instrumental in launching Louis Armstrong’s solo career, both musically and as a promoter[1][4]. The legacy of Lil's Hot Shots lies in their foundational recordings, which helped establish the vocabulary of jazz and showcased the talents of Armstrong, Hardin, and their collaborators. Lil Hardin Armstrong’s influence extended beyond her work with Armstrong, as she led her own bands, composed prolifically, and mentored younger musicians, leaving an indelible mark on American music[1][4][6].
