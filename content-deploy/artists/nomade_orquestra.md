## Biography
Nomade Orquestra is a ten-piece instrumental band formed in 2012 in the ABC region of Greater São Paulo, Brazil, an industrial belt on the outskirts of the city that has long been a crucible for grassroots culture and independent music. Drawing on the diverse musical tastes of its members, the group quickly developed a cosmopolitan sound that treats São Paulo’s urban landscape as a meeting point for global grooves, blending local Brazilian traditions with styles from across the African diaspora and beyond. Their first, self-titled album was released domestically in 2014 and then internationally via Far Out Recordings, which helped carry the band from playing in local venues to appearing on festival stages and gaining attention from international tastemakers, specialist jazz and world-music media, and vinyl collectors.

Over the following years Nomade Orquestra expanded on this foundation with albums such as "EntreMundos" (2017), whose title encapsulates their aim of operating "between worlds" stylistically and conceptually, and later projects that continued to emphasize cinematic arrangements, heavy grooves, and political or spiritual subtexts. Their music is anchored in jazz but freely incorporates funk, Afrobeat, Ethio-jazz, reggae, dub, hip hop, rock, and library-music atmospheres, often stitched together with horn-driven themes, intricate percussion, and psychedelic keyboards. Critics frequently highlight the band’s ability to be both experimental and accessible, describing their records as wordless narratives or soundtracks that evoke everything from São Paulo’s bustling streets to speculative, cosmic landscapes, while still working effectively on dancefloors.

Although still relatively contemporary in the broader history of Brazilian music, Nomade Orquestra has already carved out a recognizable niche within the country’s jazz and groove scene, standing alongside other modern large-ensemble projects that fuse Afro-diasporic rhythms with global influences. Their work has contributed to renewed international interest in Brazilian instrumental music that exists outside of classic bossa nova and MPB canons, showing how younger generations reinterpret that heritage through a global and often more explicitly political lens. As touring and recording continue, the group’s legacy centers on its role as a boundary-crossing ensemble that treats Brazil not as an isolated tradition but as one node in a wider, constantly evolving musical network.

## Fun Facts

- Critics often liken their stylistic range and horn-driven grooves to bands such as The Souljazz Orchestra, Antibalas, and Bixiga 70, placing them in a global lineage of contemporary Afrobeat- and jazz-influenced big bands.
