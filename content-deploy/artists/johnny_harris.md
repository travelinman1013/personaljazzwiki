## Biography
Johnny Harris (1932–2020) was a Scottish composer, arranger, conductor, and producer whose career spanned over six decades and bridged the worlds of pop, jazz, funk, and film music. Born in Edinburgh to Welsh parents, Harris was a graduate of the Guildhall School of Music in London, where he honed his skills as a trumpeter and pianist. He began his professional journey in the 1950s, playing trumpet with prominent English big bands before moving into arranging and conducting roles in the early 1960s.

Harris's reputation grew rapidly as he worked with leading artists such as Tom Jones, Petula Clark, Shirley Bassey, Lulu, and Nancy Sinatra. He became known for his dynamic, sometimes acrobatic conducting style and his innovative arrangements, which often blended lush orchestration with contemporary jazz-funk elements. His breakthrough as a solo artist came with the 1970 album 'Movements,' a cult classic noted for its inventive use of brass, woodwinds, and early synthesizers. Harris also composed scores for British and American film and television, including 'Fragment of Fear,' 'Wonder Woman,' and 'Buck Rogers in the 25th Century.' In 1972, he relocated to the United States, where he continued to work with major stars and produce music for television until his death in 2020.

Harris's legacy lies in his versatility and his ability to bridge genres, leaving a lasting mark on both the British and American music scenes. His arrangements and productions are celebrated for their sophistication and energy, influencing generations of arrangers and producers in pop, jazz, and soundtrack music.
