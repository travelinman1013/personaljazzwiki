## Biography
Clarence George Carter (born January 14, 1936, in Montgomery, Alabama) is an American soul, blues, and R&B singer, songwriter, musician, and producer whose earthy baritone and often sexually charged storytelling made him a distinctive voice of Southern soul.[2][1][6] Blind from birth, he was encouraged into music early; his grandmother gave him his first guitar at age nine, and he later studied music at Alabama State College (now Alabama State University), where he learned guitar, voice, and classical techniques and even wrote and arranged charts in Braille.[1][3][4] In the early 1960s he teamed with fellow blind singer Calvin Scott as Clarence & Calvin (later the C & C Boys), cutting regional singles for Fairlane and Duke Records before recording at Rick Hall’s FAME Studios in Muscle Shoals, a connection that would anchor his classic work.[1][2][3]

After a car accident sidelined Scott in 1966, Carter went solo, signing to FAME and scoring his first chart entry with “Tell Daddy,” which reached No. 35 on the Billboard R&B chart and later became Etta James’s hit “Tell Mama,” for which he was credited as writer.[1][2][3] Moving to Atlantic Records at the end of 1967, he began a run of late‑1960s and early‑1970s hits that defined his legacy: “Slip Away” (1968), “Too Weak to Fight” (1968), “Snatching It Back,” “Back Door Santa,” “The Feeling Is Right,” and especially “Patches” (1970), which sold over a million copies, hit the Top 5 pop charts in the US and UK, earned a gold disc, and won the Grammy Award for Best R&B Song in 1971.[1][2][3] His records from this period, often cut at FAME with the Muscle Shoals rhythm section and guests like Duane Allman, showcased a country‑tinged R&B style, blending blues phrasing, gospel intensity, and conversational narratives of cheating, lust, and hardship.[1][3][4] In the 1980s he refreshed his sound with synthesizers and scored a new cult classic with the comically raunchy “Strokin’” (1986), securing his reputation as both a deep‑soul stylist and an unabashed chronicler of adult themes; his songs have since appeared in numerous films and television shows, and he is widely regarded as one of the great Southern soul voices to emerge from Alabama and the Muscle Shoals scene.[1][2]

Carter’s work forms a link between older acoustic country blues traditions—especially the lineage of blind blues guitarists—and modern soul, and his baritone delivery and lyrical focus on unvarnished adult relationships have influenced later Southern soul and contemporary blues performers.[4][1] He earned three gold records for “Patches,” “Too Weak to Fight,” and “Slip Away,” released more than thirty albums, and continued recording into the late twentieth century on labels such as Ichiban, adapting to changing production styles while maintaining his core identity as a storyteller of working‑class Southern life.[1][3][2] His personal life intersected with his career when he toured with a full band and backup singers around 1970; one singer, Alabama soul artist Candi Staton, became his wife for several years, further rooting him in the Southern gospel‑soul community.[1] Across decades, Carter’s blend of blues, soul, and country elements, along with his frank, often humorous treatment of love and sex, has left a lasting imprint on the sound and reputation of Muscle Shoals–era soul music.[1][3][2]

## Fun Facts
- Clarence Carter was born blind and learned to write and arrange music in Braille, a skill he used professionally on his own recording sessions.[1][4]
- His 1967 FAME single “Tell Daddy” directly inspired Etta James’s classic “Tell Mama,” one of her best‑known songs, for which Carter received songwriting credit.[1][2][3]
- Carter’s holiday‑adjacent track “Back Door Santa” features a horn break later sampled by Run‑DMC for their hit “Christmas in Hollis,” connecting his 1960s soul work to 1980s hip‑hop.[3]
- He earned three gold records for “Slip Away,” “Too Weak to Fight,” and “Patches,” with “Patches” selling over a million copies in about three days and winning the 1971 Grammy Award for Best R&B Song.[1][3][2]

## Musical Connections

### Mentors/Influences
- [[rick_hall|Rick Hall]] - Owner of FAME Studios who mentored Carter (and his partner Calvin Scott) after hearing them rehearse, helping him shape his distinctive sound and singing style within the Muscle Shoals studio environment. (Early recordings at FAME including “Tell Daddy,” “Thread the Needle,” and sessions leading into “Slip Away” and other Atlantic‑era hits tracked at FAME.) [Mid‑1960s to early 1970s]

### Key Collaborators
- [[calvin_scott|Calvin Scott]] - Fellow blind singer and early partner; together they performed in clubs and recorded as Clarence & Calvin and later the C & C Boys before Scott’s serious car accident ended the duo’s run. (Singles for Fairlane Records (e.g., “I Wanna Dance But I Don’t Know How”) and Duke Records as the C & C Boys; early FAME/Atco single “Step by Step.”) [Early 1960s–1966[1][2]]
- [[fame_studios__muscle_shoals_rhythm_section|FAME Studios / Muscle Shoals rhythm section]] - House musicians and production team at FAME Studios who backed Carter on many of his classic hits, giving his records their signature Southern soul groove. (“Tell Daddy,” “Slip Away,” “Too Weak to Fight,” “Snatching It Back,” “Back Door Santa,” “Making Love (At The Dark End Of The Street),” “Patches.”) [Mid‑1960s to early 1970s[1][3]]
- [[spooner_oldham|Spooner Oldham]] - Keyboardist from the Muscle Shoals scene who played on key Carter recordings. (Featured on keyboards on the hit single “Slip Away” from the album “This Is Clarence Carter.”) [Late 1960s[3]]
- [[duane_allman|Duane Allman]] - Guitarist (later of the Allman Brothers Band) who contributed guitar work to Carter’s sessions at FAME. (Guitar on tracks from the album “The Dynamic Clarence Carter,” including hit single “Too Weak to Fight.”) [Late 1960s[3]]
- [[candi_staton|Candi Staton]] - Soul and gospel singer who toured as one of Carter’s backup singers and later became his wife; they shared stages during his peak touring years. (National tours with Carter’s live band following his Atlantic hits such as “Slip Away” and “Patches.”) [Circa 1969–early 1970s (married 1970–1973)[1]]

### Artists Influenced
- [[etta_james|Etta James]] - Recorded “Tell Mama,” an answer record to Carter’s “Tell Daddy,” using his song as the foundation for one of her signature hits, helping carry his songwriting into a broader soul canon. (“Tell Mama” (1967), based on Carter’s “Tell Daddy,” for which he is credited as writer.) [Late 1960s[1][2][3]]
- [[rundmc|Run‑DMC]] - Sampled the horn break from Carter’s “Back Door Santa,” bringing his work into hip‑hop and holiday pop culture. (“Christmas in Hollis” (1987), which uses the distinctive horn break from “Back Door Santa.”) [1980s[3]]
- [[later_southern_soul_and_contemporary_blues_singers|Later Southern soul and contemporary blues singers]] - Carter is cited as an exemplar of the Southern soul tradition and as the “final link” in a lineage of blind blues singer‑guitarists, influencing subsequent artists who blend country blues inflections with modern soul. (Influence evident in later Southern soul recordings that echo his country‑blues‑meets‑soul vocal style and adult‑themed narratives.) [1970s onward[4][1]]
