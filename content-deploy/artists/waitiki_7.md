## Biography
The WAITIKI 7 is a modern exotica ensemble founded in 2008 by Hawaiʻi-born musicians Randy Wong and Abe Lagrimas Jr. while they were studying in Boston—Wong at the New England Conservatory and Lagrimas at Berklee College of Music. Their collaboration began as a way to reconnect with their Hawaiian roots, experimenting with various musical concepts before settling on exotica, a genre that blends jazz, tropical rhythms, and global influences. The group expanded from its original quartet to a septet, drawing on the talents of conservatory-trained musicians, including Grammy winners and symphony performers, to create a lush, immersive sound that honors and redefines exotica for contemporary audiences.[2][3][1]

Rooted in the golden age of Waikiki and inspired by pioneers like Martin Denny and Arthur Lyman, The WAITIKI 7 has become a leading force in the exotica revival. Their music is characterized by intricate percussion, vibrant mallet instruments, jazz improvisation, and evocative soundscapes that transport listeners to imagined tropical locales. The band has released several acclaimed albums, such as 'Adventures in Paradise,' 'New Sounds of Exotica,' and 'Exotica Reborn,' and has performed internationally, including at Germany's Festival Wassermusik and major tiki festivals in the United States. Their commitment to the genre includes both preserving classic exotica repertoire and composing new works, often collaborating with other artists and orchestras to expand the genre's reach.[2][3][5][1]

The WAITIKI 7 is recognized not only for their musical excellence but also for their efforts to legitimize exotica as an art form, moving it beyond its kitschy reputation to highlight its cultural and artistic significance. Their performances, including recent sold-out shows in Waikiki and collaborations with the Hawaii Youth Symphony, have helped raise the profile of exotica and support music education. The band continues to inspire new generations of musicians and listeners, ensuring that the mesmerizing rhythms and vibrant spirit of exotica remain a vital part of Hawaii's musical heritage.[3][5][2]
