## Biography
Jessie Mae Hemphill (October 18, 1923 – July 22, 2006) was a pioneering American electric guitarist, songwriter, and vocalist who became a central figure in the North Mississippi hill country blues tradition. Born near Como and Senatobia, Mississippi, Hemphill was immersed in a musical family lineage that included her grandfather Sid Hemphill, a renowned multi-instrumentalist who recorded for folklorist Alan Lomax. She began playing guitar at age seven and participated in local fife-and-drum bands, learning drums and guitar from family members and performing at community picnics and gatherings[5][1][3].

Although Hemphill played semi-professionally in Memphis during the 1950s and 1960s, her career did not gain significant momentum until the late 1970s, when she was recorded by ethnomusicologist David Evans and began releasing albums through High Water Recording Company. Her music is characterized by strong, repetitive dance rhythms—a style she called the "hypnotic boogie"—and minimal harmonic variation, rooted deeply in the hill country blues tradition. She often accompanied herself with a tambourine tied to her foot, creating a distinctive one-woman-band sound[5][4][3].

Hemphill's legacy is marked by her role as one of the few female blues artists to achieve international recognition in the genre. She performed across the United States and Europe, won multiple W.C. Handy Blues Awards, and inspired a new generation of musicians interested in the raw, rhythmic power of hill country blues. Despite a stroke in 1993 that limited her ability to play guitar, she continued to contribute to music through vocals and percussion, cementing her status as a foundational figure in American blues[5][1].
