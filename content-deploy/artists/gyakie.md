## Biography
Gyakie, born Jackline Acheampong on December 16, 1999, in Kumasi, Ashanti Region, Ghana, grew up immersed in music thanks to her family's rich musical heritage—her father is Nana Acheampong, a renowned Ghanaian highlife musician[3][5]. From the age of eight, she accompanied her father to the studio, absorbing the creative process and nurturing her passion for African music genres[1][5]. She attended T.I. Ahmadiyya Senior High School and later majored in International Business at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, balancing her academic pursuits with her burgeoning music career[1][5].

Gyakie officially launched her career in 2019 with the single "Love is Pretty," quickly following up with "Never Like This"—both tracks showcased her ability to blend English and native languages, and her soulful, emotive approach to songwriting[3][4][5]. Her breakthrough came in 2020 with "Forever," from her debut EP 'Seed,' which topped charts across Ghana, Nigeria, and Kenya, and led to a high-profile remix with Nigerian artist Omah Lay[3][5][6]. Gyakie's style is characterized by a fusion of afrobeats, afro soul, afro R&B, and hiplife, marked by soothing vocals and heartfelt lyrics that bridge traditional and contemporary African sounds[1][3][5].

Her rapid ascent has earned her international recognition, including record deals with Sony Music, RCA Records UK, and Sony Music Africa, and awards such as Woman of the Year at the 3Music Awards in 2022[5]. Gyakie continues to inspire a new generation of African artists, solidifying her legacy as one of the continent's most promising voices in afrobeats and afro-fusion[3][5].
