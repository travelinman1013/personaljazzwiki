## Biography
King Louie One Man Band was a solo project founded by Louis Paul Bankston (December 18, 1972 – February 12, 2022) at the dawn of the new century, around 1999. Bankston, an American rock and roll musician from New Orleans, created this unique one-man operation after abandoning traditional garage rock in 1998 to explore Louisiana swamp pop, boogie woogie, boogie rock, and power pop. In the King Louie One Man Band, Bankston performed as a multi-instrumentalist, singing while playing drums, guitar, cowbell, and harmonica, creating a distinctive sound that was both jokey and hard-to-define. The project released several 7-inch records on various independent labels and put out a full-length LP on Goner Records in 2004.

The King Louie One Man Band became one of Bankston's most beloved and well-known projects, characterized by raw, jangly arrangements and a goofy sense of humor that reflected his creative energy and prolific output. Performances were unpredictable affairs where audiences never quite knew what they would experience, as Bankston's racing creative engine drove each show in different directions. This solo venture represented a departure from his earlier work with bands like the Royal Pendletons, The Persuaders, and The Exploding Hearts, allowing him to explore a more personal and experimental approach to music-making.

Bankston's career was marked by remarkable resilience despite struggles with substance use and health issues. He remained deeply connected to the New Orleans music community and continued creating music across multiple projects throughout his life. The King Louie One Man Band exemplified his philosophy that all music was ultimately just music, regardless of genre boundaries. Bankston passed away on February 12, 2022, leaving behind a legacy of 53 vinyl records and a profound impact on the garage rock and power pop communities across New Orleans, Portland, and Memphis.
