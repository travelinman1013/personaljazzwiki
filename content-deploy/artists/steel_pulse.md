## Biography
Steel Pulse is a pioneering British roots reggae band formed in 1975 in the Handsworth area of Birmingham, England, by schoolmates David Hinds (lead singer, guitarist, and primary songwriter) and Basil Gabbidon, later joined by Ronnie 'Stepper' McQueen (bass)[1][2][3]. The members, children of West Indian immigrants, were inspired by the sounds and social messages of Bob Marley and the Wailers, as well as other Jamaican artists like Burning Spear[1][2][3]. Steel Pulse quickly became known for their uncompromising social commentary, addressing issues of racism and the Black British experience through the lens of Rastafarianism, and for their musical intricacy blending reggae with jazz, Latin, ska, and even punk influences[1][2][3][4].

Initially, the band faced resistance from local Caribbean venues due to their Rastafarian beliefs, but they found acceptance in the burgeoning punk scene, aligning themselves with the Rock Against Racism movement and opening for punk acts such as The Stranglers and The Clash[1][2][4]. Their debut album, 'Handsworth Revolution' (1978), is widely regarded as a landmark in British reggae, combining roots reggae with elements of punk and ska, and featuring enduring tracks like 'Ku Klux Klan,' which tackled the horrors of racism[1][2][3][4]. Steel Pulse continued to evolve musically, releasing a trilogy of influential albums on Island Records before moving to Elektra, where they produced the Grammy-winning 'Babylon the Bandit' (1986)[2][3].

Steel Pulse's legacy is marked by their role as one of the first international reggae bands to fuse African, salsa, and calypso beats with pop and rock, and by their commitment to social justice and activism[4][5]. Their innovative sound and powerful messages have earned them a substantial global audience and enduring respect among both reggae and punk communities. They remain active, revered by younger generations of artists, and continue to perform worldwide[5].
