## Biography
Lonnie Johnson was a pioneering American blues and jazz musician, renowned for his innovative guitar techniques and expressive vocal style. Born Alonzo Johnson on February 8, 1889, in New Orleans, Louisiana, he grew up in a large, musically gifted family—his father led a string band, and all his siblings played instruments. Johnson began performing as a violinist and guitarist in the brothels and cabarets of New Orleans' Storyville district as a teenager, later touring Europe with a musical revue in 1917. Upon returning, he suffered the tragic loss of most of his family to the 1918 influenza epidemic, prompting a move to St. Louis, where he quickly became a leading figure in the local blues scene.

Johnson's breakthrough came after winning a talent contest in 1925, which led to a contract with OKeh Records. Over the next decades, he recorded prolifically—over 130 titles for OKeh alone—and collaborated with jazz and blues luminaries such as Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, and Victoria Spivey. Johnson was a trailblazer in developing the single-string guitar solo, elevating the guitar's status in blues and jazz and directly influencing the evolution of modern electric blues and rock guitar. Despite periods of obscurity and working outside music, he enjoyed a late-career revival during the 1960s blues resurgence, recording and performing until his death in Toronto, Canada, on June 16, 1970.

Johnson’s legacy is immense: his sophisticated, jazz-inflected urban blues style bridged early blues and jazz, and his technical innovations shaped generations of guitarists. His best-known songs, such as “Tomorrow Night,” remain standards, and his influence can be heard in the work of countless blues, jazz, and rock musicians.
