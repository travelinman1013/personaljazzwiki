## Biography
Rainbow Girls is an eclectic folk-rock trio originating from California, United States, composed of Erin Chapin, Caitlin Gowdey, and Vanessa May (also known as Vanessa Wilbourn)[1][2]. The group formed in 2010 while attending the University of California at Santa Barbara, initially gathering at an underground open mic night called 'Bean Night' in Isla Vista, and bonding as residents of the Rainbow House dorm[2][3]. The band began as a larger collective of women musicians before evolving into a trio, united by their desire to create music collaboratively in a scene often dominated by male performers[2][3].

Rainbow Girls developed their sound through grassroots touring, busking at farmers markets and local venues across California, and spending several summers busking and couch-surfing throughout Europe[1][2][3]. Their music blends folk, Americana, indie, rock and roll, and a cappella, characterized by rich harmonies and multi-instrumental performances—members switch between guitar, ukulele, accordion, banjo, and more[1][2]. Their debut album, 'The Sound of Light,' was crowdfunded and released in 2013, followed by 'Perceptronium' (2015), 'American Dream' (2017), and the cover album 'Give the People What They Want' (2019)[2]. A viral 2018 video of their cover of Alvin Robinson’s 'Down Home Girl' brought them widespread attention and professional management[2][3].

Known for their authentic, independent approach and dynamic live shows, Rainbow Girls emphasize connection, community, and social awareness in their songwriting[2][3][4]. Their legacy is marked by a commitment to grassroots touring, organizing all-female lineups at major venues, and fostering creative collaboration among women musicians[5]. They continue to tour extensively in the US and Europe, maintaining a strong reputation for their soulful harmonies and genre-blending style.
