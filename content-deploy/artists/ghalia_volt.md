## Biography
Ghalia Volt, born Ghalia Vauthier in Brussels, Belgium, is a dynamic blues rock singer, guitarist, drummer, and songwriter who has become a notable force in the modern blues scene. Her musical journey began with busking on the streets of Brussels, where she developed her craft and deepened her love for the blues. She first fronted the rhythm and blues group Ghalia & The Naphtalines, and later joined Voodoo Casino, recording her first album in 2016. Driven by a desire to immerse herself in the roots of blues, Volt traveled to the United States in 2013, busking and performing in iconic cities such as Chicago, St. Louis, Memphis, and Nashville, before settling into the Deep South. Her regular performances in Clarksdale, Mississippi, and appearances at the Sunflower River Blues & Gospel Festival cemented her reputation as a passionate and authentic blues artist.

Volt’s career took a significant leap after she connected with the New Orleans-based band Johnny Mastro & Mama's Boys, resulting in the acclaimed album 'Let the Demons Out' (2017). This collaboration helped establish her presence in the U.S. blues scene. Her subsequent album, 'Mississippi Blend' (2019), recorded with Southern blues greats like Cody Dickinson, Cedric Burnside, Lightnin’ Malcolm, and Watermelon Slim, reached the Top 3 on the Billboard Blues Albums Chart and showcased her ability to blend European roots with American blues traditions. During the pandemic, Volt reinvented herself as a one-woman band, writing and performing solo material—including the album 'One Woman Band'—while traveling across America by train. Her latest album, 'Shout Sister Shout!', was recorded at the legendary Rancho De La Luna studio in Joshua Tree, California, and has been praised for its raw energy and empowering themes.

Volt’s musical style is characterized by a fusion of blues rock, hill country blues, and modern blues, marked by gritty guitar work, soulful vocals, and a fearless, independent spirit. Her journey from Brussels busker to an internationally recognized blues artist highlights her dedication to authenticity and her role as a bridge between European and American blues traditions.
