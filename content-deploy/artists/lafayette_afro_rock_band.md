## Biography
Lafayette Afro Rock Band was an American funk group formed in Roosevelt, Long Island, New York in 1970. Initially known as the Bobby Boyd Congress, the band was led by vocalist Bobby Boyd and included members such as guitarist Larry Jones, bassist Lafayette Hudson, keyboardist Frank Abel, horn players Ronnie James Buttacavoli and Arthur Young, drummer Ernest 'Donny' Donable, and percussionists Keno Speller and Arthur Young. Facing a saturated funk scene in the United States, the group relocated to Paris, France in 1971, where Boyd soon departed and the remaining members briefly became Soul Congress before settling on the name Ice, and later, Lafayette Afro Rock Band. 

In Paris, the band became the house session group at producer Pierre Jaubert's Parisound studio and absorbed the vibrant African and North African musical influences of the Barbès district. Their sound evolved to blend American funk with African rhythms, textures, and rock elements. Under the Lafayette Afro Rock Band name, they released influential albums such as 'Soul Makossa' (1973) and 'Malik' (1974), featuring tracks like 'Hihache' and 'Darkest Light.' Although they received little recognition in the U.S. during their active years, their music later became a vital source of breakbeats and samples for hip-hop and pop artists, cementing their legacy as a foundational group in the evolution of funk and sampled music. The band disbanded after returning to America in 1978.
