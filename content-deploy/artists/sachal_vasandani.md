## Biography
Sachal Vasandani, a native of Chicago, Illinois, grew up in a musically rich household exposed to a diverse array of genres including The Beatles, Michael Jackson, classical music, Indian classical music, and jazz. He pursued formal education at the University of Michigan, graduating in 2000 with degrees in jazz music, classical music, and economics. There, he honed his skills studying with operatic tenors and baritones, including the first African American tenor to sing at the Metropolitan Opera, while absorbing jazz and Motown influences in the Detroit-Ann Arbor area. His talent emerged early, earning him Down Beat magazine's Collegiate Jazz Vocalist of the Year award in 1999.[1][2][3][4]

After moving to New York, Vasandani quickly integrated into the jazz scene, working with luminaries like Wynton Marsalis and the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra. He debuted with *Eyes Wide Open* on Mack Avenue Records in 2007, followed by *We Move* (2009), a New York Times Critics’ Pick, and *Hi-Fly* (2011), which hit #1 on iTunes Jazz charts and was produced by John Clayton featuring Jon Hendricks. Later releases include *Slow Motion Miracles* (2015, produced by Michael Leonhart for Sony/OKeh) showcasing original compositions blending jazz with pop, *Shadow Train* (2018), and *Best Life Now* produced by Nate Smith, fusing pop songwriting, R&B grooves, and jazz textures. His style is rooted in jazz and classical traditions, marked by a singular voice, unique phrasing, soulful improvisation across lyrics, melodies, and rhythms, with swagger for big bands and vulnerability for ballads, establishing him as one of the eminent vocal improvisers of his generation.[1][2][3][4][5][6]

Vasandani has performed worldwide at major festivals, theaters, and clubs, collaborating across genres and serving as an in-demand lyricist and composer. His legacy includes a discography blending tradition and innovation, Grammy-nominated features, and a reputation for magnetic artistry bridging jazz with contemporary sounds.[2][3][5][6][8]
