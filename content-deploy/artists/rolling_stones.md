## Biography
The Rolling Stones, a British rock band formed in London in 1962, originated from the chance reunion of childhood friends Mick Jagger and Keith Richards at a Dartford train station in 1961, where they bonded over shared blues records by artists like Chuck Berry and Muddy Waters[2][3][4]. Jagger and Richards soon joined multi-instrumentalist Brian Jones at the Ealing Club, performing with Alexis Korner's Blues Incorporated, before Jones assembled them into his own blues-based band, adding Ian Stewart on keyboards and initially Mick Taylor on bass; the group debuted as 'the Rollin' Stones' on July 12, 1962, at London's Marquee Club, naming themselves after Muddy Waters' track 'Rollin' Stone'[1][2][6]. By early 1963, Bill Wyman joined on bass and Charlie Watts on drums, solidifying the classic early lineup, as they honed their raw Chicago blues style in gritty London clubs amid financial struggles[1][2][3].

Under manager Andrew Loog Oldham, who signed them in 1963, the Stones exploded during the British Invasion, initially covering American R&B but soon crafting Jagger-Richards originals like '(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction,' blending blues, rock 'n' roll, and a rebellious edge that contrasted the Beatles' pop polish[4][5][6]. Their sound evolved through psychedelic experiments in the mid-1960s before returning to blues roots, peaking in the late 1960s and early 1970s with albums like *Aftermath* (their first all-originals) amid lineup shifts: Brian Jones was ousted in 1969 and died shortly after, replaced by Mick Taylor, who later exited for Ronnie Wood in 1975[1][4][5]. Known for their dark countercultural vision, the band achieved massive success with hits like 'Paint It Black' and enduring tours[4][6].

Today, with Jagger, Richards, and Wood as core members—following Charlie Watts' death in 2021—the Stones remain rock's longest-running act, celebrating 60+ years with vitality, as seen in their 2023 tour and album *Hackney Diamonds*, their first original studio release in 18 years, cementing a legacy of innovation, excess, and blues-driven defiance[1][2].
