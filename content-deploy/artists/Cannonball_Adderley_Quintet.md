## Biography
The Cannonball Adderley Quintet was founded by alto saxophonist Julian "Cannonball" Adderley and his brother Nat Adderley (cornet) in the late 1950s, following Cannonball's early success as a band director and his explosive debut in New York's jazz scene[8]. After a brief stint with Miles Davis, where Cannonball contributed to landmark albums like 'Milestones' and 'Kind of Blue,' he reformed the quintet in 1959, quickly achieving acclaim with their live recording of Bobby Timmons's 'This Here' at San Francisco’s Jazz Workshop[2][5][8]. The group became a leading force in soul jazz, blending hard bop, bebop, and gospel-infused grooves, and was celebrated for its energetic performances and Cannonball's engaging, educational stage presence[4][8].

Throughout its existence, the quintet featured a rotating cast of top-tier jazz musicians, including pianists Joe Zawinul, Bobby Timmons, Victor Feldman, and George Duke, and drummers like Louis Hayes and Roy McCurdy[2][5][8]. The band's repertoire included hits such as Zawinul's 'Mercy, Mercy, Mercy,' Nat Adderley's 'Work Song,' and 'Jive Samba.' Cannonball's openness to new sounds and his role as a talent scout helped launch the careers of several notable artists. The quintet's style evolved with the times, incorporating elements of soul, funk, and electronics, but always maintained a strong melodic and rhythmic foundation[2][8].

The Cannonball Adderley Quintet is remembered as one of the most popular and influential jazz groups of the 1960s and early 1970s. Their music bridged the gap between jazz and popular audiences, introducing soul jazz to a wider public and leaving a lasting legacy through both their recordings and the musicians they inspired and mentored[4][8].
