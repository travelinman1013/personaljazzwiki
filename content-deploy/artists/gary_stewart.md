## Biography
Gary Stewart (May 28, 1944 – December 16, 2003) was an American singer, songwriter, and musician celebrated for his emotionally charged vibrato voice and his unique blend of honky tonk, outlaw country, and southern rock. Born in Dunham, Kentucky, to a coal miner father and Avon lady mother, Stewart moved with his family to Fort Pierce, Florida, after his father was injured in a mining accident. Early exposure to both Appalachian and Southern musical traditions deeply influenced his style, and by his teens, Stewart was already performing in local bands and writing songs.

Stewart's career began to take shape in the 1960s when he started traveling to Nashville and co-writing hits for other artists, including Stonewall Jackson and Billy Walker. After a period of disillusionment with the Nashville music scene, Stewart returned to Florida, where he fused country, rock, and blues into a raw, electrifying honky tonk sound. His breakthrough came in the mid-1970s with a string of hits, most notably the chart-topping 'She’s Actin’ Single (I’m Drinkin’ Doubles).' Stewart's music, marked by anguished lyrics and a hard-edged delivery, earned him a devoted following and the title 'King of Honky-Tonks.'

Throughout his career, Stewart collaborated with a range of artists and maintained a fiercely independent spirit, preferring intimate venues over mainstream stardom. His influence extended to both peers and later generations of country musicians, and his legacy endures as a pioneer who brought grit and authenticity to modern honky tonk and outlaw country. Stewart died in 2003, shortly after the passing of his wife, leaving behind a body of work revered for its honesty and emotional depth.
