## Biography
Horace Swaby, professionally known as Augustus Pablo, was born on June 21, 1954, in Saint Andrew, Jamaica, into a comfortable middle-class family—his father was a prominent lawyer of Indian extraction. Unlike many of his reggae contemporaries, Pablo came from privileged circumstances and received formal musical training at Kingston College School, where he learned organ. His transformative encounter with the melodica came when an unnamed girl lent him the instrument during his school years. Fascinated by its potential, Pablo became obsessed with mastering the melodica, an instrument previously relegated to teaching children in Jamaican public schools. He would go on to revolutionize its use in popular music, earning the title "the melodica king" and becoming perhaps the first person to establish it as a viable professional instrument in reggae and dub music.

Pablo's recording career began in the early 1970s when he recorded "Iggy Iggy" at Aquarius Records, adopting his stage name for this release. His breakthrough came with the 1972 instrumental "Java," recorded with producer Clive Chin, which became a massive hit and launched his solo career. Throughout the mid-to-late 1970s, Pablo established himself as both a prolific recording artist and visionary producer. He founded multiple record labels—Hot Stuff, Message, and most notably Rockers (named after his brother's soundsystem)—and released a steady stream of acclaimed instrumentals and produced hits for numerous artists. His seminal 1974 album "This Is Augustus Pablo" and his groundbreaking 1975 collaboration with King Tubby, "Ital Dub," helped establish dub as a mainstream reggae subgenre. His 1978 masterpiece "East of the River Nile" blended East Asian and Jamaican sounds into a unique sonic landscape that became iconic in reggae history.

By the 1980s, Pablo's commercial prominence declined as musical tastes shifted from roots reggae toward dancehall, though he maintained a dedicated international following and continued touring extensively. He made a notable comeback in 1986 with the album "Rising Sun" and continued producing and performing throughout the 1990s, working with artists like Dawn Penn and Yami Bolo. Augustus Pablo died on May 18, 1999, at age 44, leaving behind an immense legacy as one of the architects of modern reggae and dub music. His innovative use of the melodica, his production acumen, and his role in developing dub music's sonic possibilities continue to influence musicians globally.
