## Biography
Mamie Smith, born on May 26, 1883, in Cincinnati, Ohio, was a pioneering African American singer and vaudeville performer. She began her career in show business at the age of ten, eventually becoming a regular performer in New York City's Harlem. In 1920, Smith made history by becoming the first African American singer to record a Blues song, 'Crazy Blues,' which became a massive hit, selling over a million copies and launching the 'race record' industry. This success opened doors for other influential Blues and Jazz artists, including Ma Rainey and Bessie Smith. Smith toured extensively in the U.S. and Europe, retiring from performing in 1931 but returning to appear in films later in the decade. She passed away on September 16, 1946, in New York City. Her musical style spanned classic blues, blues, ragtime, and country blues, leaving a lasting legacy in the music world. Smith's performances were known for their extravagance, featuring elaborate stage shows and costumes designed by Madame Hammer. Her impact on the music industry was profound, validating the blues genre and paving the way for future generations of musicians.
