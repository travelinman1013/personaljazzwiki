## Biography
Fernest Arceneaux (August 27, 1940 – September 4, 2008) was a French-speaking Creole Zydeco accordionist and singer from Louisiana who became known as 'The New Prince of Accordion' for his virtuosic playing. Born to a large sharecropping family in Carencro, Louisiana, Arceneaux first picked up his brother-in-law's accordion as a child and learned to play by copying his father, Ferdinand Arceneaux, a Creole accordionist whom he backed at local house parties. His early musical education was rooted in the traditional Creole music of rural Louisiana, which would shape his distinctive style throughout his career.

By the 1960s, Arceneaux had temporarily shifted away from accordion to pursue rock and roll, forming the band Fernest and the Thunders and playing guitar. However, in 1978, at the behest of his musical hero Clifton Chenier, he returned to the accordion and rediscovered his passion for zydeco music. That same year, Belgian blues enthusiast Robert Sacre discovered Arceneaux and his band, leading to the recording of their first album and extensive touring, particularly throughout Europe. This marked the beginning of his most productive period, during which he recorded numerous albums under various band names including Fernest Arceneaux and the Zydeco All Stars and Fernest Arceneaux & His Louisiana French Band.

Arceneaux's legacy extended beyond his own performances to influencing the next generation of zydeco musicians. His great-nephew Corey Arceneaux toured with him for a year in 1991 before forming his own band, Corey Arceneaux and the Zydeco Hot Peppers, with Fernest serving as his initial inspiration for taking up the accordion. Throughout his career spanning from the 1960s to the 2000s, Arceneaux remained a vital figure in preserving and advancing the zydeco tradition, earning international recognition and respect within the Louisiana Creole music community.
