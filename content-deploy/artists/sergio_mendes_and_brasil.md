## Biography
Sergio Mendes, born on February 11, 1941, in Niterói, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to a physician father, began studying classical music at the local conservatory from 1947 to 1955. His musical direction shifted profoundly after discovering jazz influences like Dave Brubeck, Horace Silver, and Art Tatum, leading him to form groups such as the Bossa Rio Sextet in the late 1950s. This sextet gained popularity across Brazil, recording the landmark LP 'Você ainda não ouviu nada' with arrangements by Antonio Carlos Jobim and Moacyr Santos, and earning an award as best instrumental group. In 1964, Mendes relocated to California, USA, forming Brasil '64 and later evolving to Brasil '66 in 1965 by adding female vocals, creating his signature bossa nova-jazz fusion sound.[1][3][5]

Signed to A&M Records by Herb Alpert and Jerry Moss, Mendes' debut Brasil '66 album 'Herb Alpert Presents Sergio Mendes & Brasil '66' became a global hit in 1966, propelled by 'Mas Que Nada'—the first Portuguese-language song to reach Billboard's top 5. The group toured extensively, including Japan where Mendes achieved Beatles-level popularity, and he produced records for artists like Gilberto Gil and Sarah Vaughan. After a mid-1970s lull, he relaunched with Brasil '77 and scored hits like 'Never Gonna Let You Go' in 1983. Mendes earned multiple Grammys, including for 'Brasileiro' in 1993 and 'Bom Tempo' in 2010, and an Oscar nomination for 'Real in Rio' from the 2011 film 'Rio,' where he served as executive music producer.[1][2][4][5]

Mendes passed away on September 5, 2024, in Los Angeles at age 83 from long COVID complications, leaving a legacy as a bossa nova pioneer who globalized Brazilian music through samba, jazz, and pop blends, influencing genres like Latin jazz and maintaining popularity in Asia and beyond.[2][3]
