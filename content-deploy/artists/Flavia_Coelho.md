## Biography
Flavia Coelho is a Brazilian-born singer and songwriter whose music fuses the rhythms and traditions of her homeland with global influences. Born in Rio de Janeiro in 1980, she experienced a turbulent childhood marked by her parents' separation and the early loss of her mother. Raised in the favelas of Rio, Coelho was exposed to the vibrant yet challenging realities of urban Brazil, which deeply informed her artistic sensibility. Her father, a collector of traditional Nordeste cassettes, and her mother, who worked as a hairdresser for drag queens, introduced her to a wide spectrum of music and performance art, fostering her love for both Brazilian and international sounds[1][3][4].

Coelho's musical journey began in earnest at age 14 when she joined girl groups such as As Solteirissimas and Single Ladies, performing to raise awareness among young women in the favelas. She honed her craft in Rio's bars, experimenting with styles from grunge and punk to samba and jazz. In 2006, driven by a desire for artistic freedom and adventure, she moved to Paris. There, she busked in the Metro and performed in cabarets, eventually meeting producer Victor-Attila Vagh, who became a key collaborator and helped her launch her recording career. Her debut album, 'Bossa Muffin' (2011), blended samba, reggae, bossa nova, and ragamuffin, and was followed by acclaimed releases like 'Mundo Meu' (2014) and 'DNA' (2019), the latter addressing themes such as corruption and social issues in Brazil[1][2][3][4].

Coelho is celebrated for her energetic stage presence and her ability to bridge Brazilian genres with global sounds, often drawing comparisons to Manu Chao. Her collaborations with artists like Afrobeat legend Tony Allen and Senegalese singer Cheikh Lô underscore her international reach and innovative spirit. Through her music, Coelho brings together samba, reggae, forró, hip-hop, and more, creating a vibrant, multicultural tapestry that resonates with audiences worldwide[2][3][4].
