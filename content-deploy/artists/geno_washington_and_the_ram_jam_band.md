## Biography
Geno Washington & the Ram Jam Band emerged as a defining force in the British soul and R&B scene of the 1960s. Geno Washington, born William Francis Washington on December 21, 1943, in Evansville, Indiana, first arrived in England as a member of the US Air Force. His dynamic presence and love for blues and soul quickly led him to jam sessions with local musicians in Ipswich and then to London's vibrant club circuit, where his impromptu performances at venues like the Flamingo Club caught the attention of guitarist Pete Gage. In 1965, Gage invited Washington to front his newly formed Ram Jam Band, a group that soon became renowned for their electrifying live shows and ability to energize audiences, particularly within the mod scene.[1][2][5]

The Ram Jam Band, initially formed by Pete Gage and Geoff Pullum, built their reputation on the London club circuit before Geno's arrival, even featuring Jamaican singer Errol Dixon. With Washington as frontman, the band recorded several hit singles, including "Water," "Hi Hi Hazel," and "Que Sera Sera," and released two of the UK's best-selling live albums of the decade: 'Hand Clappin, Foot Stompin, Funky-Butt ... Live!' and 'Hipster Flipsters Finger Poppin' Daddies.' Their high-energy performances and authentic soul sound made them a staple of British R&B, often headlining over more famous acts. The group disbanded in 1969, but Geno Washington continued to perform and record as a solo artist, later forming new bands and remaining active on the live circuit.[1][2][5]

Musically, the band drew heavily from American soul, R&B, and blues, with Geno's vocal style and stagecraft inspired by US soul legends. Their influence extended beyond their own recordings: in the 1980s, Dexys Midnight Runners paid tribute to Geno with their chart-topping single "Geno," cementing his status as a soul icon in the UK. The band's legacy endures in the northern soul movement and among musicians who cite their energetic live approach and authentic soul sound as formative influences.[1][5]
