## Biography
Doris Troy (born Doris Elaine Higginsen; January 6, 1937 – February 16, 2004) was an American R&B singer and songwriter known to her fans as "Mama Soul." Born in the Bronx to a Barbadian Pentecostal minister, Troy grew up singing in her father's church choir before being discovered by James Brown at age 16 while working as an usherette at the Apollo Theatre in Harlem. She initially recorded under the stage name Doris Payne, her grandmother's surname, and began her songwriting career by earning $100 in 1960 for "How About That," recorded by Dee Clark. Her breakthrough came in 1963 when she co-wrote and recorded "Just One Look" for Atlantic Records, which became a top 10 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 and was later covered by the Hollies, reaching number 2 on the UK charts.

Throughout the 1960s, Troy established herself as an in-demand backup vocalist and session singer, working with major artists including Cissy Houston, Dionne Warwick, the Drifters, Solomon Burke, and Chuck Jackson. Her most celebrated session work includes contributing vocals to The Rolling Stones' "You Can't Always Get What You Want" (1968), Pink Floyd's "The Dark Side of the Moon" (1973), and Carly Simon's "You're So Vain" (1972), where she provided both harmony and the famed gospel counterpoint vocal. In 1969, Troy relocated to London and was signed to The Beatles' Apple Records label, releasing her self-titled album in 1970 co-produced with George Harrison. She continued recording and performing throughout the 1970s and beyond, appearing at prestigious venues like Ronnie Scott's Club.

Troy's legacy extended beyond her recording career. In the 1980s, she co-wrote the musical "Mama, I Want to Sing" with her sister, which ran for 1,500 performances in Harlem and later opened in London in 1995. Despite being labeled a "one-hit wonder" by some, Troy maintained an impressive career longevity, continuing to work as a session singer and performer until her death from emphysema in Las Vegas on February 16, 2004, at age 67. Her contributions to soul, R&B, and rock music, particularly her influential backup vocal work, secured her place as a respected figure in music history.
