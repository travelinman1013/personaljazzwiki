## Biography
Ralph Edmund Stanley was born on February 25, 1927, in Stratton (Big Spraddle Creek), Dickenson County, Virginia, USA, and became one of the most influential figures in American bluegrass music[1][3][4]. Raised in the rural Appalachian Mountains, Stanley was introduced to the banjo by his mother, who taught him the traditional clawhammer style—a technique characterized by a downward strum with the back of the fingers, distinct from the more common three-finger picking[1][2]. After a brief stint in the U.S. Army following World War II, Stanley joined his older brother Carter to form the Stanley Brothers, a duo that would become foundational to the bluegrass genre. Their band, the Clinch Mountain Boys, was among the first to popularize the new bluegrass sound pioneered by Bill Monroe, blending mountain music, Primitive Baptist church singing, and the harmonies of the Carter Family[1][2]. The brothers wrote and recorded enduring standards such as "Mountain Dew," "Little Maggie," and "Man of Constant Sorrow," and their mournful, high-lonesome sound became synonymous with the Appalachian musical tradition[1].

After Carter's death in 1966, Ralph faced a career crossroads but chose to continue performing, eventually reviving the Clinch Mountain Boys with a roster that included future stars like Ricky Skaggs and Keith Whitley[2][4]. Stanley's solo career saw him embrace an even more traditional sound, and his haunting a cappella rendition of "O Death" in the 2000 film *O Brother, Where Art Thou?* brought him mainstream acclaim and a Grammy Award[3]. Over his seven-decade career, Stanley earned numerous honors, including the National Medal of Arts, induction into the International Bluegrass Music Hall of Honor, and the Grand Ole Opry[1][3]. He passed away on June 23, 2016, in Sandy Ridge, Virginia, leaving behind a legacy as a guardian of Appalachian musical heritage and a bridge between traditional mountain music and modern bluegrass[1][3].
