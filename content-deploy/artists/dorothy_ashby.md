## Biography
Dorothy Jeanne Thompson, better known as Dorothy Ashby, was born on August 6, 1932, in Detroit, Michigan, into a musical family. Her father, Wiley Thompson, was a self-taught guitarist who regularly hosted jazz musicians at their home, where young Dorothy would sometimes provide piano accompaniment. She attended Cass Technical High School, where she played bass and string saxophone alongside future jazz greats Kenny Burrell and Donald Byrd. After studying vocal technique and harp at Wayne State University, where she earned a bachelor's degree in music education, she began her professional career playing piano in Detroit's jazz scene.

In 1952, Ashby made the pivotal decision to focus on the harp as her primary instrument, purchasing her first harp and having her first professional engagement at a nightclub in Philadelphia. Despite initial resistance from fellow jazz musicians who viewed the harp as solely a classical instrument, she persevered by organizing free concerts and performing at dances, weddings, and parties with her trio, which included her husband John Ashby on drums. Her breakthrough came in the late 1950s when she signed with Prestige Records, releasing acclaimed albums like 'Hip Harp' and 'In a Minor Groove' that established her reputation.

Ashby revolutionized jazz by proving the harp could play bebop as adeptly as traditional jazz instruments like saxophone or piano. Hailed as the 'most accomplished modern jazz harpist,' she overcame the triple burden of being an African-American woman in a male-dominated industry while playing an unconventional jazz instrument. Her innovative approach expanded beyond traditional jazz into R&B and world music, notably demonstrated in her 1970 album 'The Rubaiyat of Dorothy Ashby,' where she incorporated the Japanese koto. She won Down Beat magazine's critics' and readers' awards for best jazz performers in 1962 and continued touring and recording until her death on April 13, 1986, in Santa Monica, California.

## Fun Facts
- She was compared to guitar legend Wes Montgomery by jazz producer Orrin Keepnews, who noted her ability to construct melodic guitar-like lines on the harp
- During the 1960s, she hosted her own radio show in Detroit where she would occasionally perform live with her husband and engage in conversation with listeners
- Her 1970 album 'The Rubaiyat of Dorothy Ashby' showcased her versatility by featuring her playing the Japanese koto, successfully integrating it into jazz compositions
- She had to overcome unique technical challenges of the harp in jazz, noting that 'you can only change two pedals at a time' while spontaneously creating jazz music
