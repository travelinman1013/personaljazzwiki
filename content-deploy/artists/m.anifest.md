## Biography
M.anifest, born Kwame Ametepee Tsikata on November 20, 1982, in Accra, Ghana, is a critically acclaimed rapper, songwriter, and producer celebrated for his innovative blend of Ghanaian musical traditions and global hip hop. The grandson of the renowned ethnomusicologist and composer Prof. J.H. Kwabena Nketia, M.anifest was exposed early to the significance of music in shaping identity and culture. He moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota, at eighteen, earning an economics degree while immersing himself in the local music scene, which helped launch his career as a professional musician.

His subsequent albums, such as 'Immigrant Chronicles: Coming to America' (2011) and 'Nowhere Cool' (2016), explore themes of migration, identity, and social commentary, resonating with audiences both in Africa and the diaspora. Known for his multilingual wordplay and storytelling, M.anifest has collaborated with global artists including Erykah Badu, Damon Albarn (Gorillaz), Burna Boy, and Tony Allen, further cementing his reputation as a boundary-crossing artist.

Returning to Accra in 2011, M.anifest became a central figure in Ghana’s hip hop and alternative music scenes, influencing a new generation of artists with his modern African musical identity. His work has garnered numerous accolades, including Best Rapper and Hip-Hop Song of the Year at the Ghana Music Awards, and he is frequently cited as one of Africa’s foremost rappers, known for his intellectual lyricism and commitment to artistic authenticity.
