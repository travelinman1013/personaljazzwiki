## Biography
GQ, an American R&B group formed in The Bronx, New York, began as Sabu & the Survivors in 1968, evolving into The Rhythm Makers in the 1970s with a focus on funk music. The core lineup included vocalist and rhythm guitarist Emanuel Rahiem LeBlanc, bassist Keith 'Sabu' Crier, keyboardist Herb Lane, and drummer Kenny Banks, who released the album *Soul On Your Side* in 1976 on Vigor Records, featuring the international dance hit 'Zone'.[1][2][4] In 1978, with Banks replaced by Paul Service and at the suggestion of their manager, the group rebranded as GQ—standing for 'Good Quality'—and signed with Arista Records, shifting to a disco-influenced sound that defined their peak success.[1][2]

Their 1979 debut album *Disco Nights* produced the massive hit 'Disco Nights (Rock-Freak)', a reworked version of 'Soul On Your Side', which topped the R&B chart for two weeks, reached #3 on the Hot Dance Club Play chart, #12 on the Billboard Hot 100, and sold over one million copies in the US.[1][2][4] Follow-ups like the Billy Stewart remake 'I Do Love You' (#20 on the Hot 100) fueled their rise, alongside albums *Two* (1980) and *Face to Face* (1982). Drummer Paul Service was replaced by Stevie 'Beatz' Adorno after a 1980 car accident wrist injury, with Adorno performing until 2010.[1][3] The group's career waned with the decline of disco, effectively ending by 1982, though LeBlanc continued as Mr. Q, releasing solo albums like *Always Be Around* (1991, Capitol) and *A Tribute to Marvin Gaye and Billy Stewart* (1999), and touring with GQ configurations, including a 2017 release *The Mr Q Project*.[1][2][3]

GQ's musical style blended funk, R&B, soul, and post-disco, built on years of New York gigging, earning a lasting legacy among funk and disco enthusiasts despite their short commercial peak. Their music has been sampled in hip-hop, and while Crier passed away in 2013 at age 58, LeBlanc remains active as the group's enduring frontman.[1][2]
