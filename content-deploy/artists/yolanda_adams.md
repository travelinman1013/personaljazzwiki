## Biography
Yolanda Yvette Adams (born August 27, 1961) is an American gospel singer, actress, radio host, and one of the best‑selling and most decorated artists in contemporary gospel music. Born in Houston, Texas, and the eldest of six children, she was raised in a deeply religious household and began singing in church at an early age.[2][5] After graduating from Sterling High School in 1979 and attending Texas Southern University, she initially worked as a schoolteacher and part‑time model before devoting herself fully to music.[2][5] Her professional career began as a lead vocalist with Houston’s Southeast Inspirational Choir, affiliated with the Church of God in Christ, where her featured solo on the early‑1980s single “For My Liberty/My Liberty” drew the attention of producer Thomas Whitfield and Sound of Gospel Records.[2][5][6]

Adams released her debut album *Just As I Am* in 1987, marking the start of a career defined by fusing traditional gospel messages with jazz, R&B, and pop sensibilities.[1][2][5] Through early projects like *Through the Storm* (1993), *Save the World* (1993), and *More Than a Melody* (1995), she developed a signature style that paired church‑rooted vocal power with contemporary production and lyrics of encouragement and spiritual resilience.[5] Her 1999 album *Mountain High… Valley Low* became a breakthrough, going multi‑platinum and winning the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Soul Gospel Album, driven by the crossover hit “Open My Heart.”[1][2][5] Over the years she has sold over 10 million albums worldwide and earned multiple honors, including four Grammy Awards, numerous Stellar and Dove Awards, American Music Awards, BET, NAACP Image, Soul Train, and BMI Awards, and recognition from *Billboard* as the No. 1 gospel artist of the 2000s.[1][2][4]

Celebrated as the “Queen of Contemporary Gospel Music” and the “First Lady of Modern Gospel,” Adams has extended her influence beyond recording into broadcasting, ministry, and public service.[2][4][5] She hosted the nationally syndicated *Yolanda Adams Morning Show*, further solidifying her role as a spiritual and cultural voice.[2][4] In 2016 President Barack Obama honored her with the Presidential Lifetime Achievement Award for her volunteer service, and she was inducted into the Gospel Music Hall of Fame in 2017 and the Black Music & Entertainment Walk of Fame in 2022.[1][2][4] With a repertoire that bridges church and mainstream audiences—spanning worship ballads, jazz‑inflected numbers, and urban gospel anthems—Adams has inspired a generation of gospel and R&B singers and helped define the sound and visibility of modern gospel on the global stage.[1][2][5]
