## Biography
Aurora Nealand is a multi-instrumentalist, composer, and sound artist based in New Orleans, Louisiana, known for her innovative approach to jazz and experimental music. Born on May 28 in California, Nealand moved to New Orleans where she immersed herself in the city’s rich musical traditions, learning from elders and participating in street performances, clubs, and second-line parades. Her work is deeply rooted in the lineage of New Orleans jazz, but she also draws inspiration from the AACM, musique concrète, and collage-based sound art. Nealand leads several ensembles, most notably The Royal Roses and The Monocle, both of which explore collective improvisation and the sonification of everyday objects and stories. Her music often blurs the lines between traditional jazz, free jazz, ragtime, and avant-garde, creating a unique sonic landscape that reflects her interest in the history and stories embedded in sound.

Nealand’s career has been marked by a commitment to community engagement and education. She has worked extensively with organizations such as Found Sound Nation, facilitating international musical collaborations and residencies, and has been involved with the Walden School for Young Composers for over two decades. Her projects, including the City Songs initiative and the theatrical production KindHumanKind, demonstrate her ability to blend music, storytelling, and social practice. Nealand’s work has been recognized with numerous awards and residencies, including at the MacDowell Colony and the New Orleans Contemporary Arts Center. She continues to be a prominent figure in the New Orleans music scene, inspiring a new generation of musicians and artists.
