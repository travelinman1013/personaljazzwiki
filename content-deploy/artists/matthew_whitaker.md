## Biography
Matthew Whitaker (born April 3, 2001, in Hackensack, New Jersey) is an American jazz pianist, organist, and multi-instrumentalist widely regarded as one of the leading young voices in contemporary jazz.[3][4] Born three months premature and weighing less than two pounds, he was given less than a 50 percent chance of survival and later diagnosed with retinopathy of prematurity, which left him blind from infancy.[3][5] His musical life began at age three, when his grandfather gave him a small Yamaha keyboard; he quickly astonished his family by playing “Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star” by ear on his third birthday.[1][3][4] By age five he was the youngest student at New York’s Filomen M. D’Agostino Greenberg Music School for the blind and visually impaired, where he studied classical piano, learned Braille music, and developed his perfect pitch.[3][4] He later broadened his training at The Harlem School of the Arts, Jazz House Kids in Montclair, NJ, and the Manhattan School of Music Precollege Jazz Program, adding organ, percussion, clarinet, and bass guitar to his skill set.[1][3][4]

Whitaker’s career accelerated at an early age through both competition wins and high‑profile appearances. In 2010 he was a winning participant in Amateur Night at the Apollo’s “Child Stars of Tomorrow,” and at just 10 years old he opened for Stevie Wonder at the Apollo Theater for Wonder’s Hall of Fame induction.[3][4][6] At nine he began teaching himself the Hammond B3 organ and, at 13, became the youngest artist ever endorsed by Hammond in the company’s 80‑plus‑year history; at 15 he was named a Yamaha Artist, again the youngest jazz pianist accorded that status.[1][2][4] He released his debut album *Outta the Box* in 2017, followed by *Now Hear This* (2019), *Connections* (2021), and *On Their Shoulders: An Organ Tribute* (2024), projects that showcase his command of straight‑ahead jazz, gospel, funk, and big‑band–inflected arrangements while featuring prominent guest musicians.[3] Alongside extensive touring in the United States, Europe, the Middle East, Asia, and Australia, he has performed at major venues and festivals including Carnegie Hall, the Kennedy Center, Lincoln Center, Jazz at Lincoln Center, the Apollo Theater, the Monterey and Newport Jazz Festivals, and SFJAZZ.[1][3][4][5] His story and creative process were highlighted in the short documentary *Thrive* and in a 2020 segment on *60 Minutes*, and he went on to become the first blind student admitted to Juilliard’s jazz studies program.[2][3] In 2025 he was appointed the inaugural artist‑in‑residence at Augustana University’s School of Music and received a Grammy nomination for his arrangement of “Super Mario Praise Break” for the 8‑Bit Big Band, underscoring both his growing artistic impact and his role as an inspiration for young musicians with disabilities.[3]

Musically, Whitaker is rooted in the jazz and organ traditions yet draws deeply from gospel, R&B, and funk. Critics and presenters often note the influence of major pianists and organists such as Art Tatum, Thelonious Monk, Oscar Peterson, Erroll Garner, Barry Harris, Jimmy Smith, Joey DeFrancesco, and Dr. Lonnie Smith in his harmonic language, phrasing, and rhythmic feel, even as his own sound is marked by a melodic immediacy and an extroverted, communicative stage presence.[3][5] His recordings and live performances frequently move between swinging acoustic trio settings, Hammond B3 grooves, and larger ensemble or big-band textures, reflecting his background in youth big bands and church music.[1][4][5] Beyond technical virtuosity, Whitaker is frequently described as an advocate and role model within the blind and visually impaired community, serving as an ambassador for organizations such as the American Foundation for the Blind and emphasizing that he is “a musician who happens to be blind,” using his platform to encourage access, education, and visibility for other young artists with disabilities.[2][5]
