## Biography
James 'Smokestack' Tisdom, born James Luther Tisdom on March 17, 1912, in Goliad, Goliad County, Texas, was a country blues singer and guitarist who spent much of his life in the Corpus Christi area and the Rio Grande Valley.[1][2][3][4] He moved frequently between these regions, embodying the itinerant lifestyle common among early 20th-century Texas blues musicians, and remained active in local scenes without achieving widespread fame.[1][6]

Tisdom's recording career was modest, beginning with sessions for Universal-Fox in the late 1940s, including tracks like 'Model T Boogie,' 'Last Affair Blues,' 'I Feel So Good,' 'Overhaul Blues,' 'Winehead Swing,' and 'Throw This Old Dog A Bone.'[4] These appeared on various compilations such as Krazy Kat KK 7445, Flyright FLYCD 941, and others into the 1990s and 2000s.[4] His style aligned with country blues and modern blues, as noted in Spotify data, reflecting raw, personal Texas blues traditions.[context] He shared stories with researcher Mack McCormick in the early 1960s, preserving oral histories of the era.[5]

Tisdom passed away on November 15, 1995, in Lockhart, Texas, leaving a small but documented legacy in obscure blues compilations that highlight post-war Texas blues artists.[2][4]
