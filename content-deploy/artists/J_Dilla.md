## Biography
James Dewitt Yancey, known professionally as J Dilla or Jay Dee, was born on February 7, 1974, in Detroit, Michigan. Raised in a musically inclined family, Dilla learned to play several instruments—including cello, keyboards, trumpet, violin, and drums—during his youth, which laid the foundation for his innovative approach to music production later in life. As a teenager, he formed Slum Village with high school friends Baatin and T3, quickly establishing himself as a formidable producer and MC within Detroit’s burgeoning hip hop scene.

Dilla’s career gained momentum in the 1990s as his signature sound—marked by soulful samples, unconventional drum patterns, and a distinctive "drunk" or "wobbly" time feel—caught the attention of major artists and collectives. He became a key member of the production teams The Ummah (with Q-Tip and Ali Shaheed Muhammad) and the Soulquarians, working closely with acts like A Tribe Called Quest, The Roots, Common, D’Angelo, and Erykah Badu. His hands-on, experimental production style set him apart, and his work on albums such as Common’s "Like Water for Chocolate" and his own "Donuts" (released just days before his death) are considered landmark achievements in hip hop and instrumental music.

J Dilla passed away on February 10, 2006, at the age of 32 due to complications from a rare blood disease and lupus. Despite his short life, his influence on hip hop, R&B, and even jazz is profound. Dilla’s innovative rhythmic sensibility and sampling techniques have inspired a generation of musicians, and his legacy is celebrated annually at "Dilla Day" festivals worldwide. His drum machine is preserved at the Smithsonian, and his music continues to be studied and revered for its creativity and emotional depth.
