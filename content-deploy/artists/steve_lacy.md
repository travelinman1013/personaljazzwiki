## Biography
Steve Lacy, born Steven Norman Lackritz in 1934 in New York City, was a pioneering soprano saxophonist who single-handedly revived the instrument from obscurity and became one of the greatest jazz musicians of the twentieth century.[1][4] Beginning his musical training as a child on piano, he progressed to clarinet before discovering the soprano saxophone, studying at the Schillinger School of Music (now Berklee) and the Manhattan School of Music in the early 1950s.[1] His early career was rooted in the Dixieland revival scene of Manhattan, where he worked as a sideman and earned his stage name from cornetist Rex Stewart. His trajectory shifted dramatically when he met pianist Cecil Taylor in 1953, who introduced him to the avant-garde and to Thelonious Monk's compositions—influences that would define his artistic vision for the remainder of his life.[5]

Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, Lacy established himself as a leading figure in free jazz and avant-garde improvisation, working extensively with Thelonious Monk's quintet in 1960 and collaborating with Cecil Taylor, Gil Evans, Ornette Coleman, and numerous international musicians.[1][3] In 1967, he married Swiss vocalist and multi-instrumentalist Irene Aebi, who became his primary collaborator and bandmate. Moving to Paris in 1970, Lacy spent 33 years in Europe performing as a soloist, leading ensembles, and engaging in interdisciplinary collaborations with visual artists, poets, dancers, and musicians from diverse traditions including Indian classical music and Moroccan Jajouka groups.[2][3] His compositional output was prolific, encompassing over 250 recordings and ranging from intimate solo pieces to extended suites for ensembles of all sizes, all characterized by distinctive intervallic leaps and vibrant rhythms that challenged the technical and interpretive boundaries of the soprano saxophone.[2]

Returning to the United States in 2002, Lacy joined the faculty of the New England Conservatory, where he taught until his death on June 4, 2004, at age 69.[1][4] His legacy as a musician who brought the soprano saxophone from near-extinction into prominence across multiple musical genres remains unparalleled. He received numerous accolades including a MacArthur Foundation "genius" grant in 1992, France's Chevalier de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in 2002, and consistent recognition from DownBeat Magazine as the premier soprano saxophonist.[4] His influence extended to major figures like John Coltrane, who was inspired to take up the soprano saxophone after hearing Lacy's work.[5]

## Fun Facts
- As a teenager, Steve Lacy photographed jazz musicians and sold their portraits at concerts—it was during these photography sessions that he first met Cecil Scott, the musician who introduced him to jazz.[5]
- Lacy was the first avant-garde jazz musician to make the soprano saxophone his primary instrument, single-handedly reviving an instrument that had become almost completely neglected during the Bebop era.[4]
- He defined his profession with a poetic flourish: 'combination orator, singer, dancer, diplomat, poet, dialectician, mathematician, athlete, entertainer, educator, student, comedian, artist, seducer and general all-around good fellow.'[1][4]
- Lacy spent 33 years living in Paris (1970-2002) before returning to the United States to teach at the New England Conservatory, where he remained until his death in 2004.[4]
