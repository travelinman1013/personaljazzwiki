## Biography
Morgus & the Ghouls was a short-lived studio band formed in New Orleans in 1959 to capitalize on the local popularity of the television horror host Morgus the Magnificent, a character created and portrayed by Sid Noel Rideau. The group brought together some of the city's most promising teenage musicians and singers, including Frankie Ford, Ronnie Barron, and Jerry Byrne, with the legendary Mac Rebennack (later known as Dr. John) contributing a distinctive guitar solo. Their signature recording, 'Morgus the Magnificent,' was produced at Cosimo Matassa’s famed studio and quickly became a cult favorite among New Orleans youth, celebrating the quirky, madcap experiments of Morgus and his late-night TV antics.

Although Morgus & the Ghouls was not a traditional touring band, their single remains a unique artifact of New Orleans’ vibrant 1950s rock and R&B scene, blending early rock 'n' roll with theatrical horror themes. The project was a tribute to the phenomenon of local horror hosts, who were gaining popularity across the United States, and it showcased the intersection of television, music, and youth culture in mid-century America. While the group did not record further material, the song 'Morgus the Magnificent' endures as a beloved novelty and a testament to the creative synergy of New Orleans musicians.

The legacy of Morgus & the Ghouls is closely tied to the enduring appeal of Morgus the Magnificent himself, whose influence extended beyond television into music and popular culture. The collaboration helped launch or boost the careers of its young participants, most notably Mac Rebennack, who would go on to international fame as Dr. John. The song is still remembered and occasionally played in New Orleans, serving as a nostalgic reminder of the city's unique blend of humor, horror, and musical innovation.
