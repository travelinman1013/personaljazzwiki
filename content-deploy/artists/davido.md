## Biography
David Adedeji Adeleke, known professionally as Davido, was born on November 21, 1992, in Atlanta, Georgia, USA, to a wealthy Nigerian family and raised primarily in Lagos, Nigeria. He briefly studied business administration at Oakwood University in the US, where he began making beats and formed the group KB International with cousins B-Red and Sina Rambo, before dropping out to pursue music. Returning to Nigeria, he enrolled at Babcock University, graduating in 2015 with a music degree after his father funded a dedicated department.[1][3]

Davido launched his career in 2011 with singles 'Back When' featuring Naeto C and the breakout hit 'Dami Duro,' leading to his debut album *Omo Baba Olowo* (2012), a blend of Afrobeats and hip-hop produced by talents like Shizzi and Maleek Berry. He founded Davido Music Worldwide (DMW) in 2016, signed with Sony Music and RCA Records, and released EPs like *Son of Mercy* (2016) and albums including *A Good Time* (2019), *A Better Time* (2020), *Timeless* (2023), and *5ive* (2025). Hits like 'If,' 'Fall,' 'Assurance,' and 'FIA' propelled his global rise, with 'Fall' becoming the longest-charting Nigerian pop song on Billboard.[1][2][3]

Davido's style fuses Afrobeats, Afrobeat, afropop, hip-hop, and R&B, earning him awards like BET Best International Act (2014, 2018), multiple Headies, and MOBOs. As a philanthropist and entrepreneur, he supports education and healthcare in Nigeria via DMW and endorsements, solidifying his legacy as a pioneer of Afrobeats' worldwide popularity.[1][2][3]
