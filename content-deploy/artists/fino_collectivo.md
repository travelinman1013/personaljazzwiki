## Biography
Fino Coletivo is a Brazilian MPB (Música Popular Brasileira) band founded in 2005 in Rio de Janeiro. The group was formed through the collaboration of musicians Wado and Alvinho Cabral from Alagoas with Marcelo Frota from Rio de Janeiro, later joined by Adriano Siri (vocals), Alvaro Lancellotti (vocals), Alvinho Cabral (guitar and vocals), Daniel Medeiros (bass and vocals), and Rodrigo Scofield (drums and vocals). Their music blends traditional MPB with elements of samba-rock and nordestina influences, reflecting the diverse backgrounds of its members.

The band's self-titled debut album in 2007 earned them critical acclaim, winning the Associação Paulista de Críticos de Arte award for 'Grupo Revelação' and the 6th Prêmio Rival Petrobras de Música, also in the revelation category. Their follow-up album, 'Copacabana' (2010), was named one of the ten best albums of the year by O Globo. Fino Coletivo's songs have been featured in major Brazilian media, including the opening of the Campeonato Brasileiro and the soundtrack of the popular telenovela 'Caminho das Índias.' In 2014, they released 'Massagueira,' inspired by a fishing village in Alagoas, and in 2015, the band went on hiatus, with members relocating to Portugal. After a seven-year break, Fino Coletivo returned to performing in 2023.

Fino Coletivo is recognized for its innovative approach to MPB, fusing carioca samba-rock with nordestina rhythms and poetic lyrics. Their legacy includes not only award-winning albums and memorable singles but also a reputation for revitalizing contemporary Brazilian music with regional authenticity and collaborative creativity.
