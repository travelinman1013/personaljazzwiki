## Biography
Quartette Trés Bien was an American jazz combo formed in St. Louis around 1960, led by pianist Jeter Thompson. The group quickly became a fixture in the St. Louis jazz scene, known for their dynamic blend of jazz, Latin rhythms, and soulful improvisation. Their early recordings, starting with their self-titled debut in 1962 on Norman Records, showcased their versatility and innovative approach, later moving to Decca Records for a string of albums throughout the 1960s. Quartette Trés Bien distinguished themselves with a unique sound that incorporated elements of Latin jazz, funk, and soul, earning them a reputation as pioneers of jazz fusion in the Midwest. After the original quartet era, Thompson continued leading the group as Trio Trés Bien, remaining active well into the 2010s and earning induction into the St. Louis Jazz Hall of Fame in 2014.

Musically, Quartette Trés Bien was celebrated for their tight ensemble playing, sophisticated arrangements, and the distinctive Latin flavor brought by percussionist Percy James. Their style bridged traditional jazz with contemporary funk and soul, making them a favorite among jazz enthusiasts and collectors. The group’s legacy endures as a testament to the vibrant jazz culture of St. Louis, influencing later generations of jazz and acid jazz musicians. Their recordings continue to be sought after, and their music is recognized for its originality and enduring appeal.
