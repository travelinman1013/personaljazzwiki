## Biography
Magna Carda is a genre-blending hip-hop group formed in Austin, Texas in 2011 by keyboardist/producer Dougie Do and rapper Megz Kelli. The group quickly expanded to include guitarist Eric “The Greek” Nikolaides, bassist Derek Van Wagner, and drummer Michael “Brotha Mike” Gonzales, building a reputation for dynamic live performances and a unique fusion of rap, jazz, R&B, and electronic music. Their mastery of live instrumentation and studio production, along with profound lyricism, has earned them critical acclaim and a prominent place in Austin’s flourishing hip-hop scene. Magna Carda has performed at major events like the inaugural X Games in Austin and shared stages with hip-hop luminaries such as The Pharcyde, Joey Bada$$, Chali 2na, and Oddisee, while receiving national press coverage from outlets like Buzzfeed and NPR.

Grace Sorensen, born in San Antonio and based in Austin, Texas, is a rising R&B and neo-soul artist known for her soulful vocals and emotionally resonant songwriting. She began her artistic journey as a dancer before grade school, training pre-professionally in various commercial dance styles before turning to music. Sorensen recorded her first single in Atlanta and later honed her craft in Austin, releasing singles like “Velvet Noise,” “Soul or System,” and her debut EP “What I Never Told You.” Her music is characterized by heartfelt lyricism and a blend of soul, R&B, and contemporary influences. Sorensen has opened for major acts such as Diana Ross and contributed vocals to projects like BLK ODYSSY’s album “BLK VINTAGE.” Her debut album, “BLUEPRINT,” released in 2023, reflects her personal journey through grief, triumph, and self-discovery, cementing her as a significant new voice in Austin’s music scene.
