## Biography
Mitty Lene Collier was born on June 21, 1941, in Birmingham, Alabama. While attending high school, she sang with the traveling gospel group Hayes Ensemble, laying the foundation for her musical career rooted in gospel traditions.[1][5][6] Discovered by Chess Records talent scout Ralph Bass during a talent show, she signed with the label in 1960, transitioning to rhythm and blues and soul music, where she performed to enthusiastic crowds at venues like the Apollo Theater and released hits such as 'I Had a Talk with God'.[3][4]

Collier's career flourished in the 1960s with Chess Records, producing successful R&B singles in genres like northern soul and Chicago soul, before she stepped away from secular music.[5][7] In 1989, she was ordained as a minister and founded More Like Christ Ministries, shifting her focus to gospel singing and pastoral work as a church pastor.[1][2][5] Her musical style bridged deep gospel influences with powerful R&B vocals, earning her a lasting legacy in soul music circles despite her pivot to ministry.[7]

Today, Collier is recognized for her contributions to soul and R&B, with a catalog that continues to resonate in northern soul scenes, while her religious calling has defined her later life.[2][5]
