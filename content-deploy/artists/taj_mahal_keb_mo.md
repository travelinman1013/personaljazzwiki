## Biography
Taj Mahal (born Henry St. Claire Fredericks Jr., May 17, 1942, New York, NY) and Keb' Mo' (born Kevin Roosevelt Moore, October 3, 1951, Compton, CA) are two of the most influential figures in contemporary blues, celebrated for their innovative fusion of traditional blues with global sounds. Taj Mahal grew up in a musically rich environment—his father was a jazz pianist with Caribbean roots and his mother a gospel-singing schoolteacher. He began exploring the roots of African American music during his college years at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, later moving to California and forming the Rising Sons with Ry Cooder. Mahal's solo career, launched in 1968, was marked by his willingness to blend blues with Caribbean, African, and Pacific influences, earning him recognition as a pioneer of world music.[1][3][4]

Keb' Mo', raised in Compton, California, started his career playing steel drums in a calypso band before moving into blues and R&B. He first recorded in the early 1970s with Papa John Creach and released his breakthrough self-titled album in 1994, which included covers of Robert Johnson classics. Keb' Mo' is known for his smooth vocals, modern songwriting, and ability to bridge traditional blues with contemporary sounds. His partnership with Taj Mahal culminated in the Grammy-winning album 'TajMo' (2017), which showcased their natural chemistry and featured collaborations with Bonnie Raitt, Joe Walsh, Sheila E., and Lizz Wright.[2][5]

Both artists have been recognized for their contributions to music with multiple Grammy Awards and have inspired generations of musicians. Their legacy lies in their ability to honor the blues tradition while expanding its boundaries through global influences, innovative collaborations, and a commitment to musical storytelling that resonates across cultures and eras.[3][4][5]
