## Biography
Tiago Guy is a Brazilian-born singer-songwriter who relocated to New Orleans in the spring of 2021, driven by a deep passion for American roots music. Growing up in Brazil, Tiago developed a strong melodic sensibility, which he later fused with the rich musical traditions of his new home in Louisiana. His songwriting often reflects the duality of his experience—farewells to his old home and greetings to his new one—blending Brazilian influences with classic American singer-songwriter styles.

Since arriving in New Orleans, Tiago has quickly become a notable presence on the local music scene, performing at iconic venues such as Tipitina’s, the Maple Leaf Bar, and the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival. His sophomore album, 'Paper Thin,' showcases his ability to weave soulful melodies with personal, narrative-driven lyrics. The album features collaborations with respected local musicians and explores themes ranging from love and loss to the unique challenges and joys of adapting to a new culture. Tiago’s music stands out for its heartfelt storytelling, melodic craftsmanship, and the seamless integration of his Brazilian heritage with the sounds of New Orleans.
