## Biography
The Sweet Inspirations are an American R&B girl group from Newark, New Jersey, founded by Cissy Houston (mother of Whitney Houston) in the early 1960s. The group's origins trace back to the late 1950s at New Hope Baptist Church in Newark, where Emily "Cissy" Drinkard served as Minister of Music, mentoring young singers including her nieces Dionne and Dee Dee Warwick, along with Sylvia Shemwell and Doris Troy. By 1958, these young vocalists formed the Gospelaires, an offshoot of the Drinkard Singers, and began their professional career as session vocalists after being discovered at the Apollo Theater in 1959. The classic lineup solidified when Cissy Houston joined in 1961, with Myrna Smith and Estelle Brown completing the nucleus by 1963.

From 1963 to 1967, the group operated informally as "The Group," becoming among the most prolific and in-demand backup singers in the soul, pop, and rock genres. They provided backing vocals for an impressive roster of artists including Aretha Franklin, Solomon Burke, Otis Redding, Jimi Hendrix, Van Morrison, Dusty Springfield, and Elvis Presley. In February 1967, they formally adopted the name Sweet Inspirations and signed with Atlantic Records, achieving both critical and commercial success. Their biggest hit, aptly titled "Sweet Inspiration," reached the top 20 of the Billboard Hot 100 and earned them a Grammy Award nomination, making them just the third all-female vocal group in history to receive such recognition. Their B-side "I'm Blue" would later gain renewed fame when sampled by Salt-N-Pepa for their hit "Shoop."

After Cissy Houston left the group following their early performances with Elvis Presley in Las Vegas to raise her family and pursue a solo career, the remaining members continued performing with Presley from 1969 to 1977 and maintained their recording career. The group evolved through various incarnations, recording for labels including Atlantic, Stax, and RSO through the 1970s disco era. Their influence on American soul music was formally recognized when they were inducted into the National Rhythm and Blues Hall of Fame in 2014. The Sweet Inspirations' legacy extends beyond their own recordings to the countless iconic tracks they helped shape as session vocalists during the golden age of soul music.
