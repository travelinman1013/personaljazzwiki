## Biography
The Rising Star Fife and Drum Band was founded by Othar 'Otha' Turner (1907-2003), a master fife player from northern Mississippi hill country, born in Canton, Mississippi, and later based near Como in Panola County. Turner began making cane fifes at age 13 and formed the band in the 1960s with friends and relatives, including Napoleon Strickland, G.D. Young, 'Cag' Young, and his daughter Bernice Turner, initially performing as the Gravel Springs Fife & Drum Band in the early 1970s. The band's style blended African-derived fife and drum traditions with Hill country blues, featuring a fife leading two kettle drums and a bass drum, playing 'Shimmy She Wobble' repertoire of blues, spirituals, and popular tunes at community picnics on the Fourth of July and Labor Day.[1][4][5][6]

After Turner's death in 2003, his 13-year-old granddaughter Shardé Thomas took over leadership, continuing the legacy by forming her own iteration of the Rising Stars in 2003 while still part of her grandfather's band. Under Thomas, born in 1990 in north Mississippi, the band modernized the sound, mixing traditional fife and drum with blues, gospel, R&B, hip-hop, and pop, releasing albums like Shardé's solo debut 'What Do I Do' (2010), 'Shawty Blues' (2013), and the band's 'Evolution of Fife and Drum Music' (2023). They gained international recognition, performing at venues like Lincoln Center, the Ryman Auditorium, and festivals worldwide, including tours in Africa, France, Switzerland, and the UK.[2][3][4]

The band's legacy preserves one of America's rarest African-rooted music forms, evolving from local farm parties to global stages while honoring Turner's picnics and recordings like 'Everybody Hollerin' Goat' (1998) and 'From Senegal to Senatobia' (1999). Shardé Thomas and her husband Chris Mallory have elevated it into a youthful blues sensation, featured in films like the Grammy-winning 'Jazz Fest: A New Orleans Story' and listed on the Mississippi Artist Roster.[3][4]

## Fun Facts
- Othar Turner hosted legendary Labor Day picnics starting in the late 1950s, butchering goats cooked in iron kettles, which inspired the album title 'Everybody Hollerin' Goat' (1998).

- The band appeared on 'Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood' episode 1509 in 1982 as the Mississippi Fife and Drum Corps with Turner, Jessie Mae Hemphill, and Abe Young.
- Turner made his first fife at age 13 from ditch-bank cane, boring holes with a red-hot rod to achieve proper intonation.
