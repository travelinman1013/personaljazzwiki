## Biography
Les Double Six, also known as The Double Six of Paris, was a pioneering French vocal jazz group founded in 1959 by singer and arranger Mimi Perrin in Paris. The group quickly gained international acclaim in the early 1960s for their innovative approach to vocal jazz, particularly their mastery of 'vocalese'—the art of setting lyrics to jazz instrumental solos. The ensemble's name referred to their unique recording technique: the six members would record their parts and then double-track them, creating the rich, full sound of a much larger choir.

Les Double Six specialized in performing jazz standards, often in French, and were known for their ability to mimic the sounds of jazz instruments such as saxophones and trumpets using only their voices. Their repertoire included works by Quincy Jones, Dizzy Gillespie, and other jazz greats. The group’s membership was fluid, with notable singers like Christiane Legrand, Ward Swingle, Jean-Claude Briodin, and Eddy Louiss participating at various times. They collaborated with major jazz figures, most famously on the 1963 album 'Dizzy Gillespie and the Double Six of Paris,' which also featured Bud Powell and Kenny Clarke.

Despite their success, Les Double Six disbanded in 1966, largely due to Mimi Perrin's ongoing health issues. Several members went on to form or join the Swingle Singers, further influencing the direction of vocal jazz. Les Double Six are remembered for their technical brilliance, their role in popularizing vocalese in Europe, and their lasting influence on vocal jazz ensembles worldwide.

- Les Double Six’s double-tracking technique was inspired by similar studio innovations in American pop and jazz, notably those used by Brian Wilson of The Beach Boys.
- Several members, including Ward Swingle and Christiane Legrand, went on to form the Swingle Singers, who became famous for jazz interpretations of Bach.
- All of Les Double Six’s singing was in French, even when performing American jazz standards.
