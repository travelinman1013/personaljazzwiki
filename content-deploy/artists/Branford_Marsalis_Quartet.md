## Biography
The Branford Marsalis Quartet, formed in 1986 by New Orleans-born saxophonist Branford Marsalis, has established itself as one of the premier jazz ensembles in contemporary music. Born into a musical family, Branford initially began on clarinet before transitioning to alto and then tenor and soprano saxophones as a teenager. His early career was marked by prestigious collaborations with trumpet legend Clark Terry and Art Blakey's legendary Jazz Messengers alongside his brother Wynton. After leaving to form the Wynton Marsalis Quintet, Branford eventually established his own quartet, which has remained his primary means of expression for nearly four decades.

The quartet has distinguished itself through its rare breadth of stylistic range, performing uncompromising interpretations of both original compositions and jazz classics. Known for the telepathic communication among its uncommonly consistent personnel and its deep book of original music replete with expressive melodies and provocative forms, the ensemble has been recognized as the standard to which other jazz ensembles must be measured. The group's evolution has been marked by key personnel changes, including the addition of pianist Joey Calderazzo in 2000 following the untimely death of original pianist Kenny Kirkland, and drummer Justin Faulkner joining in 2009. This longevity and consistency has allowed the quartet to play adventurous, sophisticated music with a level of familiarity that enables risk-taking rather than defensive playing.

Throughout its existence, the Branford Marsalis Quartet has achieved significant critical acclaim, earning six Grammy nominations and one Grammy win, along with numerous other accolades. The group's recent work includes *The Secret Between the Shadow and the Soul* (2019), recorded in Australia, and *Belonging* (2021), their Blue Note Records debut featuring a full album interpretation of Keith Jarrett's 1974 ECM album. Beyond the quartet context, Branford has distinguished himself as a multi-award-winning artist with three Grammy Awards overall, a citation by the National Endowment for the Arts as a Jazz Master, a Tony nomination for Broadway composition, and a 2021 Primetime Emmy nomination for his score for the Tulsa Burning documentary.
