## Biography
Johnny Osbourne (born Errol Osbourne in 1948) is a Jamaican singer from Kingston whose warm, flexible tenor and sharp timing made him a key figure in both roots reggae and the early dancehall era.[1][6] Raised in Jones Town, a Kingston neighborhood closely tied to sound‑system culture, he began recording in the late 1960s as lead vocalist of The Wildcats, cutting his debut single “All I Have Is Love” at Coxsone Dodd’s Studio One after early work with producer Winston Riley.[1][2] He soon recorded the rocksteady classic “Come Back Darling” with The Sensations for Riley’s Techniques label and completed an album of the same name in 1969 before emigrating to Toronto, Canada, where he spent much of the 1970s singing with various soul and reggae outfits and eventually fronting the band Ishan People on two albums.[1][2]

When Ishan People broke up in 1979, Osbourne returned to Jamaica and reconnected with Studio One, recording singles such as “Jealousy, Heartache And Pain” and “Forgive Them” and, between late 1979 and early 1980, the sessions that produced his landmark roots set *Truths and Rights* (including “Jah Promise” and the title track).[1][2] Drawing on recut Studio One rocksteady and early reggae rhythms with new lyrics, the album placed him at the forefront of a new generation of singers who refreshed classic riddims for contemporary audiences and helped bridge roots reggae into the emerging dancehall sound.[1][2] Throughout the early 1980s he became one of Jamaica’s most in‑demand vocalists, releasing albums such as *Fally Lover*, *Warrior*, *Innah Disco Style* and *Never Stop Fighting* and scoring hits like “Yo Yo,” “Lend Me A Chopper,” and “Water Pumping,” the latter an adaptation of Hopeton Lewis’s “Take It Easy.”[1][2] In the mid‑1980s he fully embraced digital dancehall with songs like “Buddy Bye” (on King Jammy’s Sleng Teng riddim), “No Sound Like We” and “In The Area,” while late‑1980s work with producer Bobby Digital produced further hits including “Good Time Rock” and “Rude Boy Skank,” securing his reputation as a singer able to move effortlessly from deep roots to raggamuffin dancehall without losing his melodic, devotional style.[1]

Osbourne’s musical style blends the spiritual, socially conscious themes of roots reggae with lovers rock smoothness and the call‑and‑response energy of sound‑system performance, often riding re‑voiced classic Studio One instrumentals with new melodies and lyrics.[1][2] His ability to reinterpret existing riddims while sounding fresh made him a favorite among producers and selectors, and his recordings have remained staples in reggae and dancehall sets worldwide.[1][5] Often described as an “inexhaustible hit‑maker,” he has continued to perform internationally, with his vintage Studio One material and 1980s dancehall sides sampled, versioned and revived by later generations of reggae, dancehall and jungle artists, cementing his legacy as one of the key voices linking the rocksteady and roots era to modern dancehall.[1][5][6]

## Fun Facts
- Osbourne recorded his debut single "All I Have Is Love" at Studio One, then left Jamaica for Canada on the very day he completed his 1969 album *Come Back Darling* for Winston Riley.[1][2]
- His hit "Water Pumping" is actually an adaptation of Hopeton Lewis’s rocksteady classic "Take It Easy", a riddim that had also powered Johnny Clarke’s "Rockers Time Now" in 1976.[1]
- On the roots landmark *Truths and Rights*, Osbourne voiced new lyrics over re‑cut Studio One rhythms like Al Campbell’s "Take A Ride" (for "Truth And Rights") and the Soul Vendors’ "Swing Easy" (for "Can’t Buy Love"), helping pioneer the practice of revitalizing classic riddims for a new era.[2]
- Despite recording many singles for Coxsone Dodd throughout the 1980s after *Truths and Rights*, the long‑promised second Studio One album from those sessions has never been officially released.[1]
