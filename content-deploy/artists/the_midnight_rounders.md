## Quick Info

- **Spotify Popularity**: 0/100

- **Origin**: United States

## Biography
Based on available evidence, there does not appear to be a documented musical act formally known as “THE MIDNIGHT ROUNDERS” in major music databases, press coverage, or historical references distinct from other similarly named groups. Searches instead surface a different, documented band called **Murphey’s Midnight Rounders**, a Midwestern acoustic/folk outfit with pagan/Americana leanings, but no credible source shortens or renames them as “The Midnight Rounders,” nor is there any verified act whose official name matches the exact phrase.

Murphey’s Midnight Rounders (often abbreviated MMR) are described as a Midwestern group performing an acoustic/country and folk hybrid, with strong vocal harmonies and original material that ranges across many emotional themes.[5][4] They have been characterized as creating a fresh, catchy, and danceable take on folk that intersects with Heathen/Pagan belief and ideas of liberty, sometimes labeled “Pagan Americana” or “power folk.”[4][8][7] The core documented lineup includes Brad Murphey, Teresa Frank, Bonnie Hann-Powers, and Josh “Hochef” Lueth, all of whom share lead and backing vocal duties.[5] However, because the artist name you provided (“THE MIDNIGHT ROUNDERS”) does not clearly or reliably map to this group in any authoritative source, it would be inaccurate to treat Murphey’s Midnight Rounders as the same act without further confirmation.

Given the absence of reliable references—no press features, discographies, label pages, or artist bios under the exact name “THE MIDNIGHT ROUNDERS”—it is most likely that this Spotify entry refers either to an extremely obscure or inactive artist with no public biographical footprint, a mis-tagged or incorrectly ingested artist profile, or a confusion with Murphey’s Midnight Rounders or other similarly named acts. Without verifiable, source-backed information directly tied to the exact name, any detailed biography would be speculative rather than factual, so only these high-level clarifications can be provided with integrity.

## Fun Facts
- No reliable public biographical or discographical information can be found for an artist whose official name is exactly “THE MIDNIGHT ROUNDERS,” suggesting the Spotify entry may represent a very obscure project, a metadata error, or an alias not documented elsewhere.
- Searches for “Midnight Rounders” primarily return information about Murphey’s Midnight Rounders, a separate Midwest-based acoustic/folk group with pagan/Americana elements, rather than an artist using the exact name “THE MIDNIGHT ROUNDERS.”[4][5][8]
- There is no known Wikipedia article, major press profile, or label/management page tied specifically to the name “THE MIDNIGHT ROUNDERS,” which is unusual for an act with any significant public activity.
- Because the name overlaps closely with other groups (such as Murphey’s Midnight Rounders and fictional or differently named bands like The Midnight or Midnight Riders), automated services may misattribute tracks or data, complicating research into the actual artist behind the Spotify profile.
