## Biography
Jeff Lorber Fusion is the pioneering jazz fusion group led by keyboardist, composer, and producer Jeff Lorber, who was born in Philadelphia in 1952. Lorber began playing piano at the age of four and, as a teenager, performed with local R&B bands before attending Berklee College of Music, where he deepened his jazz expertise and connected with future luminaries. In 1977, Lorber launched The Jeff Lorber Fusion, quickly gaining traction for their innovative blend of jazz, funk, R&B, and rock, characterized by complex harmonies, unconventional time signatures, and infectious grooves. The band initially honed their sound in Portland, Oregon, and soon achieved national and international recognition, helping to define the post-fusion sound that would evolve into contemporary and smooth jazz.[1][2][4][5][6][9]

Throughout his career, Lorber has released over 24 albums, including the Grammy-winning 'Prototype' (2017), and has collaborated with a wide array of artists across jazz, pop, and R&B. His music is noted for its melodic sensibility, rhythmic innovation, and a strong emphasis on improvisation, often featuring the Fender Rhodes electric piano as a signature element. Lorber's work as both a performer and producer has made him a central figure in the development of smooth jazz, though he has always maintained a commitment to ambitious, jazz-rooted artistry beyond marketing labels. His influence endures through his recordings, collaborations, and the many artists he has inspired and mentored.[1][2][3][4][5][6]
