## Biography
Kassa Overall is a Grammy-nominated jazz artist, drummer, emcee, singer, and producer known for his innovative fusion of jazz, hip-hop, and avant-garde experimentation. Born and raised in Seattle, Washington, to a 'black bohemian father and a white hippie mother,' Overall was immersed in a diverse musical environment from a young age, exposed to everything from Ornette Coleman to Bob Dylan. He began playing drums as a child prodigy and later taught himself beat-making, inspired by both jazz and the rhythms of hip-hop. He attended Washington Middle School and Garfield High School, where he studied under renowned local jazz educators, before graduating from the Oberlin Conservatory of Music in Ohio.[1][2][3]

After moving to New York City in 2006, Overall established himself as a sought-after sideman, performing and recording with jazz legends such as Geri Allen, Jon Batiste, Steve Coleman, Vijay Iyer, and Gary Bartz. His solo career took off with the release of 'Go Get Ice Cream and Listen to Jazz' in 2019, followed by critically acclaimed albums like 'I Think I’m Good' and 'ANIMALS.' His work is characterized by a seamless blend of virtuosic drumming, polyrhythmic rapping, and meticulous production, often addressing themes of identity, mental health, and social justice. Pitchfork has called him 'one of modern jazz music’s most audacious futurists.'[1][2][3][4]

Overall's legacy is defined by his role as a boundary-pushing artist who connects the traditions of jazz and hip-hop, both musically and culturally. He has become a driving force in contemporary jazz, collaborating with a wide range of artists across genres and influencing a new generation of musicians who see genre as fluid rather than fixed.[1][2][3][5]
