## Biography
The Dirty Dozen Brass Band, formed in 1977 in New Orleans, Louisiana, is widely recognized as a pioneering force in the modern brass band movement. Emerging from the Fairview Baptist Church Marching Band, a youth music program led by guitarist and teacher Danny Barker, the group was initially comprised of musicians such as Gregory Davis, Anthony Lacen, Charles Joseph, and Kevin Harris, who continued playing together after the original band dissolved. Their early years coincided with a decline in the popularity of brass band music in New Orleans, which gave them the creative freedom to experiment with their sound, blending traditional brass band music with bebop, funk, R&B, and modern jazz influences[1][3].

Adopting the name from the Dirty Dozen Social Aid and Pleasure Club, the band quickly became known for their energetic performances and innovative arrangements, incorporating music by Thelonious Monk, Charlie Parker, and Professor Longhair into their repertoire. Their unique 'musical gumbo' style revitalized the New Orleans brass band tradition and attracted a new generation of listeners. Over the decades, the Dirty Dozen Brass Band has toured extensively across five continents, recorded twelve studio albums, and collaborated with a wide array of artists, including Norah Jones, Widespread Panic, Elvis Costello, and David Bowie[2][3][4].

The band's legacy is marked by their role in the brass band renaissance of the late 20th century, expanding the boundaries of the genre and inspiring countless musicians in New Orleans and beyond. Their high-octane performances and genre-defying sound have made them a world-famous ensemble synonymous with innovation and the enduring spirit of New Orleans music[2][3][7].

## Fun Facts

- Their first professional recordings were promoted heavily on New Orleans community radio station WWOZ, helping launch their career with local hits like 'Lil Liza Jane' and 'My Feet Can’t Fail Me Now'[3].
- The band has performed in over thirty countries across five continents, making them one of the most internationally recognized New Orleans brass bands[2][4].
