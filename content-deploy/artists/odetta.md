## Biography
Odetta Holmes, born December 31, 1930, in Birmingham, Alabama, was a transformative figure in American folk music and a powerful voice for social justice. After her father's death, she moved with her mother to Los Angeles, where her vocal talent was recognized early by teachers. She began operatic training at age 13 and studied classical music at Los Angeles City College, initially envisioning a career in musical theater, including performances in productions like 'Finian’s Rainbow.'[1][3][4]

Odetta's musical direction shifted in the early 1950s when she became involved with folk musicians in San Francisco. She learned guitar and began performing traditional folk songs, soon moving to New York City to pursue a solo career. Her debut album, 'Odetta Sings Ballads and Blues' (1956), showcased her rich contralto voice and electrifying sincerity, earning her critical acclaim. Odetta's repertoire spanned folk, blues, jazz, and spirituals, and her performances at events such as the Newport Folk Festival and the March on Washington in 1963 cemented her reputation as "The Voice of the Civil Rights Movement."[2][3][4]

Throughout her career, Odetta collaborated with prominent artists, advocated for civil rights, and inspired generations of musicians. Her stirring interpretations of traditional songs and her commitment to justice made her a beloved figure in both the music world and the broader cultural landscape. She continued performing and recording into the 21st century, leaving behind a legacy as one of folk music’s most celebrated and influential artists.[2][3][4]
