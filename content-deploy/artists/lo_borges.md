## Biography
Lô Borges, born Salomão Borges Filho on January 10, 1952, in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, was a pivotal figure in Brazilian popular music (MPB) and a founding member of the influential collective Clube da Esquina. Growing up as the sixth of eleven children in the Santa Tereza neighborhood, Borges was immersed in a vibrant musical environment, gathering with friends and family to play, sing, and discuss the Beatles, jazz, and MPB. These formative years fostered his deep appreciation for musical fusion and collaboration.

At just 18, Borges was invited by Milton Nascimento—a decade his senior and already a rising star—to move to Rio de Janeiro and collaborate on what would become the landmark 1972 album 'Clube da Esquina.' This double album, blending baroque pop, folk, psychedelia, and Brazilian rhythms, is widely regarded as one of the greatest achievements in South American music. Borges’s own solo debut, the self-titled 'Lô Borges' (also known as the 'Disco do Tênis' for its iconic sneaker cover), was released the same year and is celebrated for its melodic inventiveness and introspective lyricism.

Though Borges’s output slowed in the 1980s and 1990s, he experienced a resurgence in the 2000s, notably co-writing the hit 'Dois Rios' for the band Skank in 2003. His influence endures through his innovative blending of Brazilian traditions with international sounds, and his compositions have been recorded by a wide range of artists, cementing his legacy as one of Brazil’s most influential songwriters.
