## Biography
Alvin Batiste (1932–2007) was a pioneering jazz clarinetist, composer, and educator born in New Orleans, Louisiana. Introduced to the clarinet by his father, Batiste was immersed in the city’s rich musical traditions from an early age and quickly distinguished himself as a prodigious talent. He became the first African American to perform as a soloist with the New Orleans Philharmonic, playing Mozart’s Clarinet Concerto while still a student. Batiste earned a bachelor’s degree in music education from Southern University and a master’s in clarinet performance and composition from Louisiana State University.

Batiste’s career spanned the breadth of jazz, from traditional New Orleans roots to avant-garde experimentation. In the 1950s, he co-founded the American Jazz Quintet, collaborating with future luminaries like Ed Blackwell and Ellis Marsalis. He performed and recorded with artists such as Ray Charles, Ornette Coleman, and Cannonball Adderley, and was a member of the innovative Clarinet Summit. Despite his formidable skills as a performer, Batiste devoted much of his life to education, founding the jazz studies program at Southern University and mentoring generations of musicians. His teaching and compositions revitalized the clarinet’s role in modern jazz, and his influence endures through the many artists he inspired.

Batiste’s legacy is marked by his commitment to both innovation and tradition. He authored instructional texts, composed orchestral works blending African and American idioms, and released a handful of acclaimed recordings, including his final album, 'Marsalis Music Honors Alvin Batiste.' He passed away in 2007, leaving behind a profound impact as both a musical visionary and a beloved mentor.
