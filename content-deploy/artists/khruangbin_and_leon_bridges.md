## Biography
Khruangbin, a Houston-based instrumental trio consisting of Laura Lee on bass, Mark Speer on guitar, and Donald 'DJ' Johnson Jr. on drums, formed in 2010 after the members met through Houston's local music scene, including St. John's Downtown Church in 2006 and Rudyard's bar in 2007. Speer and Johnson began playing together earlier, and Lee learned bass under Speer's guidance before they solidified as a band following tours backing artists like Yppah and Bonobo. Their sound draws from global influences, creating psychedelic, neo-psychedelic grooves often without lyrics, as heard in albums like their fourth studio release A LA SALA.[1][2] Leon Bridges, born and raised in Fort Worth, Texas, rose to prominence in 2015 with his breakout single 'Coming Home,' earning comparisons to Sam Cooke and positioning him as a key figure in the neo-soul revival with his '60s-inspired R&B style.[1]

The collaboration between Khruangbin and Leon Bridges began organically in 2018 when Khruangbin opened for Bridges on his Good Thing Tour. Bridges, feeling constrained by major-label expectations, shared unused song ideas with the band, leading to their first EP Texas Sun in 2020, followed by Texas Moon in 2022. These EPs blend Bridges' soulful vocals with Khruangbin's instrumental psychedelia, united by shared Texas roots and themes of faith, producing tracks like 'Texas Sun,' 'Mariella,' and 'Doris'—a tribute to Bridges' late grandmother. The partnership allowed Bridges creative liberation and inspired Khruangbin to incorporate more vocals into their own work, such as on their album Mordechai.[1][2]

Their joint projects highlight a mutual respect, with Khruangbin's eclectic, boundary-pushing style complementing Bridges' emotive songwriting, resulting in breezy yet profound music that celebrates Texas heritage while exploring spirituality and personal loss. This collaboration has elevated both artists, introducing Khruangbin to broader audiences via Bridges' fanbase and showcasing their prowess as sought-after collaborators.[1][2][3]

- Leon Bridges shared 'rejects' from his major-label sessions with Khruangbin, sparking their EPs without commercial expectations, which he described as liberating.[1]
- Their collaboration began when Bridges sang over Khruangbin instrumentals at soundchecks during the 2018 tour; Lee once texted him a track, and he responded with vocals within 24 hours.[2]
- Khruangbin insists on all three members participating in collaborations to make them feel authentic, starting after an early partial contribution to Mirabou State's 'Feel Good'.[2]
- Tracks like 'Doris' on Texas Moon are personal tributes, with Bridges honoring his late grandmother over Lee's prominent bassline.[1]
