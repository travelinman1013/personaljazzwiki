## Biography
Church of Confidence is a German punk rock band from Berlin, known for blending classic 1970s-style punk with rockabilly and psychobilly elements into a hard-edged yet melodic sound.[4] Formed in the mid‑1990s, the group emerged from Berlin’s vibrant underground scene and quickly built a reputation as a tight, street‑level live act, often associated with the city’s enduring punk and rockabilly subculture. Over the years they have released several albums and EPs on independent labels, with songs characterized by driving rhythms, sing‑along choruses, and a raw, unpolished production aesthetic that aligns them closely with traditional punk values.[4]

After an active run of records and touring through the 2000s and 2010s, the band went comparatively quiet, apart from two singles released about four years prior to their 2025 album, creating a sense of anticipation among fans.[4] In 2025 Church of Confidence returned with the album “(S)Hit Explosion,” a release noted for its concise, hook‑laden punk songs and for reaffirming the trio’s dedication to classic punk rock while still sounding fresh within the modern scene.[4] This comeback strengthened their legacy as a long‑running Berlin punk institution that has stayed true to its roots instead of pursuing mainstream crossover, keeping their status as a cult favorite among European punk and rockabilly listeners.[4]

Musically, Church of Confidence draw heavily on first‑wave punk, rock’n’roll, and rockabilly, often referenced in reviews as a Berlin answer to traditional UK and US punk outfits but with a distinctly German street‑punk character.[4] Their work sits comfortably alongside contemporaries in the European punk and psychobilly movement, and their longevity within a niche but devoted scene has given them a durable underground legacy rather than chart success. Although detailed personal biographies of individual members are not widely documented in major English‑language reference sources, the band’s recorded output and live reputation have cemented them as a recognizable name within German punk circles.
