## Biography
William "Sonny" Criss was born on October 23, 1927, in Memphis, Tennessee, and emerged as one of jazz's most tragically overlooked alto saxophonists. At age 15, he moved to Los Angeles, where he would spend most of his career developing a distinctive sound that served as a lyrical bridge between the sensuous tone of Johnny Hodges and the revolutionary bebop innovations of Charlie Parker. After finishing school in 1946, Criss quickly established himself in the West Coast jazz scene, performing with notable artists including Johnny Otis, Howard McGhee, and Billy Eckstine.

Criss's career gained momentum in 1948 when he joined Norman Granz's Jazz at the Philharmonic tour package, leading to recordings and performances alongside jazz luminaries like Stan Getz, Wardell Gray, and Howard McGhee. Despite his exceptional talent, his Los Angeles base often left him isolated from the mainstream jazz world. In the mid-1950s, he worked with Buddy Rich's quintet and recorded the acclaimed live album "At the Crossroads" with Rich and pianist Wynton Kelly. Seeking greater recognition, Criss moved to Paris where he received the acclaim he deserved and made several outstanding recordings for European labels.

Returning to the United States, Criss experienced a creative renaissance in the mid-1960s with a series of critically acclaimed albums for Prestige Records, earning him the DownBeat award for "Talent Deserving Of Wider Recognition" in 1968. His musical style combined the bluesy feeling of traditional jazz with bebop sophistication, maintaining clarity and emotional depth throughout his evolution as an artist. Tragically, on November 19, 1977, at age 50, Criss took his own life while battling stomach cancer, a condition he kept private. His death marked the loss of an artist whose playing was at its peak and who was finally receiving the recognition he had long deserved.

## Fun Facts
- Jackie Kelso once heard a live broadcast and assumed it was Charlie Parker playing, only to discover it was actually Sonny Criss - a testament to his mastery of the bebop style
- Despite recording only four single sides as a leader by 1956, Criss suddenly recorded three full LPs for Imperial Records that same year
- He kept his battle with stomach cancer completely private, continuing to perform at peak level until his death, with the truth only revealed by his mother Lucy Criss in 1988
- Criss won the DownBeat award for 'Talent Deserving Of Wider Recognition' in 1968, an accolade that perfectly captured his career-long struggle for mainstream recognition
