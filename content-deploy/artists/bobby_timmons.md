## Biography
Robert Henry 'Bobby' Timmons (December 19, 1935 – March 1, 1974) was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to a religious family and raised by his grandfather, a church minister. He began formal piano lessons as a child, studied with local teachers, and received a scholarship to the Philadelphia Musical Academy after high school. Moving to New York in 1954 at age 19, Timmons quickly immersed himself in the jazz scene, making his recording debut with Kenny Dorham in 1956 and working with Chet Baker (1956–57), Sonny Stitt (1957), Maynard Ferguson (1957–58), and Blue Note sideman sessions with Curtis Fuller, Hank Mobley, and Lee Morgan.[1][2][3][4][8]

Timmons rose to prominence as a pianist and composer with Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers (July 1958–September 1959 and February 1960–June 1961), recruited by Benny Golson, where he penned the iconic 'Moanin'' that defined the band's sound and helped birth soul jazz—a gospel-tinged hard bop style blending blues, funk, and bebop. He briefly joined Cannonball Adderley's Quintet in 1959–1960, contributing hits like 'This Here' and 'Dat Dere,' before returning to Blakey for albums including *A Night in Tunisia* and *The Freedom Rider*. Launching his solo career in 1960 with *This Here Is Bobby Timmons* (featuring Sam Jones and Jimmy Cobb), he led trios influenced by Red Garland and Ahmad Jamal, touring the US with Ron Carter and Tootie Heath.[1][2][3][4][5][7]

In the 1960s–early 1970s, health issues and alcohol curtailed Timmons' output, though he recorded prolifically including *Workin’ Out* (1966) with Wayne Shorter and Johnny Lytle, and *Quartets and Orchestra*, exploring post-bop. He performed in New York-area groups, with Sonny Red, Etta Jones, and Clark Terry's big band in 1974. Timmons died at 38, leaving a legacy as a soul jazz pioneer whose catchy, funky compositions like 'Moanin',' 'This Here,' and 'Dat Dere' influenced jazz's evolution, despite being initially undervalued as a bebop virtuoso.[1][2][3][4][5]
