## Biography
Wilson Anthony "Boozoo" Chavis (October 23, 1930 – May 5, 2001) was a foundational figure in zydeco, the vibrant dance music of Louisiana’s Creole community. Born in the Dog Hill section of Lake Charles, Louisiana, Chavis grew up in a family steeped in Creole musical traditions—his father and great-uncle Sidney Babineaux were both accordionists, and Boozoo learned by watching and listening to them as a child. He began playing accordion as a teenager, quickly gaining a reputation at local 'la-la' dance parties for his energetic style and infectious rhythms.

Chavis’s 1954 recording of "Paper in My Shoe" is widely regarded as one of the first modern zydeco records, blending Creole, blues, and Cajun elements into a distinctive sound. Despite the song’s regional success, Chavis withdrew from the music business for nearly three decades, disillusioned by unfair business practices and a lack of control over his recordings. During this hiatus, he focused on family life and training racehorses. Chavis returned to music in the early 1980s, sparking a zydeco revival with new recordings and dynamic live performances, often featuring family members in his band. His charismatic stage presence and commitment to zydeco’s roots helped sustain and popularize the genre for new generations, cementing his legacy as one of zydeco’s most influential pioneers.
