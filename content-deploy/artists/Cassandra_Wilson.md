## Biography
Cassandra Wilson, born December 4, 1955 in Jackson, Mississippi, is a Grammy-winning American jazz singer, songwriter, and producer renowned for her distinctive voice and genre-blending artistry. Raised in a musically rich environment—her father was a jazz guitarist and bassist, her mother an educator—Wilson studied piano from age six, later teaching herself guitar and developing an intuitive approach to songwriting. Her early musical experiences ranged from classical training to performing in R&B, funk, and pop bands, as well as singing in local coffeehouses and participating in musical theater.

Wilson's professional journey accelerated after a brief stint in New Orleans, where she was mentored by jazz luminaries like Ellis Marsalis and Alvin Batiste. In 1982, she moved to New York City and became the main vocalist for the innovative M-Base Collective, collaborating with artists such as Steve Coleman and Dave Holland. Her early albums explored avant-garde jazz, but she achieved wider acclaim with her 1993 Blue Note release 'Blue Light 'Til Dawn,' which showcased her reinterpretations of blues, folk, and country songs. Wilson's subsequent albums, including 'New Moon Daughter' and 'Traveling Miles,' further established her as a leading voice in contemporary jazz, noted for her creative arrangements and genre-crossing repertoire.

Wilson's musical style is characterized by her rich, smoky timbre and her fearless integration of jazz with blues, country, folk, soul, and even hip-hop elements. She is celebrated for reimagining standards and popular songs with a deeply personal, atmospheric touch, influencing a generation of vocalists. Her legacy is marked by artistic risk-taking, critical acclaim, and a lasting impact on the evolution of jazz vocal performance.
