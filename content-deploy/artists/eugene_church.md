## Biography
Eugene Church (January 22, 1938 – April 3, 1993) was an American R&B singer and songwriter, best known for his energetic blend of doo-wop, rockabilly, and boogie-woogie. Born in St. Louis, Missouri, Church was raised in Los Angeles, where his father served as a pastor. Immersed in the vibrant West Coast music scene, he began his career in the mid-1950s, initially collaborating with Jesse Belvin as part of the duo The Cliques. Their 1956 single, 'The Girl in My Dreams,' marked Church's first appearance on the charts, reaching #45 on the Billboard Hot 100.

Church soon launched a solo career, recording under the name Eugene Church & the Fellows. He scored two major hits: 'Pretty Girls Everywhere' (No. 6 R&B, No. 36 Pop) and 'Miami' (No. 14 R&B, No. 67 Pop), both of which showcased his smooth vocals and knack for catchy, danceable tunes. Throughout the late 1950s and early 1960s, Church worked with top West Coast musicians and producers, including the Googie Rene Combo and Johnny Otis, and released singles on labels such as Class, Rendezvous, and King Records. After his chart success waned, Church turned to gospel music and later pursued a career outside of music, though he returned to perform in doo-wop revues in the 1990s.

Church's style was rooted in the intersection of R&B, doo-wop, and early rock and roll, characterized by lively rhythms, soulful melodies, and a charismatic stage presence. Though his mainstream career was brief, his recordings remain influential among collectors and fans of classic R&B, and he is remembered for his contributions to the vibrant Los Angeles music scene of the 1950s and 1960s.

## Fun Facts
- Eugene Church's biggest hit, 'Pretty Girls Everywhere,' was inspired by a real-life drive around Los Angeles with Tommy 'Buster' Williams, a member of Jesse Belvin's circle.
- After leaving the music industry in the mid-1960s, Church became a beautician and opened his own beauty parlor, reportedly earning more than he did as a recording artist.
- Church returned to secular music in the 1990s, performing at doo-wop revues alongside legends like Richard Berry and Bobby Day.
- Despite his early chart success, Church's later singles produced by Johnny Otis for King Records are considered rare and highly sought after by collectors.
