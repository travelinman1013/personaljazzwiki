## Biography
Alicia Keys, born Alicia Augello Cook on January 25, 1981, in Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan, New York, is an acclaimed American singer, songwriter, and pianist. Raised primarily by her mother, Nikki Augello, a part-time actress and paralegal, Keys began piano lessons at age seven, quickly demonstrating prodigious talent. Her classical training and early exposure to diverse musical genres in New York City shaped her distinctive style, blending R&B, soul, and neo-soul influences. Keys attended the Professional Performing Arts School, majoring in choir, and graduated as valedictorian at sixteen before briefly attending Columbia University on a scholarship, which she left to pursue music full-time.[1][2][3][4][7][8]

Keys signed her first record deal at fifteen with Columbia Records but, after disputes, moved to Arista Records under the guidance of legendary music executive Clive Davis. She followed Davis to J Records, where she released her debut album, "Songs in A Minor" (2001), which sold over six million copies and won five Grammy Awards, including Best New Artist and Song of the Year for "Fallin'." Known for writing and producing her own music, Keys has continued to release critically acclaimed albums, earning a total of fifteen Grammy Awards and establishing herself as one of the most influential artists of her generation.[1][2][3][4][6]

Her musical style is rooted in her classical piano background, but she seamlessly incorporates elements of soul, R&B, hip hop, and jazz. Keys is celebrated for her soulful voice, introspective songwriting, and commitment to artistic authenticity. Beyond music, she is an accomplished actress, author, and philanthropist, with a legacy that includes inspiring a new generation of artists and advocating for social justice and empowerment.[2][6]
