## Biography
Ben Webster, born Benjamin Francis Webster in Kansas City, Missouri in 1909, is celebrated as one of the most distinctive tenor saxophonists in jazz history. Initially trained on the violin and piano, Webster's early musical development was shaped by his neighbor Pete Johnson, who taught him blues piano, and later by Budd Johnson, who introduced him to the saxophone. Webster quickly mastered the instrument and began performing professionally in the late 1920s, making his recording debut with Blanche Calloway and playing in bands led by Bennie Moten, Andy Kirk, Fletcher Henderson, and Cab Calloway throughout the 1930s.[3][4]

Webster's career reached new heights when he joined Duke Ellington's orchestra in 1940 as its first major tenor saxophone soloist. During his tenure with Ellington, Webster's style matured, blending the robust, rhythmic influence of Coleman Hawkins with the expressive lyricism learned from Johnny Hodges and Benny Carter. His solos on recordings like 'Cotton Tail' and 'All Too Soon' became iconic, and his ballad playing—marked by a breathy, sensual tone—was widely admired. After leaving Ellington in 1943, Webster led his own groups, collaborated with jazz luminaries such as Art Tatum, Oscar Peterson, Billie Holiday, and Ella Fitzgerald, and toured with Jazz at the Philharmonic. In 1964, he relocated to Copenhagen, Denmark, where he continued performing until his death in 1973.[3][4][5]

Webster's musical style is characterized by a powerful, sometimes rasping tone on up-tempo numbers and a tender, emotive approach to ballads. His legacy endures through his recordings and the profound influence he had on subsequent generations of saxophonists. Webster is regarded as one of the 'big three' swing tenors, alongside Coleman Hawkins and Lester Young, and his contributions to jazz remain among the genre's finest.[4][5]
