## Biography
Joseph "Smokey" Johnson Jr. (November 14, 1936 – October 6, 2015) was a foundational American drummer whose work helped define the sound of New Orleans rhythm and blues, funk, and jazz. Born and raised in the Treme neighborhood of New Orleans, Johnson initially played trombone in school bands before switching to drums at age 12, quickly becoming a prominent figure in the city's vibrant music scene[4][5]. His dynamic drumming style, blending traditional New Orleans rhythms with innovative syncopation, made him a sought-after session musician and bandleader.

Johnson's career flourished through the 1950s and 1960s, as he became a key session player for many of New Orleans' most important recording studios and artists. He is perhaps best known for his influential 1964 single "It Ain't My Fault," which became a staple of the New Orleans brass band repertoire and has been widely sampled and covered[6]. Johnson's versatility allowed him to contribute to jazz, funk, and blues recordings, and his work as a songwriter and arranger further cemented his legacy as a backbone of the New Orleans sound[2][3].

Despite health setbacks later in life, Johnson remained a beloved figure in the local music community, revered for both his technical skill and his role in mentoring younger musicians. His rhythmic innovations and recordings continue to inspire drummers and musicians worldwide, securing his place as one of New Orleans' most influential musical architects.
