Paul Norris Bollenback was born on June 6, 1959, and began his musical journey at age seven when his father, a classically trained trumpeter and music lover, gave him a nylon-string guitar. When Paul was eleven years old, his family moved to India, where he spent three years that profoundly shaped his musical sensibilities and developed his taste for exotic musical elements. He later attended the University of Miami as a music major and studied privately for eight years with a Baltimore-based professor of theory and composition, establishing a strong foundation in both performance and composition.

Bollenback launched his professional career in 1981 and quickly established himself as a versatile jazz guitarist and recording artist. He made his first record with saxophonist Gary Thomas in 1987 and met organist Joey DeFrancesco in 1990, beginning a collaborative relationship that has endured for decades. Throughout his career, he has performed as a sideman with numerous jazz luminaries and has appeared on major television programs including Entertainment Tonight, The Tonight Show, The Today Show, and Joan Rivers. Based in the New York City area, Bollenback has built a reputation as both a performer and educator.

Bollenback's emotionally expressive style and eclectic approach reflect a wide range of influences, including Carlos Santana and Wes Montgomery, among others. His versatility as a jazz guitarist, combined with his compositional abilities and teaching expertise, has made him a respected figure in the contemporary jazz community. He continues to work as a recording artist, composer, and educator, maintaining an active presence in jazz performance and instruction.
