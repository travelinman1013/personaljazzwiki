## Biography
Qendresa is a self-taught singer, songwriter, producer, and DJ born to Kosovar parents and raised in North West London, specifically in the Kilburn area, within London's Kosovan diaspora. Her formative years were shaped by the female-led 90’s R&B era, alongside influences from soul, funk, electronic music, hip hop, grime's golden era, UK rap, Sade, and Mariah Carey, which inform her alternative R&B and neo-soul sound that blends nostalgia with modern electronic elements. Growing up in a culturally rich environment, she embodies London's melting pot, infusing her music with personal explorations of roots, relationships, and retrofuturistic vibes, as seen in projects like her EP 'Londra' (2025), co-produced with Jordan Lee, featuring tracks such as '2 Much,' 'The Bounce,' and 'Whenever You’re Ready.'[1][2][3][4][6][7]

Qendresa's career has developed through self-production and versatile performances, including high-profile events like Milan Fashion Week, Raf Simons X Adidas, Levis, and Fiorucci launches, as well as a monthly residency on NTS radio. She has released singles like 'Don’t Stop,' 'Real Luv,' and '2 Much,' building a signature style of silky vocals over deep bass and 808s, often with live band elements. Co-signed by figures like Lil Yachty and Daniel Kaluuya, she performs at festivals such as Pitchfork Music Festival London and maintains an active presence in the UK neo-soul scene, with her second project 'Londra' marking a sophomore milestone that reconstructs 90’s R&B, pop, and electronic sounds.[1][2][3][4][7]

While still emerging, Qendresa's legacy lies in her authentic representation of diaspora experiences and her hands-on approach to music creation, from production to visuals, prioritizing meaningful messages over commercial polish. Her work continues to evolve, promising unexpected innovations as she solidifies her place in London's vibrant music landscape.[1][3][7]
