## Biography
Marcos Sacramento Rimoli, widely known as Marcos Sacramento, is a Brazilian singer, composer, and actor born on July 27, 1960, in Niterói, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.[5] He emerged in the mid‑1980s as an interpreter of classic Brazilian popular music (MPB), recording early on in projects dedicated to composers such as Custódio Mesquita, and gradually became recognized as a refined, theatrical vocalist with a special affinity for samba and choro traditions.[6][3] Over the years he developed a reputation on the Rio de Janeiro scene for his powerful voice, precise diction, and dramatic stage presence, qualities that led to invitations for concerts in Brazil and abroad and to a growing discography that now spans more than fifteen albums.[2]

Sacramento’s career gained wider critical attention through albums that combined lesser‑known historical sambas with contemporary compositions, often framed by inventive arrangements that highlight his ability to move between traditional and experimental aesthetics.[3][4] Critics have described him as an artist who ‘breathes new life into old sambas’ and as one of the best‑kept secrets of Brazilian popular music, in part because his work often favors depth of repertoire over mainstream exposure.[3][4] In the 2000s and 2010s he expanded into theater, acting from around 2010 onward, and participating in musical productions that drew on his interpretive strengths as a singer.[5] Sacramento’s recordings have earned him nominations for the Latin Grammy Awards, and his work has reinforced the continuity of Rio’s samba lineage by connecting canonical authors such as Vinicius de Moraes with new generations of listeners through carefully curated, concept‑driven albums.[2][7]

Stylistically, Sacramento is rooted in samba but fluent across MPB, choro, and related genres, often creating hybrids that juxtapose historical repertoire with modern harmonic approaches and rhythmic nuances.[3] His albums frequently explore thematic concepts or pay homage to specific composers, and his interpretive style combines classical vocal control with the emotional immediacy associated with Rio’s bohemian samba circles.[2][3] Although not a mass‑market figure, he is regarded by specialized critics and aficionados as a key contemporary interpreter of Brazilian song, sustaining and renewing traditions through both recordings and live performances.[3][4][8]

## Fun Facts
- Despite being praised by critics as an outstanding interpreter and ‘best‑guarded secret’ of Brazilian popular music, Sacramento has remained relatively little known to the broader mainstream public, a situation some writers attribute to limited record‑company promotion.[4]
- He has released more than fifteen albums over his career, a substantial discography for an artist who is still often described as under‑recognized outside specialized Brazilian music circles.[2]
- Around 2010 he added professional theater acting to his activities, appearing in stage productions that make use of both his singing and dramatic skills.[5]
- In international presentations he has been noted for bringing to foreign audiences the repertoire of classic Brazilian authors such as Vinicius de Moraes, helping connect traditional MPB and samba literature with listeners beyond Brazil.[7]

- [[vinicius_de_moraes|Vinicius de Moraes]] - Sacramento distinguished himself by performing works by poet‑lyricist Vinicius de Moraes, integrating Vinicius’s repertoire into his concerts and recordings and drawing on the MPB and bossa nova tradition as a key stylistic reference.
