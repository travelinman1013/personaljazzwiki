## Biography
The Temptations, an iconic American vocal group, were formed in Detroit, Michigan, in 1961 from the merger of two doo-wop groups: the Primes (featuring Eddie Kendricks and Paul Williams, originally from Birmingham, Alabama) and the Distants (including Otis Williams, Melvin Franklin, and Elbridge 'Al' Bryant). Initially named The Elgins, they auditioned for Motown founder Berry Gordy, who signed them immediately but renamed them The Temptations after discovering another group used the Elgins name. Early years were challenging, earning them the nickname 'Hitless Temptations' at Motown, as they provided background vocals for artists like Mary Wells while seeking their breakthrough.[1][2][3][6]

Their career exploded in 1964 with the 'Classic Five' lineup of Otis Williams, Melvin Franklin, Eddie Kendricks, Paul Williams, and new member David Ruffin. Smokey Robinson produced their first Top 20 hit, 'The Way You Do the Things You Do,' followed by the chart-topping 'My Girl' in 1965, establishing their smooth, choreographed soul style. Under producer Norman Whitfield from 1968, they pioneered psychedelic soul with hits like 'Cloud Nine,' blending R&B, funk, and innovative arrangements, becoming Motown's most successful act with multiple #1 singles and albums through the 1970s amid frequent lineup changes due to internal conflicts.[1][2][3][5]

Despite shifts—including Ruffin's 1968 exit, Kendricks' departure in 1971, and ventures to Atlantic Records before returning to Motown—the group endured, earning the first Grammy for a Motown act ('Cloud Nine' in 1969) and a Lifetime Achievement Award in 2013. Otis Williams remains the sole original member, guiding their legacy in soul, Motown, and classic soul genres, with over five decades of influence on R&B evolution.[2][4]

## Fun Facts
- Initially nicknamed 'The Hitless Temptations' at Motown due to early lack of chart success before their 1964 breakthrough.
- David Ruffin demanded a mink-lined limousine separate from bandmates, contributing to his 1968 dismissal from the Classic Five.
- Otis Williams and David Ruffin were childhood friends living one block apart in Detroit, leading to Ruffin's recruitment in 1964.
- The group debuted at the Apollo Theater as background singers for Mary Wells in the early 1960s.
