## Biography
Jason Gould, born December 29, 1966, in New York City, is the only child of legendary singer and actress Barbra Streisand and acclaimed actor Elliott Gould. Raised in Los Angeles, he grew up surrounded by music and the arts, with early memories of spinning records by Dionne Warwick and The Fifth Dimension. Despite his famous lineage, Gould's childhood was marked by his parents' separation and a search for his own identity amid the pressures of celebrity.

Gould first appeared in the public eye as an actor, with roles in films such as 'Say Anything...' (1989) and 'The Prince of Tides' (1991), the latter directed by and co-starring his mother. He later made his West End theatre debut in 'The Twilight of the Golds' in London. However, his true passion emerged in music, which he began to pursue seriously in 2011. Gould released his debut EP 'Jason Gould' in 2012, followed by the full-length album 'Dangerous Man' in 2017, and several subsequent EPs including 'Dark Grey Skies' (2021) and 'Sacred Days' (2024). His music blends modern pop with classic influences, characterized by emotional honesty, lyrical depth, and a warm, expressive vocal style.

Gould's musical journey has been one of self-discovery and late blooming, shaped by both the legacy he inherited and his personal quest for authenticity. He has performed and recorded with his mother, including a duet on 'How Deep Is the Ocean?' for her 2014 album 'Partners,' and has worked with acclaimed producers such as Quincy Jones and Guy Roche. Today, Gould is recognized for his heartfelt songwriting and his ability to bridge tradition and innovation, carving out a unique space in contemporary pop music.
