## Biography
Otis Taylor was born in Chicago in 1948 and moved to Denver as a child after his uncle was shot to death, growing up in a household where his parents were jazz fans.[1][3][5] Inspired by the Denver Folklore Center founded by Harry Tuft, he discovered Piedmont, Delta, country, and Chicago blues artists like Son House, Muddy Waters, and Mississippi Fred McDowell, learning guitar and harmonica in his teens.[1][2][4] He formed his first band, the Butterscotch Fire Department, followed by the Otis Taylor Blues Band, and briefly pursued opportunities in London with Blue Horizon Records in the late 1960s before returning to Boulder to play with artists like Tommy Bolin in T&O Short Line, Zephyr, and the 4-Nikators.[1][2][7]

In 1977, Taylor left music amid industry changes, building a successful career as a high-end antiques dealer and coaching one of the first African American bicycle racing teams, which ranked 4th nationally.[1][3][5] He returned in 1995 at the urging of bassist Kenny Passarelli, performing at Buchanan’s coffeehouse in Boulder with Passarelli and Eddie Turner, leading to his debut album *When Negroes Walked the Earth* (1997), praised as 'minimalist blues in the John Lee Hooker mode.'[1][4] His breakthrough *White African* (2001) addressed personal themes like his great-grandfather's lynching, earning four W.C. Handy Award nominations and 'Best New Artist Debut,' while developing his 'trance blues' style blending rhythmic guitar, banjo, mandolin, and harmonica with lyrics on racism, poverty, murder, and redemption.[1][3][5]

Taylor's career includes a 2000 Sundance Composers Lab fellowship, music for Hollywood films and TV, and albums like *Definition of a Circle* (2007, named Blues CD of the Year by *Downbeat* with Gary Moore) and *Recapturing the Banjo* (2008) highlighting black banjoists such as Keb’ Mo’, Alvin Youngblood Hart, Don Vappie, Guy Davis, and Corey Harris.[1][3] He founded the Trance Blues Festival in Boulder in 2010 and has released 15 albums as of 2023's *Banjo*, earning multiple Blues Music Awards and international recognition for pushing blues forward.[3][6][8]
