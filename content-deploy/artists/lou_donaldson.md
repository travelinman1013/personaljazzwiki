## Biography
Lou Donaldson, born November 1, 1926 in Badin, North Carolina, was a pioneering American jazz alto saxophonist renowned for his soulful, blues-infused sound. Growing up in a musical family, Donaldson began with clarinet before switching to alto saxophone after hearing Charlie Parker perform, an experience that profoundly influenced his early style. After serving in the Navy and performing in the Great Lakes Navy Band, he attended North Carolina A&T University, where he completed a thesis on the transition from swing to bebop.

Donaldson moved to New York in 1950, quickly establishing himself in the vibrant jazz scene. He made his first recordings with the Charlie Singleton Orchestra and soon became a sought-after sideman, working with jazz luminaries such as Milt Jackson, Thelonious Monk, Clifford Brown, Horace Silver, and Art Blakey. His work with Art Blakey’s Quintet on the 'A Night at Birdland' sessions in 1954 is considered a cornerstone of hard bop. In the 1960s, Donaldson helped define the soul jazz genre, notably through his collaborations with organist Jimmy Smith and his own classic albums for Blue Note Records, including the hit 'Alligator Bogaloo.'

Donaldson’s legacy is marked by his ability to bridge bebop, hard bop, and soul jazz, influencing the direction of jazz for decades. His distinctive tone, groove-oriented compositions, and mentorship of younger musicians left an indelible mark on the genre. He remained active as a performer and recording artist well into the 21st century, earning numerous honors and cementing his status as a jazz legend.
