## Biography
Erroll Garner was born on June 15, 1921, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, into a musical family and began playing piano by ear at the age of three. Entirely self-taught and unable to read music, Garner was performing professionally by seven and appeared on local radio with the Candy Kids during his childhood. His early career flourished in Pittsburgh's vibrant jazz scene, playing with local bands and on riverboats before moving to New York in 1944, where he quickly established himself among the jazz elite.

Garner developed a highly distinctive piano style, marked by lush, inventive introductions, a swinging left hand, and a playful sense of improvisation. His playing was often compared to Art Tatum, Fats Waller, and even Claude Debussy, blending stride, swing, and impressionistic harmonies. He achieved international fame with his 1955 album 'Concert by the Sea,' which became one of the best-selling jazz albums ever, and his composition 'Misty,' now a jazz standard. Throughout his prolific career, Garner recorded for over 40 labels, composed nearly 200 works, and performed worldwide, appearing on major television shows and in prestigious concert halls.

Despite never learning to read music, Garner's influence on jazz piano is profound. He was celebrated for his exuberant performances and his ability to connect with audiences, leaving a legacy that endures through ongoing reissues and tributes. Garner passed away in Los Angeles on January 2, 1977, but his music continues to inspire new generations of musicians and listeners.
