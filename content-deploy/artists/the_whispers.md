## Biography
The Whispers are a legendary American R&B vocal group formed in 1963 in the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles, California. The original lineup featured identical twin brothers Wallace "Scotty" and Walter Scott, along with Nicholas Caldwell, Marcus Hutson, and Gordy Harmon. Initially performing as the Eden Trio, the group evolved into The Whispers after merging with the Scott brothers and gaining attention for their smooth harmonies and polished stage presence. Their early years were marked by relentless practice and performances at local venues, drawing inspiration from doo-wop and classic soul acts.

After relocating to the San Francisco Bay Area in 1966 at the invitation of Sly Stone, The Whispers built a reputation as a dynamic live act. They achieved their first major success in 1970 with the Ron Carson-produced single "Seems Like I Got to Do Wrong." The group’s sound matured through the 1970s, incorporating elements of funk, disco, and the emerging quiet storm style. Their commercial breakthrough came after signing with SOLAR Records in 1978, producing hits like "And the Beat Goes On" and "Rock Steady," which topped R&B and dance charts in the US and UK. Despite lineup changes, including the addition of Leaveil Degree after Gordy Harmon's departure, The Whispers maintained their signature smooth vocal blend and continued to release charting albums and singles throughout the 1980s and beyond.

The Whispers’ enduring appeal lies in their ability to adapt to changing musical trends while staying true to their roots in classic soul and vocal harmony. Their influence extends across generations of R&B, and they are recognized as one of the longest-running and most respected vocal groups in the genre, with a legacy of platinum albums, timeless ballads, and energetic dance tracks.
