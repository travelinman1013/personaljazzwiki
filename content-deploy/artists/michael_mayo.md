## Biography
Michael Mayo is a Los Angeles-born vocalist, composer, and arranger recognized for his innovative approach to vocal jazz, blending elements of neo-soul, R&B, and experimental music. Raised in a family deeply rooted in the music industry—his mother, Valerie Pinkston, sang with icons like Beyoncé and Diana Ross, while his father, Scott Mayo, played saxophone and worked with Earth, Wind & Fire—Mayo was immersed in professional musicianship from an early age. These formative experiences, including watching his parents perform backstage, instilled in him a profound understanding of musical artistry and performance[1][2][4][5].

Mayo honed his craft at the New England Conservatory of Music and became only the third vocalist ever accepted into the prestigious Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz (now the Herbie Hancock Institute of Jazz) at UCLA, where he was mentored by Herbie Hancock himself[3][7][9]. His debut album, 'Bones' (2021), received critical acclaim for its lush, multi-layered vocal arrangements and introspective songwriting, with Jazzwise praising his 'clear tenor' and innovative use of vocal harmonies. In 2024, he released his second album, 'Fly,' recorded in just two days with a stellar ensemble including Shai Maestro, Linda May Han Oh, and Nate Smith, further establishing his reputation as a boundary-pushing artist[1][2][5].

Mayo's musical style is characterized by advanced vocal techniques, live looping, and genre-defying improvisation, often drawing comparisons to Bobby McFerrin. He has toured internationally, headlined major jazz festivals, and collaborated with luminaries such as Herbie Hancock and Ben Wendel. Through his artistry, Mayo continues to redefine the possibilities of the human voice in contemporary jazz, inspiring a new generation of vocalists[3][5].
