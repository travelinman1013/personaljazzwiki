## Biography
Mulatu Astatke, born on December 19, 1943, in Jimma, Ethiopia, is widely celebrated as the father of Ethio-jazz—a genre he pioneered by blending traditional Ethiopian music with Western jazz and Latin influences. His early musical interests were shaped by encounters with big bands at the National Theatre in Addis Ababa, which inspired him to pursue formal training abroad. Astatke studied music in London, New York City, and Boston, becoming the first African student at Berklee College of Music, where he mastered the vibraphone and received an honorary doctorate in 2012.[4][5][6]

In the 1960s and 1970s, Astatke developed his signature style, introducing the vibraphone and conga drums to Ethiopian popular music and leading instrumental ensembles during Ethiopia’s Golden Age of Music. His groundbreaking albums, such as 'Mulatu of Ethiopia' (1972) and 'Yekatit Ethio Jazz' (1974), showcased his fusion of Ethiopian scales and rhythms with jazz, funk, and soul. He collaborated with prominent artists, including Mahmoud Ahmed and Duke Ellington, and contributed to the establishment of jazz pedagogy in Ethiopia through initiatives like the African Jazz Village.[4][6]

Astatke’s legacy extends beyond Ethiopia, as his music has been rediscovered and celebrated internationally, notably through the 'Éthiopiques' reissue series. His influence resonates in contemporary jazz, world music, and hip-hop, with his works sampled by artists globally. Astatke continues to perform and record, maintaining a vital role in the evolution of modern African music.[4][1][7]
