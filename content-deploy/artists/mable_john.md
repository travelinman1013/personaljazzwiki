## Biography
Mable John (November 3, 1930 – August 25, 2022) was a pioneering American blues and soul singer, best known as the first female artist signed by Berry Gordy to Motown's Tamla label. Born in Bastrop, Louisiana, and raised in Arkansas and Detroit, John was the eldest of nine siblings, including R&B legend Little Willie John. Her early exposure to gospel and blues in the South, combined with Detroit's vibrant music scene, shaped her powerful and expressive vocal style.

John's career began in earnest when she caught the attention of Berry Gordy, who coached her and signed her to Motown in the late 1950s. Although her Motown singles did not achieve major commercial success, she found her stride as a member and later leader of Ray Charles' backing group, the Raelettes, and as a solo artist at Stax Records. At Stax, she scored her biggest hit with 'Your Good Thing (Is About to End)' in 1966, showcasing her blend of blues, gospel, and soul. After her recording career, John became a minister and devoted herself to community outreach in Los Angeles, while continuing to influence generations of soul and R&B artists.

Mable John's legacy endures through her trailblazing role at Motown, her soulful recordings at Stax, and her mentorship of younger musicians. Her life and work were later celebrated in film and documentary appearances, and she received a Pioneer Award from the Rhythm and Blues Foundation in 1994.
