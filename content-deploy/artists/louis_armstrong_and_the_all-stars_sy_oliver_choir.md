## Biography
Louis Armstrong, born on August 4, 1901, in New Orleans, Louisiana, rose from poverty in the city's Black neighborhoods to become a foundational figure in jazz. He began playing cornet in the Waifs' Home band after a juvenile arrest, gaining early experience with local ensembles like Kid Ory's band and the Tuxedo Brass Band. Mentored by Joe 'King' Oliver, Armstrong moved to Chicago in 1922 to join Oliver's Creole Jazz Band, where he honed his inventive soloing style, shifting jazz from collective improvisation to individual expression[2]. His time with Fletcher Henderson's Orchestra in New York (1924-1925) further elevated his profile, influencing players like Coleman Hawkins[2].

In the late 1920s, Armstrong formed his Hot Five and Hot Seven groups in Chicago, recording seminal tracks like 'Potato Head Blues' that showcased his virtuosic trumpet and emerging vocal scat style[2]. By 1947, under manager Joe Glaser's guidance, he transitioned from big bands to the small-group Louis Armstrong and His All-Stars, a traditional jazz combo featuring top Dixieland and swing musicians, debuting successfully at Town Hall and Billy Berg's Supper Club[2][3]. This era included collaborations with arrangers like Sy Oliver, whose choir accompanied Armstrong on albums such as 'Louis and the Good Book,' blending gospel-infused swing with Armstrong's emotive melody exposition on tracks like 'Swing Low, Sweet Chariot'[1][6]. His style fused blues, swing, and jazz with gravelly vocals and improvisational brilliance[2].

Armstrong's legacy endures as jazz's most influential artist, popularizing scat singing, trumpet virtuosity, and charismatic performance worldwide until his death on July 6, 1971. The All-Stars period solidified his role as a bandleader of relaxed, feature-driven ensembles, while works with Sy Oliver's Choir highlighted his ability to elevate spirituals and pop material into timeless classics[1][3][5].
