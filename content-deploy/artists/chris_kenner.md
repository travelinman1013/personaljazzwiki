## Biography
Chris Kenner (December 25, 1929 – January 25, 1976) was a pivotal figure in New Orleans rhythm and blues, both as a singer and a songwriter. Born in Kenner, Louisiana, he grew up singing gospel in his father's church choir before moving to New Orleans as a teenager, where he worked as a longshoreman and began writing secular music. His early career was rooted in gospel, but by the mid-1950s, Kenner had shifted to R&B, recording his first singles for Baton Records and then Imperial Records, where his song 'Sick and Tired' became a regional hit and was later popularized nationally by Fats Domino.

Kenner's breakthrough came in the early 1960s after teaming up with pianist and arranger Allen Toussaint at Instant Records. Together, they produced 'I Like It Like That,' which soared to No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1961 and became a gold record. He followed this with 'Something You Got' and the enduring classic 'Land of 1000 Dances,' both of which were widely covered by artists across genres. Despite his songwriting success, Kenner's career was hampered by personal struggles, including alcoholism and legal issues, which led to a prison sentence in the late 1960s. He attempted a comeback after his release in 1973 but was unable to regain his earlier prominence. Kenner died in New Orleans in 1976, leaving a legacy as one of the Crescent City's great unsung musical innovators.
