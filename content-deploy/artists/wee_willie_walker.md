## Biography
Wee Willie Walker, born Willie Earl Walker on December 23, 1941 in Hernando, Mississippi, grew up in Memphis, Tennessee, where he was immersed in the city’s vibrant gospel and soul traditions. As a teenager, he sang with the Redemption Harmonizers, a gospel group that included Roosevelt Jamison, and attended Booker T. Washington High School alongside future soul luminaries. In 1960, while touring with the Harmonizers, Walker decided to settle in Minneapolis, Minnesota, where he joined the Val-Dons (later Valdons), a local R&B group, and later formed his own band, Wee Willie Walker and the Exciters.[1][3]

Walker’s recording career began in the mid-1960s with Goldwax Records in Memphis, where he released soulful singles such as his cover of the Beatles’ “Ticket to Ride” and “There Goes My Used To Be.” Despite the critical acclaim of his recordings, commercial success eluded him, partly due to missed opportunities and contractual restrictions. He continued to perform locally while working as a machinist and later in health care. In the 2000s, after retiring from his day job, Walker experienced a career resurgence, recording three albums with the Minneapolis R&B band The Butanes and later collaborating with artists such as Rick Estrin and Anthony Paule. His 2017 album, 'After a While,' earned five Blues Music Award nominations and brought him late-career recognition as one of soul’s most expressive voices.[2][3]

Walker's musical style blended the emotive phrasing of Sam Cooke, the grit of Otis Redding, and the smoothness of Al Green, earning him a reputation among aficionados as a 'giant at 5’2”' in the soul and blues world. He toured internationally in his later years, influencing a new generation of soul and blues musicians. Walker passed away in Saint Paul, Minnesota, on November 19, 2019, leaving behind a legacy of heartfelt performances and recordings cherished by soul and blues enthusiasts.[2][3]
