## Biography
Mulatu Astatke, born on December 19, 1943, in Jimma, Ethiopia, is an Ethiopian musician, composer, and arranger widely recognized as the father of Ethio-jazz, a genre he pioneered by fusing traditional Ethiopian sounds and instruments with Western jazz, Latin music, funk, and soul. He received formal musical training at Lindisfarne College and Trinity College of Music in London, followed by studies in New York City and at Berklee College of Music in Boston, where he became the first African student in the 1960s and later earned an honorary doctorate in 2012. As a multi-instrumentalist proficient on vibraphone, conga drums, percussion, keyboards, and organs—instruments he introduced to Ethiopian popular music—Astatke developed his signature style during this period, performing with his Ethiopian Quintet in New York and absorbing influences from the vibrant jazz scene.[1][2][3][4][6]

Returning to Ethiopia in the early 1970s, Astatke brought Ethio-jazz to Addis Ababa, leading bands and collaborating on recordings during the Ethiopian Golden Age of Music. He released key albums like *Mulatu of Ethiopia* (1972) in New York and *Yekatit Ethio Jazz* (1974) via Amha Records, featuring instrumental tracks that blended Ethiopian scales and rhythms with complex jazz arrangements. His work remained influential locally until the late 1990s, when the *Éthiopiques* reissue series by Buda Musique brought global attention, amplified by his music's use in Jim Jarmusch's 2005 film *Broken Flowers*. Astatke continued performing and recording, including *Sketches of Ethiopia* (2013) with London jazz musicians and appearances with international ensembles.[1][5][6][7]

Astatke's legacy endures as a foundational figure in world music, with ongoing tours, performances at venues like the Kennedy Center and Barbican Centre, and efforts to develop traditional Ethiopian instruments. His innovative fusion has inspired renewed interest in Ethiopian music, earning him acclaim as a vibraphone master whose contemplative and rhythmic style bridges continents.[3][5][6]
