## Biography
Clifton Chenier, born June 25, 1925, near Opelousas, Louisiana, was the son of sharecropper parents and learned to play the accordion from his father Joseph, a local musician[1][6]. Growing up in a Creole community, Chenier was immersed in the region’s rich musical traditions, absorbing influences from Cajun, French, and African American styles. By the late 1940s, after moving to Lake Charles and later Port Arthur, Texas, he began performing with his brother Cleveland at local gatherings, taverns, and picnics, gradually developing his own distinctive style[1][3].

Chenier’s career accelerated in the 1950s when he recorded his first single, 'Cliston Blues/Louisiana Stomp,' and gained national attention with 'Ay-Tete-Fille (Hey Little Girl)' in 1955[1]. He signed with several labels, including Specialty, Chess, and Arhoolie, and formed the Zodico Ramblers, featuring notable blues musicians. Chenier’s music fused Cajun two-steps and waltzes with blues, R&B, and rock and roll, creating the modern sound of zydeco[1][5]. His energetic performances and innovative use of the accordion and vest frottoir (rub board) helped popularize zydeco beyond Louisiana, especially after his breakthrough appearance at the Berkeley Blues Festival in 1966[5].

Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Chenier toured extensively in North America and Europe, leading the Red Hot Louisiana Band and recording influential albums such as 'Bogalusa Boogie.' He won a Grammy Award in 1983 for 'I'm Here!' and was honored with a National Heritage Fellowship. Chenier’s legacy as the 'King of Zydeco' endures, having transformed Creole dance music into a vibrant, internationally recognized genre and inspiring generations of musicians[4][5].
