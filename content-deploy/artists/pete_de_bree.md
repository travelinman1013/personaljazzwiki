## Biography
Pete De Bree was an American rockabilly musician active in the late 1950s Detroit scene, best known as the pianist and bandleader of **Pete De Bree & The Wanderers**, a group that recorded for the influential independent label Fortune Records in Detroit, Michigan.[3][4][7] Although biographical details such as his birth date and early life are not documented in available sources, he is consistently identified with the Michigan rock and roll and rockabilly milieu, placing him within the first wave of post‑Elvis rock and roll performers emerging from the Midwest.[3][7]

De Bree’s work with The Wanderers blended driving rockabilly rhythms with honky‑tonk‑style piano and vocal performances typical of regional rock and roll acts of the period.[3][4][7] Fortune Records, known for its raw, unvarnished sound and roster of local talent, released several of the group’s recordings, including sides such as “Hey, Mr. Presley,” which explicitly referenced the rock and roll explosion of the era and connected De Bree’s output to the broader Presley‑led cultural shift.[4][7] Within the niche community of collectors and historians of 1950s rockabilly, Pete De Bree & The Wanderers are remembered as part of Detroit’s early contribution to rock and roll, but there is no evidence of a wider commercial breakthrough, extensive touring profile, or a documented later‑life legacy beyond these recordings.[3][4][7]

Because surviving documentation is sparse and mainly discographical, modern sources do not provide verified information regarding De Bree’s personal background, long‑term career trajectory, or influence on named later artists. His legacy today survives primarily through reissue projects, discography notes, and enthusiast sites that preserve his Fortune Records sides as examples of regional American rockabilly from the late 1950s.[3][4][7]

## Fun Facts
- Pete De Bree recorded for Fortune Records, a legendary Detroit independent label noted among collectors for its raw rock and roll, R&B, and gospel output rather than mainstream hits.[3][7]
- On the track “Hey, Mr. Presley,” Pete De Bree & The Wanderers explicitly name‑check Elvis Presley, reflecting how quickly early rockabilly artists were responding to and engaging with Presley’s cultural impact.[4]
- Enthusiast discography sources list Pete De Bree primarily as a pianist and bandleader rather than a guitarist, making him somewhat unusual among rockabilly figures, who were more commonly identified with guitar.[3][7]
