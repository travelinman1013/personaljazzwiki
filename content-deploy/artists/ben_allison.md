## Biography
Ben Allison is a bassist, composer, producer, and educator born in 1966 in New Haven, Connecticut, who has developed one of the most distinctive voices in contemporary jazz over a career spanning more than 30 years.[1][4] Known for his inspired arrangements, inventive grooves, and hummable melodies, Allison draws from the jazz tradition while seamlessly blending influences from rock, folk, 20th-century classical music, and world music into a cinematic, cohesive sound.[3][4] He first emerged on the New York jazz scene in the 1990s when he founded the Jazz Composers Collective, a musician-run, non-profit organization that became a mainstay of New York City's cultural life and drew international attention through its annual festival at the Jazz Standard.[2]

Throughout his career, Allison has established himself as a prolific recording artist and bandleader, releasing 19 albums as a main or featured artist, with 7 reaching #1 on the national jazz radio charts and earning him 9 SESAC Performance Awards.[2] He has appeared on over 100 albums by various artists and has written extensively for film, television, and radio, including the theme for the NPR show *On the Media* (which reaches over 2 million weekly listeners), the score for Donald Margulies' Pulitzer Prize-winning play *Two Days*, and the theme for Pharrell Williams' webcast talk show *The Conversation*.[4][6] His international reputation has been solidified through performances at prestigious venues including Carnegie Hall (where he made his debut as a leader in February 2012), the Newport Jazz Festival, North Sea Jazz Festival, London Jazz Festival, Walt Disney Concert Hall, and Queen Elizabeth Hall.[2]

Beyond his work as a performer and composer, Allison has been deeply committed to music education and artist development. Since 2011, he has taught at The New School's Contemporary and Performing Arts program, developing courses on jazz masters like Thelonious Monk and Wayne Shorter, as well as classes on entrepreneurship in music and socially engaged artistry.[1] He founded Sonic Camera Records and has produced or co-produced over 100 concerts and special events, including an ongoing residency at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.[2] His recognition includes multiple Downbeat Critics Poll nominations for both bassist and composer categories from 2010-2017.[2]
