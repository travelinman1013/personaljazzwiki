## Biography
Glen Campbell was born on April 22, 1936, into a large sharecropping family in Billstown, Arkansas, the seventh son of twelve children. He showed early musical talent, learning guitar by age four and performing locally with his uncle's band, the Gold Dust Brothers, before moving to Albuquerque, New Mexico, as a teenager to play in local clubs. In 1960, he relocated to Los Angeles, securing a job as a songwriter and demo recording artist, which led to his role as a premier session guitarist in the renowned Wrecking Crew studio collective. There, he contributed to landmark recordings for artists like the Beach Boys, Phil Spector, the Monkees, and Frank Sinatra, playing on hundreds of sessions, including 586 in 1963 alone, helping pioneer the 'Wall of Sound' production style.
