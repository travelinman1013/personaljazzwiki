## Biography
Jeanette Kimball was a pioneering American jazz pianist born on December 18, 1906, in Pass Christian, Mississippi, a town that regularly hosted New Orleans jazz bands traveling along the Gulf Coast. Raised in a strict Catholic family, Kimball's early exposure to music came from church, school events, and the jazz bands she heard parading through her town. She began piano lessons at a young age and was recognized as a prodigy, teaching her first lesson at age 11. Her formal entry into professional jazz came in 1926 when she joined Papa Celestin’s Tuxedo Jazz Orchestra, quickly becoming an indispensable member due to her mastery of melody, harmony, and transposition.

Kimball played with Celestin’s band through the late 1920s and early 1930s, recording and performing at high-profile events, including society balls and riverboat gigs. After stepping back in 1935 to raise her daughters, she continued to teach music and perform locally. She returned to the jazz scene in the late 1940s, playing with Buddy Charles and Herbert Leary’s bands, and rejoined Celestin’s orchestra in 1953, performing at the White House for President Eisenhower. After Celestin’s death, Kimball continued with the band under new leadership, touring internationally and becoming a fixture at Preservation Hall in New Orleans. Her style was noted for its rhythmic swing and versatility, blending traditional New Orleans jazz with broader influences. In 1980, she recorded her only album as a leader, 'Sophisticated Lady.'

Kimball’s career spanned more than seventy years, and she remained in demand well into her seventies, performing with groups like the Original Camellia Jazz Band and Kid Sheik’s band. She was recognized late in life with the Black Men of Labor Jazz Legacy Award in 1998. Kimball passed away on March 29, 2001, in Charleston, South Carolina, leaving a legacy as one of the most respected and innovative pianists in New Orleans jazz history.
