## Biography
Prey For Neighbors is a New Orleans-based alternative psych rock band formed in 2019 during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown as a creative outlet to cope with societal shutdown and feelings of isolation.[2][3][4] The band emerged from this period of global uncertainty, channeling those experiences into their music, though specific details on founding members or early development remain limited in available sources.[2][4] Their sound blends alternative rock with psychedelic elements, reflecting the introspective and experimental nature of their origins.[2][4]

Since their formation, Prey For Neighbors has maintained an active presence in the New Orleans music scene, releasing music via platforms like Bandcamp and performing locally, including shows with acts like Fantasy Non Fiction and Malevitus.[2][3] With low mainstream visibility—indicated by zero popularity on Spotify—the band represents the grassroots level of independent rock, focusing on local engagement rather than widespread commercial success.[CONTEXT] Their career is still developing, with no extensive discography or major milestones documented publicly as of early 2026.[3]

The band's legacy is tied to the pandemic era's DIY ethos, embodying resilience in underground music amid isolation. They continue to operate from New Orleans, contributing to the city's vibrant alternative scene without notable broader impact yet.[3][4]
