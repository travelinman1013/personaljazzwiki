## Biography
Johnny Vidacovich, born John Joseph Vidacovich Jr. on June 27, 1949, in New Orleans, Louisiana, is a cornerstone of the city’s jazz drumming tradition. Raised by his mother and grandparents, he began playing drums at age ten, soaking up the sounds of the French Quarter by listening outside nightclubs to local legends, an experience that deeply shaped his musical identity[3]. His early immersion in New Orleans’ rich musical culture—from Mardi Gras Indians to street parades—imbued his playing with the city’s signature syncopated backbeat, a style that has become his hallmark[2]. Vidacovich’s career took off in the 1970s as a founding member of Astral Project, a seminal contemporary jazz group that has performed for decades, blending avant-garde exploration with deep roots in New Orleans rhythm[1][2]. He has also been a faculty member at Loyola University New Orleans since 1982, passing on his knowledge to generations of drummers[1][2]. Over his six-decade career, Vidacovich has recorded and performed with a who’s who of jazz and blues, from Professor Longhair and James Booker to John Scofield and Bobby McFerrin, earning numerous awards including multiple 'Best Drummer' honors from OffBeat magazine and a Lifetime Achievement Award[1][2]. His style is noted for its fluidity, effortlessly shifting between jazz, blues, reggae, and street beats, always with a relaxed, unpretentious groove that epitomizes New Orleans sensibility[2]. Vidacovich’s legacy is not only as a performer but as a teacher and keeper of the city’s drumming traditions, ensuring that the 'second line' beat lives on in new generations[3].

## Fun Facts
- Johnny Vidacovich co-wrote the influential drum method book 'New Orleans and Second Line Drumming' with Herlin Riley, which became a staple in drum education[3].
- He is known for his weekly residency at the Maple Leaf Bar in New Orleans, where he can still be found playing on Thursday nights[4].
- Vidacovich began teaching at Loyola University New Orleans in 1982 and has mentored many of the city’s top drummers[1][2].
- Despite his deep roots in traditional New Orleans music, Vidacovich is equally comfortable in avant-garde jazz settings, as heard in Astral Project’s recordings[2].
