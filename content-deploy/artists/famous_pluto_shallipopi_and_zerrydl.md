## Biography
Famous Pluto, Shallipopi, and Zerrydl (often stylised Zerry DL) are three Nigerian brothers from Benin City, Edo State, who have collectively shaped a distinctive “Plutomania” sound within contemporary Afrobeats and amapiano‑leaning styles.[2][5][6][7][8] The siblings grew up in the same household in Benin City, with older brother Shallipopi first pursuing music in his teens and the younger brothers gradually following his path, initially through freestyle videos and social media content before transitioning into full‑fledged recording careers.[2][3][4][5][7] All three are signed to Shallipopi’s label, Plutomania Records, which has become the hub for their creative output and a symbol of their tight family and artistic bond.[2][4][5][7][8]

Zerrydl, born Divine Uzama on 4 December 2002 in Benin City, began sharing freestyles and covers on social media around 2015 and officially debuted with the single “Ifeoma” in 2022, later gaining major recognition in 2023 with the hit “Puff & Pass,” which entered the Nigeria TurnTable Top 100 and led to his debut EP *Danger Zee* on Plutomania Records.[2][4] Famous Pluto (Osahon Grandeur Uzama) is the youngest brother; he started as a dancer posting videos on TikTok and was initially reluctant to sing, but encouragement from his brothers—especially Shallipopi—and inspiration from Wizkid pushed him toward music, with a breakthrough feature on Outsyd DJ’s viral 2024 single “Feel D Mood,” followed by his own debut single “Na Scra,” released after signing to Plutomania Records in 2025.[3][5][7][8] Together with the already‑established Afrobeats star Shallipopi, the trio blend Afrobeats, amapiano, and street‑inflected afro‑fusion, emphasizing catchy hooks, dance‑ready rhythms, and a playful “Pluto” mythology that has attracted a wide Nigerian youth audience and solidified their status as an influential musical family unit.[2][3][4][5][7]

While each brother maintains a distinct musical identity—Zerrydl leaning into Afro‑rap and melodic street pop, Famous Pluto mixing Afrobeats with amapiano‑styled grooves, and Shallipopi anchoring the Plutomania sound with his signature Afrobeats street style—they are strongly interconnected through collaborations, label affiliation, and shared online origins.[1][2][3][4][5] Their collective legacy is emerging in the form of a recognizable family brand from Benin City, a model of sibling synergy where social‑media virality, independent label entrepreneurship, and cross‑pollinating Afro‑styles converge to create one of the most talked‑about young movements in Nigerian popular music.[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8]
