## Biography
Gonzalo Rubalcaba, born on May 27, 1963, in Havana, Cuba, is a celebrated jazz pianist and composer renowned for his ability to fuse Cuban musical traditions with American jazz. Raised in a distinguished musical family—his grandfather Jacobo Rubalcaba was a composer and bandleader, and his father Guillermo Rubalcaba was a pianist and composer—Gonzalo began playing drums at age six and switched to piano at eight, performing with his father’s band in Havana during his teens. He received formal classical training at the Amadeo Roldán and Manuel Saumell Conservatories and graduated with a degree in composition from the Havana Institute of Fine Arts.[1][2][4][7][8][9]

Rubalcaba’s career took a pivotal turn in 1985 when he was discovered by jazz legend Dizzy Gillespie, leading to collaborations with major figures like Charlie Haden and Paul Motian. He formed his own band, Grupo Proyecto, and began touring internationally, eventually settling in Miami in 1996 after stints in the Dominican Republic. Rubalcaba’s extensive discography includes acclaimed albums for Blue Note Records such as 'Discovery: Live at Montreux,' 'The Blessing,' 'Inner Voyage,' and the Grammy-winning 'Supernova.' His music is characterized by virtuosic technique, dense improvisations, and a distinctive blend of Afro-Cuban rhythms and modern jazz harmonies. Over his career, he has garnered multiple Grammy and Latin Grammy Awards and is widely regarded as one of the most influential jazz pianists of his generation.[1][2][3][4][5]

In addition to his performing and recording career, Rubalcaba is a respected educator, serving as a lecturer at the University of Miami’s Frost School of Music. His legacy is marked by his role in bridging Cuban and American jazz, inspiring a new generation of musicians, and contributing significantly to the global jazz landscape.[3][4]
