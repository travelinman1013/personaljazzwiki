## Biography
Elmo Williams and Hezekiah Early were both born and raised in the Natchez, Mississippi area, a region steeped in blues tradition. Elmo Williams, born Elmore Williams, Jr. on February 6, 1933, grew up in Fenwick before moving to Natchez as a child. His father, a blues guitarist, died when Elmo was just ten, leaving him to teach himself guitar by ear. Williams began performing at local gatherings as a teenager and, after a stint in the Army, returned to Natchez to play with bands led by John Fitzgerald, often performing at the legendary Haney’s Big House in Ferriday, Louisiana. Though he worked various day jobs, Williams remained a fixture in the local blues scene until the rise of riverboat casinos in the 1990s led him to step back from music. He returned to recording in the late 1990s, most notably collaborating with Hezekiah Early on the acclaimed album 'Takes One To Know One' (1998).

Hezekiah Early, born October 7, 1934, in Anna's Bottom near Natchez, was immersed in music from a young age, influenced by local fife and drum bands and his father, Wilson Early, a fife player. He learned to play multiple instruments and joined John Fitzgerald's band as a teenager, initially on harmonica and later on drums. Early became a central figure in the region's blues circuit, leading his own group, Hezekiah and the Houserockers, and serving as a house band at Haney’s Big House. He developed a unique performance style, simultaneously playing drums and harmonica, and continued to perform and record well into the 2000s, including international festival appearances. The partnership between Williams and Early brought together two authentic voices of Mississippi blues, celebrated for their raw, electrified juke joint sound and deep connection to the traditions of the Natchez area.
