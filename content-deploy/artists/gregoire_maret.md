## Biography
Grégoire Maret was born on May 13, 1975, in Geneva, Switzerland, and began playing the harmonica at age 17.[3][6] Growing up in French-speaking Switzerland, he was initially influenced by his father's collection of jazz classics, including Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington, later discovering Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, and John Coltrane during his high school years.[1] His passion for the harmonica was ignited after witnessing blues harmonica player Luther Allison perform at a concert, where he was mesmerized by the instrument's expressive capabilities.[1] At 18 years old, Maret moved to New York City to study at the New School University, beginning a transformative chapter in his musical career.[1][4]

Over the past two decades, Maret has emerged as a virtuoso harmonica player and composer who fundamentally redefined the instrument's role in modern jazz.[2] Herbie Hancock has praised him as "one of the most creative musicians around," while Marcus Miller noted that Maret is "carrying the instrument into the 21st century with prowess, passion, and creativity."[1] His collaborations span the highest echelons of jazz, including regular work with Herbie Hancock, Pat Metheny, Cassandra Wilson, and Marcus Miller.[2] Maret received a Grammy Award as a member of the Pat Metheny Group for Best Contemporary Jazz Album and earned a Grammy nomination for his 2020 album "Americana," a collaborative project with pianist Romain Collin and guitarist Bill Frisell that explored the roots of American music.[2]

Based in New York for the past 20 years, Maret has established himself as a phenomenon in the contemporary jazz world through his virtuoso technique and emotional interpretations.[2] His discography includes notable albums such as "Americana" (2020) and a tribute to composer Ennio Morricone, as well as "Harp vs. Harp," a collaborative project with Colombian harpist Edmar Castañeda that reimagined the possibilities of both instruments.[1][2] Maret's work exemplifies his commitment to exploring the musical depths of the American soul while maintaining the highest standards of instrumental artistry.
