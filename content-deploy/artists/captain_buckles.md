## Biography
Captain Buckles is a New Orleans-based funk, blues, rock, and soul band formed by a collective of veteran sidemen who transitioned from years of backing national and international touring acts into their own distinctive musical project. The band came together approximately two years before their 2025 debut album release, though the members had performed together in various lineups for years prior, working as first-call studio musicians and trusted backing players for artists including Eric Lindell, Samantha Fish, Russell Batiste, John "Papa" Gros, and Glen David Andrews. Their name derives from a 1971 album title track by legendary saxophonist David "Fathead" Newman, honoring the funky jazz traditions that inspire their sound.

The band's musical identity is deeply rooted in New Orleans' instrumental funk heritage, drawing inspiration from iconic acts like The Meters, Allman Brothers Band, The Band, Booker T & the MGs, and Little Feat. Their debut full-length album, *Hurry Up*, was recorded at the legendary Dockside Studio in Maurice, Louisiana—the same studio where Dr. John and B.B. King recorded—under the production guidance of engineer Justin Tocket and the band themselves. Released in November 2025 on cassette, digital download, and streaming services, the album showcases their signature blend of funky, organic instrumentals alongside soulful vocal tracks, demonstrating their commitment to musical exploration and dynamic subtlety. The band received support from the Threadhead Cultural Foundation Grant to complete the project, reflecting their importance to the New Orleans music community.

Captain Buckles represents a contemporary evolution of New Orleans' rich musical tradition, honoring the city's legacy while pushing forward with their own creative vision. Their music captures the spirit of late-night off-Bourbon Street clubs—down, dirty, and alive with the energy that has made New Orleans a birthplace of great musicians. The band's no-nonsense approach, emphasizing good vibes and an intense love of music, has established them as serious musicians worthy of attention in their own right, transitioning from the shadows of touring acts to the spotlight as leaders of their own ensemble.
