## Biography
Ben E. Hunter is an acclaimed singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist born in Treme and raised in the 7th Ward, two of New Orleans' most storied musical neighborhoods. Immersed from an early age in the city’s vibrant cultural traditions, Hunter developed a unique sound that fuses Afro-Caribbean folk, reggae, Black masking Indian chants, and West African rhythms, reflecting the deep historical connections between New Orleans and the Caribbean. His original songs explore the lived experiences and social realities of New Orleans, blending storytelling with a commitment to community and cultural preservation.

Hunter’s career spans over two decades, during which he has become a fixture in the New Orleans music scene. He is best known for his pioneering reggae performances at Café Brazil on Frenchmen Street and as the leader of bands such as Plantation Posse and Ben Hunter & Crucial Roots. His discography includes at least nine studio albums, with notable works like "Voodoo Reggae," "Reality Check," "Soul Avenger Live Intergalactic," and "A Freedom Song." Hunter has headlined at iconic venues including Tipitina’s, House of Blues, Snug Harbor, and the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, where he performed for eight consecutive years. Internationally, he has appeared at Reggae Sunsplash in Jamaica and was a headliner for the Bob Marley Festival Tour for five years.

After being diagnosed with epilepsy, Hunter took a decade-long hiatus from music but has since returned, fully recovered and seizure-free, bringing a renewed perspective and a fresh sound to his work. His music continues to inspire and influence, celebrated for its powerful conviction, innovative blending of genres, and deep roots in New Orleans' cultural legacy.
