## Biography
Matt Perrine, a California native, was an accomplished trombonist, bassist (upright and electric), and arranger by age twelve, performing with the Artie Shaw Orchestra and other jazz luminaries before high school graduation. Relocating to New Orleans in 1992, he became a staple in the city's music scene as a virtuoso sousaphone, tuba, upright, and electric bass player, spanning genres like jazz, Dixieland, funk, brass band, and avant-garde. Debbie Davis, born January 5, 1974, in Queens, New York, is a performer and actress known for roles in Nine Lives: A Musical Adaptation Live (2011) and HBO's Treme (2010-2013), where she appeared as herself. The couple married on September 6, 1998, and have two children, frequently collaborating on musical projects.[1][3]

Together, Perrine and Davis released the holiday album Oh Crap, It's Christmas! in 2014, which achieved critical and popular success. Perrine co-founded the New Orleans Nightcrawlers as tubist, chief composer, and arranger, releasing albums like Sunflower City (2007, named Best CD by WWOZ-FM) and Bayou Road Suite (2010) with his Sunflower City Band, and is a founding member of the Tin Men. DownBeat magazine praises him as a 'virtuoso sousaphone player.' Davis performs alongside him, as seen in joint renditions like 'Dream A Little Dream.' They contribute to New Orleans' vibrant music culture through performances, recordings, and Perrine's educational work with programs like New Orleans Young Audiences and international jazz clinics.[2][3][5]

Perrine's legacy includes innovations in brass band music, crowd-funded releases via Threadhead Records, and global performances from the Sydney Opera House to European festivals. As an educator and clinician, he has been commissioned by Danish conservatories. The duo's partnership blends music and performance, sustaining New Orleans traditions while reaching broader audiences through TV and recordings.[3][7]
