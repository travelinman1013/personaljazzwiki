## Biography
Laurindo Almeida (1917–1995) was a Brazilian virtuoso guitarist and composer who played a pivotal role in bridging classical, jazz, and Latin music. Born in Prainha near Santos in São Paulo, Brazil, into a musical family, Almeida was a self-taught guitarist. By his teenage years, he was already working as a radio artist, staff arranger, and nightclub performer in São Paulo. At 19, he traveled to Europe as a guitarist in a cruise ship orchestra, where a Paris performance by Django Reinhardt and Stéphane Grappelli left a lasting impression and deeply influenced his artistic direction.

Almeida moved to the United States in the late 1940s after being discovered by Stan Kenton in Rio de Janeiro. He became a featured guitarist in Kenton's band, gaining recognition for blending his Latin American roots with modern jazz. In the 1950s, Almeida formed his own groups and, with saxophonist Bud Shank, recorded the landmark 'Brazilliance' albums, which anticipated the bossa nova sound by nearly a decade. Almeida's career was marked by versatility: he recorded over a hundred albums, won five Grammy Awards (four in classical, one in jazz), and collaborated with major jazz and classical figures. He was also a prolific studio musician, contributing to over 800 film soundtracks. His innovative approach to fusing Brazilian rhythms with jazz and classical forms left an indelible mark on 20th-century music.
