## Biography
The World Saxophone Quartet was an American jazz ensemble founded in 1976-1977 that became one of the most commercially and critically successful avant-garde jazz groups of its era.[1][2] The group originated when Ed Jordan, chairman of the Music Department at Southern University in New Orleans, invited four accomplished saxophonists—Julius Hemphill, Oliver Lake, Hamiet Bluiett, and David Murray—to conduct a series of clinics and performances together.[1][2] Three of these musicians (Hemphill, Lake, and Bluiett) were already acquainted from the vibrant St. Louis jazz scene of the 1960s and early 1970s, where they had worked together as members of the Black Artists' Group.[2][3] The enthusiastic audience response to their unaccompanied saxophone performances convinced the musicians to formalize the concept, and they began performing at venues like the Tin Palace in New York City, initially calling themselves the Real New York Saxophone Quartet before changing their name to the World Saxophone Quartet to avoid legal conflict with a preexisting group of the same name.[1][2]

Musically, the World Saxophone Quartet distinguished itself by melding jazz-based, harmonically adventurous improvisation with sophisticated composition, incorporating elements of free jazz, R&B, funk, and South African jazz into their distinctive sound.[1][3] All four original members were accomplished composers and improvisers who drew inspiration from post-bop and free jazz pioneers including Albert Ayler, Anthony Braxton, Steve Lacy, Cecil Taylor, Ornette Coleman, and Eric Dolphy.[2] The group released their debut album, *Point of No Return*, in 1977 on the Moers Music label, an almost completely improvised effort that established their experimental credentials.[1] By the time they signed with Elektra/Musician in 1986, the band had evolved into a well-rehearsed, compositionally sophisticated ensemble. Their 1986 album *Plays Duke Ellington* was named among the year's best albums by the New York Times and earned them recognition as "the most original and important group to emerge since Miles Davis, Ornette Coleman and John Coltrane redefined group improvisation in the late 1950s."[1][4]

The group's lineup remained stable until Julius Hemphill's departure in 1990 due to illness (he died in 1995), after which several saxophonists filled his alto chair, including Arthur Blythe (1990-1992, 1994-1995), James Spaulding (1993), Eric Person (1993-1996), and finally John Purcell, who became the permanent replacement in 1996.[1][2][3] Throughout their career, despite being primarily a saxophone-oriented ensemble, the World Saxophone Quartet incorporated a wide variety of woodwinds and later collaborated with drummers, bassists, and other musicians, establishing themselves as a powerhouse repertory band that toured extensively throughout the United States, Europe, and Japan.[1][4]

## Fun Facts
- The group was originally called the 'Real New York Saxophone Quartet' when they performed at the Tin Palace in New York City, but were forced to change their name after reportedly being threatened with a lawsuit by a preexisting group called the New York Saxophone Quartet, leading to their now-famous name: the World Saxophone Quartet.[1]
- The group's signature tune 'Hattie Wall,' composed by Hamiet Bluiett, was so iconic that it was adapted into a music video directed by renowned filmmaker Robert Longo.[4]
- Despite being an avant-garde free jazz group, the World Saxophone Quartet achieved the rare distinction of securing a major-label record deal with Elektra/Musician in the 1980s—an almost unheard-of occurrence for retro-jazz and experimental music during that decade.[1]
- Jon Pareles of the New York Times described the World Saxophone Quartet as 'the most original and important group to emerge since Miles Davis, Ornette Coleman and John Coltrane redefined group improvisation in the late 1950s,' and the group was named 'Best Jazz Group' by Playboy magazine's Reader's Poll in 1987.[2][4]
