## Biography
Jean Knight, born Jean Caliste on June 26, 1943, in New Orleans, Louisiana, began her musical journey singing in her cousin's bar, 'Laura's Place,' in the Crescent City. Early on, she recorded several singles locally, eventually changing her last name to Knight for broader appeal. Despite her local reputation, she spent the late 1960s working as a baker at Loyola University, with her music career stalled.

Her breakthrough came in 1970 when producer Wardell Quezergue invited her to record at Malaco Studio in Jackson, Mississippi. The result was 'Mr. Big Stuff,' a playful soul track that initially struggled to find a label but was eventually picked up by Stax Records. Released in 1971, the song soared to No. 1 on the R&B charts and No. 2 on the pop charts, earning Knight a Grammy nomination and cementing her place in soul music history. Although subsequent releases did not match the success of 'Mr. Big Stuff,' Knight continued recording for various labels, notably covering the zydeco hit 'My Toot Toot.'

Knight's style blends classic soul, Motown, and funk, characterized by her assertive vocals and witty lyricism. She toured with disco and soul legends like Donna Summer and Gloria Gaynor, and remained a fixture in New Orleans' music scene, performing regularly at the Jazz and Heritage Festival. Her legacy endures as an emblem of Southern soul, and her signature hit remains a staple of the genre.
