## Biography
The Pretenders are a British-American rock band formed in March 1978 in London by American-born Chrissie Hynde, who moved from Akron, Ohio to London in 1973. Before forming the Pretenders, Hynde immersed herself in London's punk and new wave scene, working at the music paper NME and at Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood's clothes store, while becoming involved with early versions of the Sex Pistols, the Clash, and the Damned. She assembled the original Pretenders lineup with lead guitarist James Honeyman-Scott, bassist Pete Farndon, and drummer Martin Chambers, all from the United Kingdom. The band's debut album, released in January 1980, became the first UK number one album of the decade and established them as major forces in post-punk rock with their innovative songwriting and raw, stripped-down instrumentation rooted in new wave aesthetics.

The band's early success was marked by critical and commercial hits including "Stop Your Sobbing" (1979), "Kid" (1979), and "Brass in Pocket" (1980), which reached No. 1 in the UK and No. 14 on the Billboard Hot 100. However, the band was devastated by the drug-related deaths of Honeyman-Scott in 1982 and Farndon in 1983, which could have ended their career. Instead, Hynde and Chambers persevered, recruiting guitarist Robbie McIntosh and bassist Malcolm Foster to record their third album, Learning to Crawl (1984), which became their most commercially successful release and featured iconic hits like "Back on the Chain Gang" (which reached No. 5 in the US), "Middle of the Road," and "2000 Miles." Throughout their four-plus decade career spanning 12 albums, Chrissie Hynde has remained the sole constant member, establishing the Pretenders as a testament to artistic resilience and enduring songwriting excellence in rock music.

## Fun Facts
- Chrissie Hynde named the band 'The Pretenders' after 'The Great Pretender,' a 1955 hit by The Platters that was the favorite song of one of her former boyfriends.
- The B-side of 'Middle of the Road,' titled '2000 Miles,' became the theme music for The Rush Limbaugh Show from its inception (except for a few weeks in July and August 1999).
- The Pretenders' debut album, released in January 1980, was the first UK number one album of the entire decade and achieved critical acclaim across Europe, the US, and Australia.
- After the deaths of two founding members within 18 months (Honeyman-Scott in 1982 and Farndon in 1983), the band could have disbanded, but Hynde's determination to preserve the original music led to the formation of a new lineup that produced their most commercially successful album, Learning to Crawl (1984).
