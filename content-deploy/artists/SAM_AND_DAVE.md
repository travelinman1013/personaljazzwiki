## Biography
Sam & Dave, the iconic soul duo composed of Sam Moore (born October 12, 1935, Miami, Florida) and Dave Prater (born May 9, 1937, Ocilla, Georgia), emerged as one of the most electrifying live acts of the 1960s, earning nicknames like 'Double Dynamite,' 'The Sultans of Sweat,' and 'The Dynamic Duo' for their high-energy performances[1][2][4]. Both grew up singing in church—Moore in Miami with groups like The Majestics and The Mellonaires, and Prater in Georgia before joining The Sensational Hummingbirds in Miami[2][7]. Their paths crossed in 1961 at Miami’s King of Hearts club, where a serendipitous onstage mishap during an audition led to their first impromptu duet and the birth of their partnership[2]. Initially recording for Roulette Records with modest regional success, their career trajectory changed when Atlantic Records executive Jerry Wexler signed them and sent them to Memphis’s Stax Records, where they were paired with the songwriting-production team of Isaac Hayes and David Porter and backed by the legendary house band Booker T. & the M.G.’s[1][3][6]. At Stax, Sam & Dave perfected a gritty, gospel-infused sound that became synonymous with the Memphis Soul movement, scoring major hits like 'Hold On! I’m a Comin’' (1966), 'When Something Is Wrong with My Baby' (1967), and their signature 'Soul Man' (1967), which reached number two on the pop charts[3][4]. Despite their professional chemistry, the duo’s personal relationship was famously strained, and they officially parted ways in 1970, though they reunited periodically through 1981[3][4]. Sam & Dave’s influence endured well beyond their active years, especially after 'Soul Man' was popularized anew by The Blues Brothers in the late 1970s[3][4]. Inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1992, their legacy as pioneers who bridged gospel, soul, and pop for diverse audiences remains unchallenged[3][6].
