## Biography
The M&N Singers were a gospel group active primarily during the 1970s, known for their contributions to the American gospel and soul soundtrack genres. The group included Reverend John Wilkins, who performed and toured with the ensemble before embarking on a solo career as a preacher and musician. Their music reflected the rich traditions of Southern gospel, blending spirituals with elements of soul and rhythm & blues, and was influential in shaping the sound of contemporary gospel during their era.[5]

Emerging from the American South, the M&N Singers performed at churches, festivals, and regional events, building a reputation for heartfelt performances and tight vocal harmonies. Their repertoire featured both original compositions and traditional gospel standards, often characterized by uplifting lyrics and dynamic arrangements. The group’s legacy is closely tied to the regional history of gospel music, serving as a bridge between older spiritual traditions and modern gospel expressions.[5]

The M&N Singers' impact extended beyond their active years, as members such as Reverend John Wilkins continued to influence the genre through solo work and mentorship. Their recordings remain sought after by collectors and enthusiasts of classic gospel soundtracks, and their style has been cited as an inspiration by later generations of gospel musicians.
