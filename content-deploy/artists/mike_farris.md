## Biography
Mike Farris is a Grammy Award-winning American musician and vocalist known for his powerful blend of blues, gospel, and soul music. Born and raised in Tennessee, Farris began his professional music career at age nineteen after answering a newspaper advertisement for a soul singer, which led him to become the frontman of Screamin' Cheetah Wheelies, a southern rock band signed to Atlantic Records in the early 1990s. The band achieved significant success and toured internationally, but Farris' struggle with drug and alcohol addiction—which began at age fifteen—prevented him from reaching his full potential during this period. His career was marked by both tremendous opportunity and personal turmoil, including a stint as lead vocalist for Stevie Ray Vaughan's legendary blues band Double Trouble, yet his addictions ultimately left him homeless and living in his car in Knoxville, Tennessee.[1][2]

In 2005, at a pivotal moment standing at his nephew's grave site, Farris made the decision to get sober and redirect his life. He pursued healing through the music that had always moved him most: traditional black spirituals and gospel music. Encouraged by his longtime manager Rose McGathy, Farris began recording his own interpretations of these spirituals, which led to his solo career breakthrough. His dedication to this musical journey resulted in critical acclaim and numerous prestigious awards, including an Americana Music Award for New & Emerging Artist in 2008, a Dove Award for Traditional Gospel Album of the Year in 2010, and most notably, a Grammy Award in 2015 for Best Roots Gospel Album for his Kickstarter-funded project 'Shine For All The People'.[1][2]

Throughout his career, Farris has performed at major festivals including Bonnaroo, South by Southwest, Austin City Limits Festival, Hardly Strictly Bluegrass, and the Hollywood Bowl, as well as prestigious venues like the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and TED-x Nashville. His music seamlessly blends blues, country, gospel, and soul traditions, drawing comparisons to legendary vocalists like Sam Cooke and Otis Redding. Despite experiencing a relapse with pain medications in the years following his initial sobriety, Farris sought comprehensive rehabilitation and counseling to address the root causes of his addiction. His artistic journey—marked by personal redemption, musical evolution, and unwavering commitment to his craft—has established him as a respected figure in American roots music with a distinctive vocal delivery and profound storytelling ability.[2][3][4]
