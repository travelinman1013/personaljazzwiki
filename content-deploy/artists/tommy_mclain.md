## Biography
Tommy McLain was born on March 15, 1940, in Jonesville, Louisiana, a rural area in the east-central portion of the state.[2][4] Raised in Pineville, Louisiana, McLain was immersed in music from an early age, influenced by the New Orleans sounds of Fats Domino, Little Richard, and Larry Williams.[4] He began playing bass guitar at age five and first started singing at family parties.[3] In high school, he formed his own band and later worked as a disc jockey at the Oakdale radio station KREH.[3][4] McLain's early career saw him performing with country singer Clint West, with whom he was a member of The Vel-Tones in the late 1950s and the Boogie Kings in the 1960s.[2]

McLain achieved his greatest fame with his 1966 recording of "Sweet Dreams," a swamp pop cover that reached No. 15 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart, No. 7 in Canada, and No. 49 in the UK Singles Chart.[2] The song's success came after producer Floyd Soileau discovered McLain performing as a bass player with Clint West and the Boogie Kings, leading to a re-recording that finally captured the magic Soileau had been seeking.[1] Following this breakthrough, McLain appeared on Dick Clark's "Where the Action Is" television show and toured with Clark's "Caravan of Stars," sharing stages with rock and soul legends including Otis Redding, the Byrds, Gary Lewis and the Playboys, the Yardbirds, and Bobby Vinton.[1][2] He also wrote Freddy Fender's hit single "If You Don't Love Me Alone (Leave Me Alone)" and appeared in the Paul Newman film "The Drowning Pool."[2]

After his national career declined in 1968, McLain regrouped in the early 1970s, forming his Mule Train Band and establishing himself as a regional attraction throughout Louisiana and Texas.[1] He recorded numerous singles for Meaux's Crazy Cajun label and released the album "Backwoods Bayou Adventure" via Epic Records in 1979.[1] In 2007, McLain was inducted into the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame.[2] A remarkable late-career resurgence occurred when, in 2019, he brought new material to South by Southwest Music Festival and secured a recording contract with Decca Records in England.[1] On August 26, 2022, McLain released his first album in over 40 years, "I Ran Down Every Dream," a collaboration featuring 11 original songs with co-writes and contributions from Elvis Costello, Nick Lowe, Jon Cleary, and numerous other acclaimed musicians.[2] Tommy McLain passed away on July 24, 2025, at the age of 85.[1][2]

- Despite his national career essentially ending in 1968, McLain continued performing six nights a week throughout Louisiana and Texas for decades, maintaining a dedicated regional following and collaborating with top-flight regional musicians.[5]
