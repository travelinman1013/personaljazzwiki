## Biography
Steven Ellison, known professionally as Flying Lotus, was born on October 7, 1983, in Los Angeles, California, into a legendary musical family as the great-nephew of jazz icon John Coltrane and cousin to saxophonist Ravi Coltrane. Growing up inspired by 1990s West Coast rap, particularly G-funk blending programming and live instrumentation, as well as producers like J Dilla, Madlib, and Dabrye, Ellison began producing spacey hip-hop beats in his bedroom using the Akai MPC sampler. After a brief stint in the Bay Area, he returned to Los Angeles in 2004, interning at Stones Throw Records under Peanut Butter Wolf, which allowed him to connect with his idols. His music gained early traction when tracks were licensed by Adult Swim, leading to his official debut as Flying Lotus in 2006 with the album *1983* on Plug Research, named after his birth year.[1][3]
