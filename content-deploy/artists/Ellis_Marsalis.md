## Biography
Ellis Louis Marsalis Jr. (November 14, 1934 – April 1, 2020) was a highly influential American jazz pianist, composer, and educator, widely regarded as the patriarch of the Marsalis musical family. Born and raised in New Orleans, Louisiana, Marsalis began his formal music studies at age eleven and later graduated from Dillard University with a degree in music education. He initially played both tenor saxophone and piano before focusing on piano, performing locally and serving as a band director after college. Marsalis honed his skills further during a stint in the U.S. Marine Corps, performing on military television and radio shows before returning to New Orleans to immerse himself in the city’s jazz scene.[1][5][6][8]

Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, Marsalis collaborated with notable musicians such as Ed Blackwell, Cannonball Adderley, Nat Adderley, and Al Hirt, but he became best known for his dedication to jazz education. He taught at the New Orleans Center for Creative Arts, Xavier University of Louisiana, and the University of New Orleans, where he founded the Jazz Studies program. Marsalis’s teaching philosophy emphasized both historical understanding and personal discovery in jazz, and he mentored a generation of musicians who would go on to shape the genre. Despite his devotion to teaching, he recorded nearly twenty albums as a leader and appeared on many others, earning recognition for his modern, exploratory approach to jazz piano.[1][6][7][8]

Marsalis’s legacy is profound—not only as a performer but as a mentor to countless artists, including his own sons Wynton, Branford, Delfeayo, and Jason, all of whom became prominent jazz musicians. He received numerous honors, including induction into the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame, the NEA Jazz Masters Award (with his sons), and a posthumous Grammy Trustees Award. The Ellis Marsalis Center for Music in New Orleans stands as a testament to his enduring impact on jazz and music education.[1][7][8]
