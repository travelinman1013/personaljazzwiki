## Biography
Sabine McCalla is a Haitian-American singer-songwriter whose music bridges genres and generations, drawing deeply from gospel, folk, soul, blues, and Americana. Born and raised in New York City to Haitian immigrant parents, McCalla grew up surrounded by a diverse array of musical influences, from Motown and girl groups to Bob Marley, the Beatles, and Haitian folk songs. Her early exposure to classical violin and chamber music further broadened her musical palette, fostering an appreciation for the connections between different musical traditions.

McCalla's career took root in New Orleans, where she was drawn by the city’s rich musical heritage and vibrant culture. She began performing in local backyards and small venues, quickly becoming a fixture in the local scene and collaborating with notable musicians. Her songwriting is characterized by intimate storytelling, honest lyricism, and a blend of genres that reflect both her Haitian heritage and the multicultural fabric of New Orleans. Her debut album, 'Don't Call Me Baby' (2023), showcases this eclecticism, weaving together elements of Brazilian samba, southern soul, British rock, folk, and country. The album’s themes range from joy and heartbreak to gender inequality and cultural celebration, positioning McCalla as a bridge-builder between tradition and innovation.

McCalla’s music has resonated with audiences in New Orleans and beyond, earning her features on Spotify editorial playlists and opportunities to tour nationally. Her work is marked by a therapeutic approach to storytelling, often reflecting on periods of isolation and personal growth, such as during the pandemic. As the younger sister of acclaimed musician Leyla McCalla, Sabine continues to expand her creative horizons, collaborating with a range of artists and contributing to the evolving legacy of American roots music.
