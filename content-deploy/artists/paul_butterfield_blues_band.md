## Biography
The Paul Butterfield Blues Band, formed in Chicago in the early 1960s by harmonica virtuoso Paul Butterfield, was a pioneering force in the fusion of electric Chicago blues and rock. Raised in Chicago, Butterfield was exposed to the city’s vibrant blues scene from a young age, initially studying classical flute before teaching himself harmonica. He became a fixture in South Side clubs, sitting in with legends like Muddy Waters and Otis Rush, and was one of the first white musicians to be accepted into the Black blues community during a racially divided era[1][2][3].

The band’s original lineup included keyboardist Mark Naftalin, guitarist Elvin Bishop, guitarist Mike Bloomfield, bassist Jerome Arnold, and drummer Sam Lay. Their 1965 debut album on Elektra Records brought blues to a broader, racially mixed audience, and their electrifying performances at venues like the Newport Folk Festival (where they famously backed Bob Dylan’s first electric set) and Woodstock cemented their reputation. The band’s innovative blend of blues, rock, jazz, and even Indian raga—most notably on their influential album 'East-West'—helped define the American blues-rock movement and inspired countless musicians[1][2][3][4].

Despite lineup changes and Butterfield’s personal struggles, the band’s impact endured. They were among the first racially integrated blues groups, and their work played a crucial role in popularizing blues among white audiences. Paul Butterfield and his band were inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame (2006) and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (2015), recognized for their groundbreaking musicianship and cultural significance[2][3].
