## Biography
Mary Esther Wells was born on May 13, 1943, in Detroit, Michigan, and overcame significant hardships in her early life, including a bout of spinal meningitis that left her temporarily paralyzed, partially blind in one eye, and with hearing loss. Raised by her mother, who worked as a domestic servant, Wells began singing in church and local clubs from a young age, displaying both vocal and songwriting talent. By her teens, she was performing in Detroit-area clubs and writing her own material.

At just 17, Wells approached Motown founder Berry Gordy with a song she had written for Jackie Wilson. Impressed by her voice, Gordy signed her to Motown in 1960, making her one of the label’s first female stars. Her debut single, "Bye Bye Baby," became a hit, and with the guidance of Smokey Robinson, she produced a string of successful singles, including "The One Who Really Loves You," "You Beat Me to the Punch," and "Two Lovers." In 1964, she released "My Guy," which reached #1 on the US pop charts and became her signature song, breaking the Beatles’ hold on the charts at the time.

Wells' musical style blended Motown’s pop sensibilities with soulful, intimate vocals, and she was known for her smooth, knowing delivery. As Motown’s first female superstar, she paved the way for later acts like the Supremes and inspired a generation of soul singers. After leaving Motown in 1964, she continued to record for other labels, but never matched her earlier commercial success. Despite her career’s ups and downs, Wells’ legacy as the "Queen of Motown" and a foundational figure in soul and pop music endures.
