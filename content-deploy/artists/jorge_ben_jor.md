## Biography
Jorge Duílio Lima Menezes, known professionally as Jorge Ben Jor, was born on March 22, 1939, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Raised in a musically rich household, he sang in the church choir as a child and initially aspired to become a professional footballer, even playing briefly for Clube de Regatas do Flamengo. When his football career did not materialize, he turned to music, performing in Rio’s Copacabana clubs, where he was discovered by a record producer and signed to Philips. His debut single, 'Mas, Que Nada!' (1963), became an instant classic, launching his career and leading to his first album, 'Samba Esquema Novo.'

Ben Jor’s musical style is distinguished by its innovative fusion of samba with elements of bossa nova, funk, rock, and jazz, a blend that would later be known as 'samba rock.' Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, he played a pivotal role in the evolution of Brazilian popular music (MPB), contributing to major movements such as bossa nova, Jovem Guarda, and Tropicália. His albums, including 'Força Bruta' (1970), are considered milestones in Brazilian music. Ben Jor’s rhythmic guitar work, soulful vocals, and inventive songwriting have earned him recognition as one of the most influential Brazilian artists, with Rolling Stone Brazil naming him the fifth greatest Brazilian musical artist of all time.

Jorge Ben Jor’s legacy extends far beyond his own recordings. His songs have been covered by international artists, and his influence is evident in generations of Brazilian musicians. He has received numerous accolades, including a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Latin Recording Academy. His enduring appeal is reflected in the continued popularity of his music, both in Brazil and internationally, with hits like 'Mas, Que Nada!' remaining staples of global music culture.
