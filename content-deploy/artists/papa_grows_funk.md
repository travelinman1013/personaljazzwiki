## Biography
John 'Papa' Gros, born in New Orleans and raised partly in Baton Rouge, immersed himself in the city's musical culture from a young age, attending Loyola University in New Orleans where he embraced the local lifestyle and classics like 'Iko Iko.' His career began playing weddings and cover bands on Bourbon Street before joining George Porter Jr.'s Runnin' Pardners in the 1990s as a keyboardist, earning what he calls a 'doctorate' from the Meters bassist who provided a blueprint for New Orleans funk. In early 2000, Gros formed Papa Grows Funk from Monday night jam sessions at New Orleans' Maple Leaf Bar and Old Point Bar in Algiers, blending funk, jazz funk, funk rock, and jam band elements into a high-energy gumbo that drew crowds for its smooth jazz sophistication and Mardi Gras wildness[1][2][3].

The band became a New Orleans institution, holding a 13-year Monday night residency at the Maple Leaf Bar, releasing six critically acclaimed albums including 'Needle in the Groove' co-produced by Allen Toussaint, and touring worldwide to spread Big Easy funk before disbanding in 2013. Captured in the documentary 'Do U Want It?', their story highlights their supergroup status with ties to Meters alumni. Post-band, Gros continued as a sideman for artists like Better Than Ezra, Anders Osborne, and Bonerama, performed in tributes to Dr. John and the Neville Brothers, and pursued solo work starting with his 2004 album 'Day's End,' honoring New Orleans traditions while innovating across funk, rock, jazz, blues, and Americana[2][3][4][5].

Gros's legacy lies in carrying forward the joyous, celebratory music of New Orleans legends like Professor Longhair, Dr. John, and the Nevilles, regularly tributing Dr. John at Tipitina's with songs spanning his Night Tripper era to hits like 'Such a Night.' As a bandleader, frontman, singer, and instrumentalist, he adds to the city's history, nurturing its self-sustaining musical lineage[2][3].
