## Biography
Austin Pitre (February 23, 1918 – April 8, 1981) was a pioneering Cajun accordionist and bandleader born in Ville Platte, Louisiana. Raised in a musical family, Pitre received his first accordion at age six from his father and was performing at local dances by age eleven. His early exposure to the vibrant Cajun music scene of southern Louisiana shaped his energetic and theatrical style, which became his trademark throughout his career.[1][2]

In 1940, Pitre formed the Evangeline Playboys, a group that would become synonymous with the golden era of Cajun dancehall music. He was renowned for his flamboyant stage presence, famously playing the accordion standing up—often behind his head or between his knees, and without a shoulder strap—at a time when most musicians played seated. Pitre’s recordings with Swallow Records from the late 1950s through the 1970s, including classics like “Opelousas Waltz” and “Les Flammes d’Enfer,” helped define the sound of modern Cajun music, blending traditional rhythms with new instrumentation such as drums and steel guitar.[1][2][3][4]

Pitre’s influence extended beyond Louisiana, with performances at national events like the Smithsonian Festival of American Folk Life and the Newport Folk Festival. He was honored at the Louisiana Freedom Festival in 1980 for his five decades of musical contributions and was posthumously inducted into the Cajun French Music Association Hall of Fame in 1997. His legacy endures in the repertoire of Cajun standards and in the showmanship and innovation he brought to the genre.[1][2][3][4]
