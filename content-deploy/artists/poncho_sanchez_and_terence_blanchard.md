## Biography
Poncho Sanchez, born in 1951 in Laredo, Texas, as the youngest of 11 children in a Mexican-American family, moved to Los Angeles where he immersed himself in the local music scene, playing in clubs and developing his conga skills. At age 24 in 1975, he joined Cal Tjader's band, a pivotal moment that shaped his career in Latin jazz; he stayed until Tjader's death in 1982, forming his own group in 1980 and recording early albums. Signing with Concord Picante in 1982 on Tjader's recommendation, Sanchez released 18 albums, won a Grammy for *Latin Soul* in 1999, and became a torchbearer for Latin jazz innovators like Mongo Santamaria, Tito Puente, and Tjader, blending straightahead jazz, soul, and Latin rhythms from congas and percussion.[1][4][10]

Terence Blanchard, born March 13, 1962, in New Orleans, Louisiana, as an only child, began trumpet studies early and launched his career in 1980 with the Lionel Hampton Orchestra while at Rutgers University. In 1982, Wynton Marsalis recommended him to replace himself in Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers, where he served as lead soloist and musical director until 1986, then co-led a quintet with Donald Harrison, recording seven albums. Blanchard transitioned to film composing with over 80 scores, including Academy-nominated works for Spike Lee films, composed operas like *Fire Shut Up in My Bones* (Metropolitan Opera premiere 2021), and explored Latin jazz through collaborations, maintaining a style rooted in jazz innovation and New Orleans heritage.[2][5]

Together, Sanchez and Blanchard collaborated on the 2011 Concord album *Chano y Dizzy!*, tributing Dizzy Gillespie and Chano Pozo's Afro-Cuban jazz innovations, with Blanchard on trumpet embodying Gillespie's role and Sanchez on congas channeling Pozo. Their shared Latin jazz passion—Blanchard as a lifelong fan—produced a Grammy-nominated work highlighting multicultural jazz fusion, cementing their legacies in preserving and evolving the genre through performances and recordings.[2][3][4][6]
