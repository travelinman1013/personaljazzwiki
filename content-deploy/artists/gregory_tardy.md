## Biography
Gregory Tardy was born on February 3, 1966, in New Orleans, Louisiana, into a deeply musical family where both parents were opera singers, with his mother later pursuing a jazz singing career. He began his musical journey as an award-winning classical clarinetist, studying at Carroll College, the University of Wisconsin, and the Wisconsin Conservatory of Music. However, in his early twenties while preparing for a symphony career, Tardy discovered jazz saxophone and made the pivotal transition to that instrument, a shift he describes as painful but ultimately transformative. To support his education, he played tenor saxophone in funk and fusion bands, and after meeting Ellis Marsalis in St. Louis, he became a devoted student of the patriarch of the famous Marsalis family, eventually relocating to New Orleans with minimal financial resources where he performed on street corners to sustain himself.

Tardy's professional breakthrough came in 1992 when he recorded his debut album "Crazy Love" and began playing with the legendary Elvin Jones Jazz Machine under the direction of Nicholas Payton. Playing nightly with one of jazz's greatest drummers proved to be a high-pressure crucible that significantly developed his consistency and musicianship. This experience catapulted his career forward, leading to his 1998 Impulse! Records debut "Serendipity" and subsequent collaborations with jazz luminaries including Wynton Marsalis, Tom Harrell, Dave Douglas, Andrew Hill, and numerous other prominent artists. Over his career, Tardy has recorded more than fifteen albums under his own name across multiple labels including SteepleChase Records, J Curve Records, Palmetto Records, and WJ3 Records, while also appearing on Grammy-winning and Grammy-nominated recordings.

Beyond his performing career, Tardy has established himself as an accomplished educator and composer, currently serving as an associate professor of jazz saxophone at the University of Tennessee–Knoxville. Known for his versatility across hard bop and bebop styles, he has performed at major jazz festivals worldwide and conducted master classes and clinics. His journey from classical training through jazz discovery to becoming a respected bandleader and educator exemplifies dedication to artistic excellence and continuous musical growth.

## Fun Facts
- Tardy's transition from classical clarinet to jazz saxophone was so dramatic that people who knew him as a classical musician were shocked when they heard him play jazz years later, unable to believe how serious and accomplished he had become in the new genre.
- To support himself while studying jazz in New Orleans after meeting Ellis Marsalis, Tardy played on street corners and literally passed the hat to make ends meet, demonstrating extraordinary dedication to his musical transformation.
- Playing every night with Elvin Jones in the Jazz Machine was so intense that Tardy describes it as 'like running in front of a steam roller—either you stay with the flow or you get run over,' an experience that fundamentally shaped his consistency as a musician.
- Tardy's parents, Melvin and Joann, retired to Stockton, California, and his mother Jo Anne Tardy recorded as a jazz singer, making his entire family deeply connected to both classical and jazz musical traditions.
