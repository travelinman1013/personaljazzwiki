## Biography
Paquito D'Rivera, born Francisco de Jesús Rivera Figueras on June 4, 1948, in Havana, Cuba, is a world-renowned alto saxophonist, clarinetist, and composer celebrated for his mastery of both Latin jazz and classical music. The son of classical saxophonist Tito Rivera, Paquito began music studies with his father at age five and quickly emerged as a prodigy, performing publicly by age seven. By ten, he was playing with the National Theater Orchestra of Cuba and studying at the Alejandro G. Caturla Conservatory. At 17, he became a featured soloist with the Cuban National Symphony Orchestra and co-founded the Orquesta Cubana de Música Moderna, which he also directed for two years.

In 1973, D'Rivera co-founded the groundbreaking band Irakere with pianist Chucho Valdés, fusing jazz, rock, classical, and traditional Cuban music in a style that garnered international acclaim and a Grammy Award in 1979. After defecting to the United States in 1981, D'Rivera established himself as a leading figure in both jazz and classical circles, performing as a soloist with major orchestras and founding ensembles such as the United Nation Orchestra (with Dizzy Gillespie), the Chamber Jazz Ensemble, the Paquito D’Rivera Big Band, and the Paquito D’Rivera Quintet. Over his prolific career, he has released more than 40 solo albums and received numerous accolades, including 16 combined Grammy and Latin Grammy Awards and the National Medal of Arts in 2005.

D'Rivera is known for his smooth saxophone tone and for seamlessly blending Latin jazz with classical traditions, championing Latin repertoire and premiering works by both Cuban and international composers. His legacy is marked by his role as a cultural ambassador, his innovative approach to genre fusion, and his influence on generations of musicians worldwide.
