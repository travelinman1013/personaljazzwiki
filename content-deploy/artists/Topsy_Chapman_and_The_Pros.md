## Biography
Topsy Chapman (1947–2022) was a renowned jazz and gospel musician from Kentwood, Louisiana, whose prodigious talent was evident from the age of three when she began singing and playing piano[1][5][7]. By six or seven, she was already earning money performing in churches, deeply rooted in the gospel tradition fostered by her father, a preacher and vocal music teacher[5][7]. At seventeen, Chapman moved to New Orleans, where she led her family's gospel group, The Chapmans, and quickly became a fixture in the city's vibrant music scene[1][4].

Her career gained international recognition when playwright Vernel Bagneris recruited her for his musical 'One Mo' Time,' a production set in 1920s New Orleans that achieved cult status both locally and Off-Broadway[1][4]. Chapman continued to perform with her daughters, Yolanda Robinson and Jolynda Phillips, under the group name Topsy Chapman and Solid Harmony, blending gospel fervor with traditional and modern jazz influences[1][2]. She was a regular performer at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival and was celebrated for her powerful voice and charismatic stage presence, leaving a lasting legacy in the New Orleans music community[1][2][4].
