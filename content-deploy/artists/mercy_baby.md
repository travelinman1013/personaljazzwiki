## Biography
Julius W. 'Jimmy' Mullins, known professionally as Mercy Baby, was born on March 12, 1930, near Rawls Springs in Forrest County, Mississippi, to parents Jessie and Jeff Mullins, the latter a nightwatchman. By around 1948, he had relocated to Dallas, Texas, where he established himself in the local music scene as a drummer, singer, and songwriter specializing in blues and rhythm and blues.[1]

Mullins began his recording career in 1957 as a drummer on Frankie Lee Sims' 'What Will Lucy Do?' for Ace Records, and he continued performing and recording with Sims' band through at least 1960. Under the name Mercy Baby, he released his debut singles that year: 'Marked Deck'/'Rock n' Roll Baby' and 'Silly Dilly Woman'/'Mercy's Blues' on Ace, both featuring Sims on guitar, followed by 'Pleadin''/'Don't Lie To Me' on Ric in 1958. He performed with Sims at Al Benson's rock and roll show in Chicago in November 1957 alongside acts like Big Maybelle and Screamin' Jay Hawkins. His later independent releases included 'Love's Voodoo'/'You Ran Away' (1958) and 'The Rock and Stomp'/'So Lonesome' (1959) on his own Mercy Baby label, plus a 1965 single 'I Tried It'/'I Messed Up' on P&P.[1]

Married and working in property maintenance toward the end of his life, Mullins died in Dallas on September 10, 1977, at age 47 from a gunshot wound to the neck sustained in an altercation. He was buried in Carver Memorial Park. His contributions to early blues and R&B remain documented primarily through his limited discography and association with Texas blues figures.[1]
