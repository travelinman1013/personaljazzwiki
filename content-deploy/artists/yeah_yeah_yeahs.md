- **Origin**: New York

## Biography
Yeah Yeah Yeahs are a seminal indie rock band formed in New York City in 2000, consisting of vocalist Karen O (Karen Lee Orzolek), guitarist/keyboardist Nick Zinner, and drummer Brian Chase. The band's origins trace back to Oberlin College in Ohio, where Karen O and Brian Chase first met as students in the late 1990s. After Karen O transferred to New York University, she met Nick Zinner, and together they initially explored acoustic music before shifting toward a more aggressive, punk-influenced sound inspired by the avant-garde and art-punk bands of their college years. Their name, inspired by New York City slang, reflects the band's playful and energetic ethos.[1][2][3]

The Yeah Yeah Yeahs quickly gained notoriety in the New York music scene with their electrifying live performances and distinctive style, drawing early comparisons to acts like Siouxsie and the Banshees and Blondie. Their debut album, 'Fever to Tell' (2003), propelled them to international acclaim, featuring the hit single 'Maps.' Subsequent albums, including 'Show Your Bones' (2006), 'It’s Blitz!' (2009), 'Mosquito' (2013), and 'Cool It Down' (2022), showcased their evolution from raw garage rock to a more synth-driven, art-punk sound. The band’s work has earned multiple Grammy nominations and solidified their legacy as pioneers of 21st-century indie rock.[1][2][3][4]

Known for Karen O’s charismatic and theatrical stage presence, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs have left a lasting impact on indie and alternative music, influencing a new generation of artists with their blend of punk energy, artful experimentation, and emotional intensity. Their music continues to resonate with audiences worldwide, and their contributions to the New York City rock revival of the early 2000s remain a defining chapter in modern music history.[3][4][5]
