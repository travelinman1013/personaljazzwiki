## Biography
Smoking Time Jazz Club is a New Orleans-based traditional jazz band that has been a cornerstone of the city's vibrant jazz renaissance since their formation in 2011. The band originated in New Orleans and quickly established themselves as one of the most productive and dedicated traditional jazz ensembles in the world, releasing over 90 recorded tracks across nine albums in their first nine years. Led by vocalist Sarah Peterson, who came to New Orleans in 2003, the band has maintained an unusually stable lineup in a city where most musicians are freelancers, allowing them to develop a tight, cohesive sound through long-running weekly residencies at venues like The Spotted Cat Music Club and Maison Frenchman.

The band specializes in reviving and refreshing the music of the 1920s and 30s, drawing heavily on early New Orleans jazz and blues traditions. Their approach combines deep respect for historical figures like Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Jelly Roll Morton, Bessie Smith, and Billie Holiday with a commitment to bringing these musical ideas into the contemporary landscape. Their repertoire includes reimagined classics such as Armstrong's "Perdido Street Blues" and "You Made Me Love You When I Saw You Cry," as well as obscure gems from the era like Alberta Jones' "My Slow and Easy Man" and Clarence Williams compositions. The band's mission statement reflects their philosophy: they play the greats because their contributions and insights remain relevant, aiming to carry these musical ideas forward with reverence and gratitude.

Smoking Time Jazz Club has become a fixture in New Orleans' traditional jazz scene, part of a remarkable musical renaissance that includes fellow groups like Tuba Skinny, Little Big Horns, and Shotgun Jazz Band. Their albums, including "Everything Is Righteous" (2015), "Take Your Time And Fly," and "Contrapuntal Stomp," showcase their evolution from energetic crowd-pleasers to more nuanced, bluesy interpretations. The band was nominated by Offbeat Magazine's "Best Of The Beat" Awards for Best Traditional Jazz Band and Best Traditional Jazz Album in 2022. They continue to perform weekly at their residencies, offering both casual visitors and jazz connoisseurs an authentic taste of New Orleans traditional jazz while serving as torchbearers for the city's rich musical heritage.
