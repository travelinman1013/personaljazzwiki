## Biography
Elmore James, born Elmore Brooks on January 27, 1918, in Richland, Mississippi, emerged from humble beginnings in a sharecropping family. He began making music as a child, first with a homemade diddley bow and later with guitar, performing at local dances in the Mississippi Delta. In his late teens, James toured with legendary bluesman Robert Johnson, whose slide guitar technique and boogie bass runs profoundly shaped James’s own style. After serving in the U.S. Navy during World War II, James returned to Mississippi and began recording, first as a sideman and then as a leader, scoring his breakthrough with the 1951 recording of "Dust My Broom," which became a major R&B hit and established his signature sound[1][3][4][5].

James’s career flourished in the 1950s and early 1960s, particularly in Chicago, where he became a central figure in the urban blues scene. His band, the Broomdusters, featured musicians like "Little" Johnny Jones and Odie Payne, and together they excited audiences with a fiery, amplified electric guitar sound that was both raw and innovative. James’s singing was marked by urgent intensity, and his slide guitar work—characterized by heavy amplifier reverberation—earned him the title "King of the Slide Guitar." He recorded several versions of "Dust My Broom" and memorable originals such as "The Sky Is Crying" and "Hand in Hand." Though he never achieved widespread fame during his lifetime, his influence grew posthumously, especially as rock musicians adopted his hard-driving style[1][3][4][5].

James’s legacy is vast: he helped define the Chicago blues sound and inspired generations of blues and rock guitarists. His music bridged rural Delta traditions and modern electric blues, influencing artists like B.B. King, Hound Dog Taylor, Stevie Ray Vaughan, and rock bands such as the Rolling Stones and Fleetwood Mac. He was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1980 and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992, cementing his status as a foundational figure in American music[1][2][3][4][7].
