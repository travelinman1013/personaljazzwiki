## Biography
Mr. Airplane Man is a garage rock and modern blues duo from Boston, Massachusetts, formed by Margaret Garrett (guitar, vocals) and Tara McManus (drums, keyboards) in 1998 after playing together since 1996. The band’s name pays homage to a Howlin' Wolf song, reflecting their deep roots in blues and rock traditions. Their early years were spent busking on Boston streets and playing frequent pub gigs, which helped them hone their raw, energetic sound and build a dedicated local following. In 1999, they were voted Best New Local Act by readers of the Boston Phoenix, signaling their arrival on the Boston music scene.[1][2]

Their debut album, recorded in 2001, showcased their stripped-down, primal style, drawing on influences from Mississippi blues and garage rock. The duo’s second album, 'Moanin’,' saw them collaborate with producer Jim Diamond and Greg Cartwright, further cementing their reputation for gritty, soulful music. Mr. Airplane Man toured extensively in the US and Europe, sharing stages with acts like The White Stripes, The Strokes, and local legends Lyres. Their music has been featured in pop culture, notably with their song 'Commit a Crime' appearing in Showtime's 'The L Word.' Over the years, they have remained a beloved fixture in both the blues and garage-rock circuits, known for their passionate performances and authentic sound.[1][2][3]

Mr. Airplane Man’s legacy lies in their ability to blend the raw power of garage rock with the emotional depth of blues, creating a sound that is both timeless and uniquely their own. Their influence can be traced in the resurgence of two-piece blues-rock bands in the early 2000s, and their dedication to their craft continues to inspire musicians in the Boston scene and beyond.[3]
