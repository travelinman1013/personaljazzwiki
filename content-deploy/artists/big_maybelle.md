## Biography
Mabel Louise Smith, professionally known as Big Maybelle, was born on May 1, 1924, in Jackson, Tennessee, and became one of the most powerful and expressive R&B vocalists of the 1950s. She began her musical journey singing gospel in her local Sanctified Church choir as a child, winning first prize at Memphis' Cotton Carnival singing competition at just eight years old. By her teens, she had transitioned to rhythm and blues, launching her professional career in 1936 with Dave Clark's Memphis Band. Throughout the late 1930s and 1940s, she toured with the all-female International Sweethearts of Rhythm and recorded with Christine Chatman's Orchestra, making her first recordings in 1944 on the Decca label.

Big Maybelle's breakthrough came in 1952 when she was discovered by producer Fred Mendelsohn at a performance with Jimmy Witherspoon at Detroit's Flame Show Bar. Mendelsohn signed her to Okeh Records and gave her the stage name "Big Maybelle" in recognition of her distinctive loud yet well-toned voice. Her debut recording for Okeh, "Gabbin' Blues," became an instant hit, reaching number three on the Billboard R&B chart in 1953, followed by successful releases "Way Back Home" and "My Country Man" that same year. Her deep, gravelly voice and commanding stage presence made her a sensation on the R&B circuit, performing at prestigious venues including the Apollo Theater in New York and the 1958 Newport Jazz Festival. She recorded for multiple labels including Savoy Records, where she achieved further success with songs like "Candy" (1956), which was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1999, and "96 Tears."

Despite her immense talent and early success, Big Maybelle's career was significantly impacted by heroin addiction and health issues that left her struggling financially and causing frequent no-shows at engagements. Her reputation suffered considerably, though contemporaries recognized her extraordinary abilities—Billie Holiday famously refused to follow her opening act, acknowledging the power of her performances. Big Maybelle died on January 23, 1972, in a Cleveland hospital from complications of diabetes, leaving behind a legacy as one of the premier R&B chanteuses of her era whose talent deserved greater stardom.
