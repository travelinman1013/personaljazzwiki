## Biography
Jolie Holland is an American singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist born in Houston, Texas. She emerged as a distinctive voice in the late 1990s, blending elements of folk, jazz, blues, country, and rock into a style that defies easy categorization. Holland was the founding member of The Be Good Tanyas, envisioning and naming the band, and contributing as a songwriter before departing prior to the release of their debut album, 'Blue Horse,' in 2001. Her early departure led her to pursue a solo career, beginning with the independently released album 'Catalpa' in 2003, which was later picked up by Anti Records and nominated for the Short List Music Prize by Tom Waits.

Holland’s solo work has been marked by a collage-like, poetic approach to songwriting, often drawing from a wide palette of American musical traditions. Albums such as 'Escondida,' 'Springtime Can Kill You,' and 'Wine Dark Sea' showcase her ability to channel the emotional depth and rawness of classic American song, while also experimenting with rhythm and genre. Her collaborations have included work with artists like Sage Francis, Booker T, Bad Religion, David Gray, and Buck Meek of Big Thief, the latter of whom co-wrote several tracks on her 2023 album 'Haunted Mountain.'

Throughout her career, Holland has been celebrated for her fearless emotional honesty and her refusal to be confined by genre boundaries. Her influence is felt among a new generation of songwriters, and her legacy is that of an artist who has continually pushed the boundaries of American roots music while honoring its traditions.
