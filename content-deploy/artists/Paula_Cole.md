## Biography
Paula Cole, born April 5, 1968, in Rockport, Massachusetts, is an acclaimed American singer-songwriter known for her emotionally resonant lyrics and genre-defying sound. Raised in a musical family, Cole attended Berklee College of Music as a jazz singer, graduating in 1990, and initially turned down a jazz record deal to pursue her own songwriting vision. Her early career breakthrough came when Peter Gabriel invited her to join his 1993–94 Secret World Tour, where she replaced Sinéad O'Connor and performed to international audiences, gaining valuable exposure and acclaim.

Cole released her debut album, 'Harbinger,' in 1994, but it was her second album, 'This Fire' (1996), that catapulted her to stardom. The album produced the Grammy-nominated hit 'Where Have All the Cowboys Gone?' and 'I Don't Want to Wait,' the latter becoming the theme song for the TV series 'Dawson's Creek.' Cole made history as the first woman to be solely nominated for the Grammy Award for Producer of the Year for her work on 'This Fire.' She won the Grammy for Best New Artist in 1998 and was a prominent performer at the Lilith Fair festival. Over her career, Cole has explored a range of styles, from folk-rock to jazz, and her music often addresses themes of social justice, gender, and personal introspection. She continues to record, perform, and teach, serving on the faculty at Berklee College of Music since 2013.
