## Biography
Shirley Ellis (January 19, 1929 – October 5, 2005) was an American soul singer and songwriter of West Indian heritage who became an innovative force in 1960s popular music.[1][2] Born Shirley Marie O'Garra in the Bronx to parents from Montserrat and the Bahamas, she initially pursued songwriting, registering her first copyrights with the Library of Congress in 1954 and writing songs for doo-wop groups including The Chords and The Sh-Booms.[2] Her breakthrough came after winning the Amateur Night competition at the Harlem Apollo Theatre in 1954, following in the footsteps of Billie Holiday and Ella Fitzgerald.[2] In 1959, she met songwriter and producer Lincoln Chase, who became her creative partner and manager, fundamentally shaping her recording career.

Ellis achieved commercial success between 1963 and 1965 with a series of novelty-soul hits that transcended their playful premises through sophisticated production and her powerful vocal delivery.[2][3] Her debut hit "The Nitty Gritty" (1963) reached number eight on the US Billboard 100, followed by "The Name Game" (1964), which climbed to number three, and "The Clapping Song" (1965), which reached number eight in the US and number six in the UK, earning her first gold disc.[2][3] These songs, based on children's playground rhymes and arranged by producer Charles Calello, emphasized syncopation and featured exceptional session musicianship.[3] Though sometimes dismissed as novelty records, Ellis demonstrated substantial artistry across three studio albums: *In Action* (1964), *The Name Game* (1965), and *Sugar, Let's Shing-a-Ling* (1967).[1]

Ellis retired from the music industry in 1968 after a brief but impactful recording career, leaving behind a legacy as a Northern Soul stalwart whose influence extended far beyond her commercial hits.[2][3] Her work became particularly celebrated in UK Northern Soul circles during the late 1960s and 1970s, with tracks like "Soul Time" (1967) becoming dance floor classics.[1] Though her active recording span was short, Ellis demonstrated remarkable versatility, moving from playful rhythm-and-blues innovations to progressive soul and funk influences emerging from Detroit, Chicago, and New York City.[1]
