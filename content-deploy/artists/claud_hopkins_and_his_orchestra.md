## Biography
Claude Hopkins was born on August 24, 1903, in Alexandria, Virginia, and became a prominent figure in early jazz and swing music as a stride pianist, bandleader, arranger, and composer. He was the son of faculty members at Howard University, and his early musical education was rooted in classical training before he gravitated toward jazz. At the age of 21, Hopkins left home to join the Wilbur Sweatman Orchestra, marking the beginning of his professional career. In 1925, he sailed to Europe as musical director for Josephine Baker's Revue Nègre, which featured Sidney Bechet and helped establish his reputation internationally. Returning to the United States, Hopkins led bands at major venues such as the Savoy Ballroom, Roseland Ballroom, and the Cotton Club, becoming a fixture in the Harlem jazz scene during the 1930s. His style blended the elegance of stride piano with the energy of swing, and he was known for his sophisticated arrangements and leadership of ensembles featuring top-tier jazz musicians.

Throughout his career, Hopkins adapted to the changing landscape of jazz, leading both big bands and small groups. He disbanded his orchestra in 1940 but continued to work as an arranger and sideman, collaborating with artists like Henry 'Red' Allen and Wild Bill Davison. In the 1950s and 1960s, he remained active in New York, performing at clubs and festivals, and recording with various Dixieland and swing ensembles. Hopkins was admired for his gentle yet powerful piano playing and his ability to nurture talent within his bands. Despite being overshadowed by the rise of the swing era, his contributions to early jazz and swing music remain significant, and his recordings continue to be celebrated for their artistry and historical value.
