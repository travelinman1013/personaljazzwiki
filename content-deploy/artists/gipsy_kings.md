- **Origin**: Arles

## Biography
The Gipsy Kings originated from two gypsy families, the Reyes and Baliardo brothers, who fled Catalonia during the Spanish Civil War and settled in Arles and Montpellier, France. Young brothers Nicolas, Canut, and Paul Reyes began their musical journey accompanying their father, renowned flamenco singer Jose Reyes, who had previously formed a celebrated duo with Manitas de Plata, admired by figures like Miles Davis and Pablo Picasso. After Jose's death in 1979, the Reyes sons joined forces with the guitar-playing Baliardo brothers—Tonino, Paco, and Diego—initially performing as Los Reyes, busking on streets, at weddings, and parties while blending traditional flamenco with Latin rumba rhythms and pop elements to create their signature 'rumba gitano' style.[1][2][3][6]

In 1987, they adopted the name Gipsy Kings—suggested by an American admirer who translated 'Los Reyes' as 'Gipsy Kings'—and released their self-titled debut album, which became a global phenomenon, certified gold and platinum worldwide. Hits like 'Bamboleo,' 'Djobi Djoba,' and 'Un Amor' propelled them to fame, with the album charting for 40 weeks in the US, a rarity for Spanish-language records. Their second album, Mosaique, featured a rumba version of 'Volare,' further boosting popularity across Europe, the Middle East, and beyond. Despite criticism from flamenco purists for incorporating drums, electronic bass, and rock/reggae beats, they sold nearly 20 million albums, earned a Latin Grammy for Love and Liberté (1993), and featured in soundtracks like The Big Lebowski and Toy Story 3.[1][2][5][7]

Fronted by songwriters Nicolas Reyes and Tonino Baliardo, the group has maintained a consistent lineup of family members, touring non-stop for decades and evolving their sound while honoring gypsy traditions. Tonino released solo albums like Essences (2001), but the band's enduring appeal lies in their energetic fusion of flamenco guitar, rhythmic strumming, and percussive flair, influencing world music and retaining a core following.[1][2][7]

## Fun Facts
- The name 'Gipsy Kings' was coined accidentally by an American woman who exclaimed 'Oh, you are Gipsy Kings!' after learning they were from Los Reyes.[1][3]
- They shifted from traditional 'cante jondo' flamenco to rumba flamenca because 'we liked to watch pretty girls dance,' as Nicolas Reyes explained.[1]
- Their cover of 'Hotel California' was featured in the Coen Brothers' film The Big Lebowski.[1]
- Nicolas Reyes and Tonino Baliardo are cousins, tying the Reyes and Baliardo families closely.[7]
