## Biography
Kurt Vile, born Kurt Samuel Vile on January 3, 1980, in Lansdowne, Delaware County, Pennsylvania, grew up in a large artistic family as the third of ten children, with his mother a poet and painter and his father an art professor.[2][4][7] He began playing guitar around 2000 after a brief stint in soccer, creating lo-fi home recordings in his bedroom and launching his career in Philadelphia's indie rock scene.[1][2][3] In 2003, he collaborated with Adam Granduciel to form The War on Drugs, contributing as lead guitarist until departing after their 2008 debut album Wagonwheel Blues to focus on solo work.[1][2] Vile released early albums like Constant Hitmaker (2008) and Childish Prodigy (2009) on indie labels, signing with Matador Records and achieving critical acclaim with Smoke Ring for My Halo (2011), Wakin on a Pretty Daze (2013), and b'lieve i'm goin down... (2015).[2][3]

Vile's music blends indie rock, folk, psychedelic elements, folk-rock, and Americana, often likened to Neil Young, Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, Tom Waits, Pavement, and Tom Petty, characterized by slacker rock, masterful guitar work, and introspective, unpretentious lyrics.[1][2][3][4] He performs solo and with his backing band The Violators, has sold over 1 million albums globally with 500 million Spotify streams, and earned Grammy nominations plus a win for Best Alternative Music Album tied to War on Drugs' Lost in the Dream (though primarily credited to his contributions).[1][3] Recent releases include (watch my moves) (2022) on Verve Records and the 2023 EP Back to Moon Beach, solidifying his legacy as one of the decade's top songwriters and guitarists, named among Rolling Stone's 250 Best Guitarists.[3]

Based in Philadelphia with his wife and two homeschooled daughters, Vile maintains a home studio for creative routines, balancing confidence with sensitivity amid career highs like late-night TV appearances and cultural nods such as a Jeopardy! answer.[3][4][5]
