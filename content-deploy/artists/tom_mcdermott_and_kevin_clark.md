## Biography
Tom McDermott, born in St. Louis, Missouri in 1957, is a pianist and composer renowned for his mastery of New Orleans jazz, ragtime, and Brazilian choro. He began piano lessons at age six, influenced by classical music and the vibrant ragtime scene in St. Louis, which was a hub for the genre before the Scott Joplin revival. McDermott's early exposure to ragtime, amplified by the release of Joshua Rifkin's Joplin albums, led him to compose and perform original rags. He earned a Master of Music degree from Washington University in St. Louis in 1982 and moved to New Orleans in 1984, where he immersed himself in the city's musical traditions, working with bands like the Dukes of Dixieland and co-founding the New Orleans Nightcrawlers. McDermott's career is marked by a commitment to both tradition and innovation, blending New Orleans styles with Brazilian choro and other eclectic influences.

Kevin Clark is a jazz guitarist originally from Long Island, New York, who began studying guitar at age 13. He has become a frequent collaborator with Tom McDermott, contributing to several recordings and performances that highlight their shared interest in New Orleans jazz and classic standards. Together, McDermott and Clark have released albums such as 'Smiles' and 'Temptation Rag,' which showcase their chemistry and deep understanding of the genre. Their partnership has helped keep the spirit of traditional jazz alive while also exploring new arrangements and interpretations.
