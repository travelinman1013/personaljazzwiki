## Biography
Harry Henry Choates (December 26, 1922 – July 17, 1951) was a pioneering American Cajun fiddler widely celebrated as the 'Fiddle King of Cajun Swing' and the 'Godfather of Cajun Music.' Born in southern Louisiana—most likely Rayne, though sources also cite New Iberia, Abbeville, or Cow Island—Choates moved with his mother to Port Arthur, Texas, during the 1930s, joining a wave of Cajun migration seeking work in the oil fields. He received little formal education and spent his formative years absorbing music in local bars, quickly becoming a prodigious fiddler who played for tips in barbershops by age twelve.[1][2][3][5][8]

Choates began performing professionally in his teens, joining bands led by Cajun luminaries like Leo Soileau and Leroy 'Happy Fats' LeBlanc. By the mid-1940s, he formed his own group, the Melody Boys, and in 1946 recorded a dynamic, Western swing-infused version of the Cajun waltz 'Jole Blon' for Gold Star Records. The single became a national sensation, reaching No. 4 on the Billboard charts and introducing Cajun music to a broad American audience. Choates' style was marked by energetic showmanship, blending traditional Cajun melodies with Western swing, jazz, and blues, and he became known for his exuberant vocal cries and electrifying fiddle performances.[1][2][4][5][6]

Despite his musical genius, Choates led a tumultuous life, marked by heavy drinking and erratic behavior. He was virtually illiterate, often performed while intoxicated, and clashed with musicians' unions, leading to professional setbacks. Choates died tragically at age 28 in an Austin jail cell, but his influence endured: he elevated Cajun music to national prominence and inspired generations of musicians across genres.[1][2][4][6][8]

## Fun Facts
- Choates never owned his own musical instrument, preferring to play on borrowed fiddles and guitars throughout his career.[2][3][5]
- His signature song 'Jole Blon' is often called the 'Cajun national anthem' and was the first Cajun song to become a national hit in the United States.[1][4][5]
- Choates was known for his wild stage antics, including playing his amplified fiddle while dancing with the audience and standing on tiptoe to reach high notes.[2][5]
- He was virtually illiterate and often disregarded contracts, leading to frequent disputes with musicians' unions and the eventual breakup of his band.[2]
