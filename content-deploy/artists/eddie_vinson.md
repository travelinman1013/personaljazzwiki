## Biography
Eddie 'Cleanhead' Vinson was born Edward L. Vinson Jr. on December 18, 1917, in Houston, Texas. Raised in a musical family—his father was a pianist and his grandfather a fiddle player—Vinson began playing the alto saxophone as a child. By his teenage years, he was already performing with local bands, notably Chester Boone's territory band, and later joined Milton Larkins' ensemble, where he met influential jazz and blues figures such as T-Bone Walker, Arnett Cobb, and Illinois Jacquet. Vinson's early exposure to the blues was shaped by Big Bill Broonzy, who taught him the art of shouting the blues, and his style evolved to blend jazz, blues, and rhythm & blues with a distinctive 'wheezy Texas' vocal delivery.

Vinson's career spanned several decades and genres. In the 1940s, he joined Cootie Williams's orchestra, made his recording debut, and later formed his own big band and sextet, which included a young John Coltrane. He was known for his jump-blues hits like 'Juice Head Baby' and 'Kidney Stew Blues,' as well as his bebop-influenced saxophone playing. Though his raunchy lyrics sometimes limited radio airplay, his work was critically acclaimed. Vinson experienced a resurgence in the 1960s thanks to Cannonball Adderley, and continued recording into the 1980s, leaving a legacy as a versatile and influential figure in both jazz and blues.
