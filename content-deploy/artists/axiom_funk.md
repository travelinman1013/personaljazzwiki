## Biography
Axiom Funk is not a traditional band or solo artist, but rather a collaborative project spearheaded by renowned bassist and producer Bill Laswell in the mid-1990s. Conceived as a studio 'supergroup,' Axiom Funk brought together an eclectic roster of musicians primarily associated with the Parliament-Funkadelic collective, as well as other luminaries from the worlds of funk, rock, and experimental music. The project’s only full-length album, 'Funkcronomicon' (1995), stands as a testament to Laswell’s vision of fusing deep funk grooves with avant-garde production and genre-blurring collaborations.

The roots of Axiom Funk lie in Laswell’s long-standing fascination with funk, jazz, and world music, as well as his history of working with members of the P-Funk family. By the early 1990s, Laswell had already established himself as a prolific producer and the founder of Axiom Records, a label dedicated to boundary-pushing releases. For 'Funkcronomicon,' Laswell assembled a lineup that included George Clinton, Bootsy Collins, Bernie Worrell, Eddie Hazel, Maceo Parker, and Sly Dunbar, among others. The album features both new material and reworked tracks, some of which were among the final recordings of legendary guitarist Eddie Hazel.

Musically, Axiom Funk is characterized by its dense, psychedelic funk sound, layered with experimental production techniques and contributions from a diverse array of musicians. The project is notable for its reverence for the P-Funk tradition while simultaneously pushing the genre into new sonic territories. Though Axiom Funk released only one album, 'Funkcronomicon' has achieved cult status and is regarded as a significant entry in the evolution of modern funk, bridging the classic era of Parliament-Funkadelic with contemporary experimental music.

## Fun Facts
- The 'Funkcronomicon' album title is a play on H.P. Lovecraft’s fictional grimoire, the Necronomicon, reflecting the album’s mystical and experimental vibe.
- Several tracks on 'Funkcronomicon' feature some of the last studio recordings made by Eddie Hazel before his death in 1992.
- Axiom Funk was not a touring band; it existed solely as a studio project curated by Bill Laswell.
- The project brought together musicians from funk, jazz, reggae, and experimental backgrounds, many of whom had never previously recorded together.
