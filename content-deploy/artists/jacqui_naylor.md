## Biography
Jacqui Naylor is a celebrated American jazz vocalist and songwriter, born and raised in Saratoga, California. Her early exposure to music came from her parents' collection of antique automated instruments and vintage records, which sparked her interest in jazz standards. Although she participated in musicals and talent shows during high school, Naylor initially pursued a marketing degree at San Francisco State University. Her passion for music was reignited after hearing Sarah Vaughan's interpretation of Gershwin in a college class, leading her to study voice with renowned San Francisco jazz coach Faith Winthrop from 1991 to 1995. She further honed her skills in New York with Shirley Calloway before returning to San Francisco in 1997 to focus on her singing career full-time.[1][2][6]

Naylor quickly gained recognition for her distinctive vocal style, which blends the inflections of Billie Holiday and June Christy with gospel influences and contemporary sensibilities. Her repertoire spans jazz standards, original compositions, and inventive arrangements that often merge jazz and rock elements—a technique she calls 'acoustic smashing.' This approach involves singing a jazz standard over the groove of a rock tune, or vice versa, creating fresh interpretations that appeal to diverse audiences.[2][3][4] Naylor has released over a dozen albums, performed internationally at venues such as Yoshi's and the Blue Note, and her music has been featured in films, television, and advertising. She is widely regarded for her versatility, subtlety, and ability to bridge genres, earning acclaim from both jazz aficionados and new listeners alike.[3][7]
