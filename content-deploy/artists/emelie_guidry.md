## Biography
Emelie Guidry is a singer, songwriter, pianist, and guitarist born in 1984 in Lafayette, Louisiana, a culturally rich hub in the heart of Cajun and Creole country.[1][2] Early exposure to the diverse musical traditions of south Louisiana—ranging from roots and folk styles to New Orleans‑influenced rhythm and blues—helped shape her as a versatile performer and writer. She developed a reputation for strong melodic sense and a warm, engaging vocal style, accompanying herself on both piano and guitar in intimate club and bar settings.[1][2]

In 2012 Guidry made a decisive career move to New Orleans, where she began performing regularly at the famed Pat O’Brien’s piano bar in the French Quarter, working there four to five nights a week and honing her craft in front of both locals and tourists.[3] Groovescapes New Orleans described her as “a talented and versatile singer/songwriter and musician,” underscoring her ability to shift comfortably among styles in a live setting.[1][2] Alongside her busy performance schedule, she released a self‑titled EP, featuring original material such as the track “What Love Is,” which showcases her melodic pop sensibility blended with singer‑songwriter intimacy.[1][3] Continuing to appear in New Orleans venues and on local radio playlists, she has become part of the contemporary piano‑bar and club scene that keeps the city’s live‑music tradition vibrant.[3][5]
