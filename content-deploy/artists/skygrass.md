## Biography
Simon 'Skygrass' Bowden is a Kingston, Jamaica-born singer, songwriter, producer, multi-instrumentalist, and visual artist who has emerged as one of the fastest-rising reggae artists in the contemporary music scene. Before establishing himself as a solo artist, Bowden was the lead singer and rhythm guitarist of the Skygrass band, which was formed in 2009 with members Rasheed McCallum (guitarist) and Suane Brown (drummer). His musical journey reflects a unique blend of reggae, rock, and classical influences, characterized by witty, layered lyrics, catchy melodies, and energetic guitar work that positions him in a genre-bending category. Bowden's style has been compared to reggae legends like Damian Marley and rock icons like Lenny Kravitz, establishing him as a bridge between generations in reggae music.

Beyond his musical pursuits, Bowden is an accomplished creative director and brand consultant who became the most sought-after in the Caribbean, working on major campaigns for brands including Coca-Cola, Appleton Estate Rum, Nissan, Red Stripe, and the Olympics. His multifaceted career demonstrates his commitment to artistic excellence across disciplines. As a solo artist, Skygrass released his album 'Walking On Water' in October 2025, which showcases his impressive range as a multi-instrumentalist, with him playing guitar, drums, percussion, sitar, bass, keys, and more. The album represents two years of meticulous development and establishes Skygrass as a visionary artist unafraid to stretch reggae's boundaries while maintaining deep reverence for the genre's rich history and his Rastafarian faith.

Skygrass's approach to music-making emphasizes authenticity and integrity, with what he describes as a 'new school with an old soul' philosophy. His work as a visual artist, with commissions for public buildings, further demonstrates his creative vision. In his personal life, Bowden became engaged in early 2024 to recording artist and comedian Nicole Arbour after they met while working together on her single 'This Is It' in Kingston in 2023. He also appeared in the Bob Marley biopic 'Bob Marley: One Love,' playing the character 'Cat Coore' from Third World.
