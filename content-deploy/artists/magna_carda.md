## Biography
Magna Carda is an Austin-based hip hop group known for their genre-blending sound that fuses rap, jazz, R&B, and electronic music, often performed with a live band. The group was founded in 2012 by Megz Kelli, a queer Black female rapper originally from New Orleans, and Dougie Do, a producer and keyboardist, while both were students at St. Edward’s University in Austin, Texas[2][3]. Kelli’s early life in New Orleans immersed her in a rich musical environment, and she began writing lyrics as early as age seven; after her family was displaced by Hurricane Katrina, she moved to Dallas and later Austin, where she and Dougie Do began crafting music that would become Magna Carda’s signature style[2]. The duo quickly expanded into a full band, incorporating live instrumentation and earning a reputation as 'Austin’s answer to The Roots' for their dynamic performances and genre-defying approach[3]. Over the past decade, Magna Carda has become a staple of Austin’s music scene, sharing stages with notable acts like The Pharcyde, Joey Bada$$, Chali 2na, and Oddisee, and winning the Austin Music Award for Best Rap/Hip-Hop Artist five years in a row[2][3]. Their music is celebrated for its lyrical depth, jazz-inflected melodies, and the organic interplay between Kelli’s sharp, socially conscious rhymes and the band’s lush, live arrangements[3][5].
