## Biography
George Colar, better known as Kid Sheik or Kid Sheik Cola, was born on September 15, 1908, in New Orleans, Louisiana. Growing up in the vibrant musical environment of New Orleans, he began teaching himself piano at age twelve before moving on to drums and eventually the cornet. His early trumpet instruction came from 'Wooden' Joe Nicholas, and he was deeply influenced by local jazz legends such as Chris Kelly, with whom he began performing professionally as a teenager. By the mid-1920s, Kid Sheik was playing in local bands and soon formed his own group, performing at dances and parties throughout the city and its famed Storyville district.

The 1930s were a challenging period for jazz musicians in New Orleans, but Kid Sheik persevered, supplementing his income with other work while continuing to play music whenever possible. In 1943, he enlisted in the US Army Air Corps, where he attended the Air Corps music school and led a small group until 1945. After returning to civilian life, he joined the Eureka Brass Band and the Olympia Brass Band, becoming a fixture in the New Orleans jazz scene for decades. The 1960s marked a turning point as Kid Sheik began recording and touring internationally, performing with groups such as the Preservation Hall Jazz Band and collaborating with musicians like Captain John Handy and Barry Martyn. His distinctive trumpet style, rooted in the traditional New Orleans sound, earned him international recognition and respect.

In his later years, Kid Sheik continued to perform and tour, notably with the Preservation Hall Jazz Band throughout the 1980s. He married pianist and singer Sadie Goodson in 1982, and the couple often performed together. Kid Sheik's legacy is celebrated as a vital link to the early days of New Orleans jazz, and he was honored as the subject of the official New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival poster in 1990. He passed away on November 7, 1996, leaving behind a rich legacy as one of the last great traditional jazz trumpeters of his era.
