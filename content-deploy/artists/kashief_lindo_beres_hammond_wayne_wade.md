## Biography
Kashief Lindo is a Jamaican reggae singer specializing in lovers rock, born in Jamaica in the late 1970s and migrating to the United States at age 6. He launched his career over 20 years ago with upbeat tracks like 'The First Cut' and 'No Can Do,' establishing himself through Heavy Beat Records, the label founded by his father, Willie Lindo, which became prominent in the 1980s for reggae hits. Lindo's style blends romantic ballads with occasional covers and social themes, as seen in albums like 'A Reggae Tribute to Michael Jackson' (2012), the EP 'Justice: A Conscious Journey' (featuring socially conscious songs), and his 2021 release 'Love On,' his first full album in nine years with 14 tracks mostly originals produced by his father.[3][6][1]

His career highlights include producing and playing on key releases for Heavy Beat Records, contributing to successes by artists like Beres Hammond and Wayne Wade. Lindo's work reflects a return to lovers rock roots, with recent projects like the 2024 Latin-flavored single and collaborations underscoring his enduring presence in reggae. He shares strong ties to South Florida's reggae scene via Heavy Beat, which charted hits such as Beres Hammond's 'What One Dance Can Do' and Wayne Wade's 'Love You Too Much' (also known as 'I Love You Too Much').[1][3][2]

Beres Hammond (born Hugh Beresford Hammond, August 28, 1955, Annotto Bay, Saint Mary, Jamaica) is a veteran reggae icon celebrated for romantic lovers rock. Wayne Wade (born c.1960, Kingston, Jamaica) debuted in the mid-1970s as a prodigy of producer Yabby You. Both have collaborated with Lindo, notably on the 'Sweet Reggae Music - EP' including tracks like 'No Can Do' and 'She Loves Me Now.'[7][5][2]
