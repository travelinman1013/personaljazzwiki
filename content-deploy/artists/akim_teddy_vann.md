## Biography
Teddy Vann was a prolific Brooklyn-born songwriter, producer, and musical polymath, raised in the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn, New York. Largely self-educated, he was hailed as a mathematical and musical genius who began his career as a performer, gaining attention with his ballad 'The Lonely Crowd' that earned him a spot on *American Bandstand*. He soon shifted to songwriting and production, penning the 1960s novelty hit 'Loop de Loop' for Johnny Thunder—which was also covered by Bobby Rydell and Frankie Vaughan—and producing most of the Bobbettes' singles from 1960 to 1965. Vann's multifaceted talents extended to creating the 1966 album *The Adventures of Coloredman*, a comedic superhero narrative narrated by James Earl Jones, where he handled writing, arranging, production, and even cover art.[1][2][3][5]

## Fun Facts
- Vann referred to himself as a 'born-again African' and was among the first in New York City to organize Kwanzaa celebrations in the mid-1960s.[2][3]
- He single-handedly created the 1966 album *The Adventures of Coloredman*, writing the story and songs, arranging, producing, and painting the cover art himself.[2]
- Vann sued filmmaker John Waters in 2006 to block 'Santa Claus Is a Black Man' from his novelty Christmas compilation, viewing it as disrespectful to the song's empowering message, though he lost the case.[2][3]
- A lifelong civil rights advocate, Vann mentored at-risk youth using basketball and chess to teach strategy, leadership, and teamwork, and authored a book on math and basketball still used in American schools.[3]
