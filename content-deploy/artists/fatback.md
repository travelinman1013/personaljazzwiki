## Biography
The Fatback Band, later known simply as Fatback, was formed in New York City in 1970 by veteran session drummer Bill Curtis. Curtis, who had played with a range of prominent R&B and jazz musicians, sought to create a new groove by merging the 'fatback' jazz beat of New Orleans with West Indian and Caribbean rhythms, resulting in a unique blend of funk, jazz funk, and post-disco sounds. The original lineup included Curtis, guitarist Johnny King, bassist Johnny Flippin, trumpet player George Williams, saxophonist Earl Shelton, flautist George Adams, and keyboardist Gerry Thomas. Their early work was marked by energetic performances in New York clubs and cabarets, quickly earning them recognition for their innovative 'street funk' style.[1][2][3][4]

Fatback signed with Perception Records and achieved their first chart success with the single 'Street Dance' in 1973. Over the next decade, the band released a prolific series of albums, including 'Let's Do It Again,' 'People Music,' and 'Feel My Soul,' before moving to Event Records and later Spring/Polydor. Their sound evolved to incorporate more dance-oriented elements, contributing to the disco era with hits like '(Let's Do The) Spanish Hustle,' 'Party Time,' and 'The Booty.' In 1977, the group shortened its name to Fatback and continued to innovate, notably releasing 'King Tim III (Personality Jock)' in 1979, which is widely credited as the first commercially released rap single, predating the Sugarhill Gang's 'Rapper's Delight.'[1][3][4]

Fatback's legacy is significant in the development of funk, disco, and early hip-hop. The band is recognized for its genre-blending approach and for pioneering the integration of rap into recorded music. Their influence extends to later generations of musicians, and their tracks have been widely sampled in hip-hop and dance music. Fatback remains active, with Bill Curtis at the helm, and has released over 35 albums, maintaining their reputation for energetic live performances and musical innovation.[3][4]
