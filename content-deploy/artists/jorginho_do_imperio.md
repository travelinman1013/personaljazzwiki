## Biography
Jorge Antônio Carlos, known as Jorginho do Império, was born on February 13, 1944, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to Mano Décio da Viola, a renowned composer and co-founder of the Império Serrano samba school. From childhood, he frequented the school, serving as one of its mascotes, immersing himself in samba culture. He began his career opening shows for Martinho da Vila and playing as a ritmista in his backing group. In 1971, he was elected 'Cidadão Samba do Estado da Guanabara,' marking early recognition.[1][2]

Jorginho launched his recording career in 1973 with the LP 'Pedra noventa,' followed by successful albums like 'Viagem encantada' (1975), featuring hits such as 'Na beira do mar' and 'Dinheiro vai, dinheiro vem.' His discography spans over 21 LPs and several CDs, including live recordings like 'Pra quem gosta de samba' (2002) and 'Jorginho do Império Ao vivo – O Filho do Imperador' (2012). He served as the official puxador (lead singer) for Império Serrano in 1996, 1997, and 1999, including the samba-enredo 'Uma rua chamada Brasil,' and also acted as diretor de carnaval. His style is rooted in samba and pagode, with international performances in countries like Japan, France, Argentina, and Hong Kong.[1][2]

Today, Jorginho resides in Madureira, Rio de Janeiro, near the Império Serrano on a street named after his father. He hosts the radio program 'Barracão do Samba' on Rádio Livre 1440 with Marcelo Pacífico and launched barracaodosamba.com in 2011 for samba content and web broadcasts. In 2005, he celebrated 30 years of career with the roda de samba 'Butiquim do Jorginho do Império.'[1][2]
