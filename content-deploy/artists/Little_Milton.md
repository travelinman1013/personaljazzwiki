## Biography
Little Milton, born James Milton Campbell Jr. on September 7, 1934, near Inverness, Mississippi, was a pivotal figure in American blues and soul music. Raised in the Mississippi Delta, he was the son of 'Big' Milton Campbell, a blues musician and farmer, and grew up surrounded by the sounds of rural blues and the Grand Ole Opry. Milton built his first guitar as a child and purchased his first real one at age twelve, funding it with money earned from cotton field labor. By his teens, he was performing locally and gaining experience under the guidance of established musicians.

Milton's professional career began in the early 1950s when Ike Turner introduced him to Sam Phillips of Sun Records, leading to his first recordings. He later moved to St. Louis, where he co-founded Bobbin Records and played a key role in recruiting talent, including Albert King. His breakthrough came after signing with Checker Records in Chicago, where he blended blues with soul, achieving national success with hits like 'We're Gonna Make It.' Over the decades, Milton recorded for several major labels, including Stax and Malaco, producing a string of influential albums and singles. Renowned for his powerful vocals, expressive guitar work, and business acumen, Little Milton remained a major attraction on the blues circuit until his death from a stroke on August 4, 2005. He was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1988, cementing his legacy as a bridge between traditional blues and soul music.
