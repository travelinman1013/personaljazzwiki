# Charles Brackeen

## Biography
Charles Brackeen was born on March 13, 1940, in Eufaula, Oklahoma, where he grew up on a cattle and hog farm. He initially studied violin and piano before switching to saxophone at age 10, spending time in Texas and California before settling in the latter in 1956. Primarily a tenor saxophonist who also played soprano, Brackeen emerged in the avant-garde and free jazz scenes, influenced by the post-Ornette Coleman network of musicians.[1][3][5][6][8]

Brackeen's career gained prominence in the 1960s and 1970s through key recordings like the 1968 album Rhythm X with Don Cherry, Charlie Haden, and Ed Blackwell, showcasing his roots in the Coleman school. He collaborated extensively with drummer Paul Motian in the late 1970s, appearing on albums such as Dance (1977) and Le Voyage (1979), featuring bassists David Izenzon and J.F. Jenny-Clark. His style blended Southwestern cry reminiscent of Dewey Redman with fervent improvisations echoing Albert Ayler, marked by multi-hued tenor cadenzas and confident trio interplay.[4][6]

Brackeen remained a mysterious, under-recorded figure in jazz, revered among fans of creatively improvised music for his idiosyncratic contributions. He passed away in Carson, California, leaving a sparse but impactful discography that highlights his natural musicianship and ties to ECM's innovative jazz output.[4][7][8]
