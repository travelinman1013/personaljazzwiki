## Biography
The Enchanters were a Philadelphia-based vocal group formed in 1961 by soul singer **Garnet Mimms**, who had recently disbanded his previous ensemble, the Gainors. Mimms teamed up with Charles Boyer to create the group, which specialized in soul and R&B harmonies during the 1960s. They gained recognition for their emotive vocal style, led by Mimms' powerful voice, and released recordings that captured the era's transition from doo-wop to deeper soul expressions.[3][4][7]

The group operated primarily in the mid-1960s, producing music under various labels and contributing to the Philadelphia soul scene. While specific album details are limited in available records, their work reflected Mimms' shift toward gospel-infused soul, building on his earlier experiences. The Enchanters disbanded after the decade, with Mimms pursuing a notable solo career highlighted by hits like 'Cry Baby.'[3][4]

Their legacy endures as a key part of 1960s soul history, influencing the vocal group sound in R&B, though they remain somewhat obscure compared to contemporaries. Note that 'The Enchanters' also refers to other groups, such as a 1950s doo-wop act from Queens and a Chicago quintet led by Billy Butler, but the primary association is with Mimms' Philadelphia outfit.[1][2][5][7]
