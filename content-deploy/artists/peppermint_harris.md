## Biography
Peppermint Harris, born Harrison Demotra Nelson, Jr. on July 17, 1925, in Texarkana, Texas, was a prominent American rhythm and blues and jump blues singer and guitarist. He began his musical journey in Houston in the late 1940s, performing professionally at venues such as the Eldorado Ballroom and recording under the name Peppermint Nelson. His stage name 'Peppermint' was inspired by the trend of catchy nicknames among local blues musicians, and his friend Lightnin' Hopkins played a pivotal role in helping him secure his first recording opportunity.

Harris's breakthrough came in 1951 after moving to Los Angeles, where he signed with Modern Records and recorded for Aladdin Records. His single "I Got Loaded" became a major hit, reaching number one on the U.S. Billboard R&B chart in November 1951. Despite releasing several more tracks, none matched the success of his signature song. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, Harris continued recording for various smaller labels in Southern California, and later in Shreveport, Sacramento, and New Jersey. His final album was released in 1995. Harris's blend of blues, rhythm and blues, and jump blues helped shape the genre's development, and he remained active in music until his passing in Elizabeth, New Jersey, on March 19, 1999, at age 73.
