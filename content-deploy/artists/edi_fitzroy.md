## Biography
Edi Fitzroy, born Fitzroy Edwards on November 17, 1955, in Chapelton, Clarendon Parish, Jamaica, was a prominent reggae singer-songwriter whose career began in the mid-1970s and flourished during the dancehall era. The son of sound system operator Vasco Edwards, Fitzroy was exposed to Jamaican popular music from an early age and developed a deep connection to the culture and struggles of his community. He attended Chapelton All-Age and Clarendon College before moving to Kingston, where he studied accounts at the West Indies Commercial Institute and later worked as an accountant at the Jamaica Broadcasting Corporation (JBC), balancing his professional life with his musical ambitions[1][2][3][4][5][7].

Fitzroy's musical breakthrough came with the help of producer Trevor Elliott, who produced his debut album 'Check For You Once' in 1981. The album, featuring hits like 'Youthman Penitentiary' and 'African Queen,' topped the Jamaican charts and found success in England and the United States (as 'Youthman Penitentiary'). Fitzroy was known for his socially conscious lyrics, often addressing issues of poverty, injustice, and cultural pride, and his music was deeply rooted in his Rastafarian beliefs. Over his career, he released several albums and became a regular performer at the annual Peter Tosh memorial concerts, earning recognition for his commitment to uplifting and conscious reggae[1][2][3].

Fitzroy's legacy is marked by his role as a pioneering voice in reggae, both as a performer and as a radio personality credited with helping introduce reggae to Jamaican airwaves. He remained closely connected to the people, frequently performing at benefit concerts and supporting community initiatives. Edi Fitzroy passed away on March 4, 2017, in May Pen, Clarendon Parish, Jamaica, leaving behind a body of work celebrated for its authenticity and social relevance[1][2][3][4][6][7].
