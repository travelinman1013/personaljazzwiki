## Biography
Iverson Minter, known professionally as Louisiana Red, was born on March 23, 1932, in Bessemer, Alabama, and became one of the most distinctive voices in American blues music.[1][3] His early life was marked by profound tragedy: his mother died of pneumonia shortly after his birth, and his father was lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1937 when Louisiana Red was just five years old.[1] Placed in an orphanage following his father's death, he was eventually raised by various relatives across multiple states including Mississippi, Pennsylvania, and California, experiences that would deeply inform the dark, emotionally raw quality of his later music.[2] At sixteen, he enlisted in the U.S. Army under false pretenses and served in Korea during the Korean War, where he performed blues at service clubs during his evenings.[1]

Louisiana Red's recording career began in earnest in the early 1960s after his discharge from military service, with his debut album *Lowdown Back Porch Blues* released in 1963.[1] Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, he maintained a prolific recording schedule across multiple labels including Chess, Checker, Atlas, Glover, Roulette, and Tomato, though he struggled to achieve sustained commercial success in the United States despite recording over 50 albums.[1] His musical style was rooted in the slide guitar mastery and emotional intensity of blues legends like Muddy Waters, John Lee Hooker, Elmore James, and Jimmy Reed, whom he idolized from his youth.[2] His lyrics were characterized by their autobiographical nature, haunting atmosphere, and exploration of darker themes, earning him recognition as a master of what critics described as the "dark side of the blues."[2]

Facing limited opportunities in his native country, Louisiana Red relocated to Germany in the early 1980s, settling in Hanover where he discovered far more receptive audiences for his elemental blues sound.[1] He continued performing and recording internationally until his death on February 25, 2012, at age 79, following a stroke.[1] His later work included innovative cross-genre collaborations, most notably the 1994 album *Blues Meets Rembetika*, which fused blues with Greek bouzouki music, and the critically acclaimed 2011 album *Memphis Mojo*.[1] Louisiana Red's legacy endures as that of an uncompromising artist who maintained artistic integrity throughout a challenging career, ultimately finding greater appreciation in Europe than in his homeland.

## Fun Facts
- Louisiana Red dodged the military draft three times in hopes that Harlem record producer Bobby Robinson would release a recording he had made for him, but Robinson never issued the record; he was eventually drafted into the Korean War anyway.[2]
- His first major hit, 'Red's Dream,' recorded for Roulette Records, sold a million copies, but Louisiana Red never received payment for it due to the label being run by notorious gangster Morris Levy, a situation that repeated with his follow-up 'Lowdown Back Porch Blues.'[2]
- Louisiana Red recorded under multiple stage names early in his career, including Rocky Fuller, Playboy Fuller, Cryin' Red, Rockin' Red, and Walkin' Slim, creating a mystique-laden roadmap through his early recorded history.[2]
- He was the subject of a 2005 documentary film titled *Red and Blues* directed by German-Finnish filmmaker Susanna Salonen, which chronicled his life touring across Germany and provided an intimate look at his experiences as an elderly African-American blues artist residing in Europe.[1]
