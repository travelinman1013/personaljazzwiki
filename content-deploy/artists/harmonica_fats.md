## Biography
Harvey Blackston, known professionally as Harmonica Fats, was born on September 8, 1927, in McDade, Bossier Parish, Louisiana. The oldest of 13 children, he was raised by his grandparents on a cotton farm where he was first exposed to the blues. He began playing harmonica at the age of four, citing legendary blues harmonica player Sonny Terry as his primary influence and idol. Seeking better opportunities, Blackston moved to Los Angeles in 1946 to live with his father, where he initially found work at a toilet seat manufacturing company, far from envisioning a career in music.

His path to becoming a professional musician took an unexpected turn in 1954 when a serious automobile accident left him unable to work. During his recovery, Blackston used the harmonica as self-prescribed therapy, practicing intensively for four months with an amplifier and microphone to perfect his technique. After two years of rehearsing over 300 songs with his band the Houserockers, he launched his professional career in 1956, initially performing under the name "Heavy Juice" before adopting the stage name Harmonica Fats. His breakthrough came in 1962 with a cover version of Hank Ballard's "Tore Up," which became a regional hit and reached number 102 on the Billboard Hot 100, establishing him as a sought-after session and touring musician.

Throughout his five-decade career spanning the 1950s to the 1990s, Harmonica Fats became a prolific session musician, contributing his harmonica skills to recordings by major artists including Sam Cooke, Bill Cosby, Ringo Starr, Lou Rawls, Bobby Darin, Tina Turner, and Etta James. His most significant artistic partnership was with blues guitarist Bernie Pearl, with whom he released four albums and co-founded Bee Bump Records. Their 1995 acoustic duo album "Two Heads Are Better" and 1996's "Blow, Fat Daddy, Blow!" showcased his witty songwriting and magnetic stage presence. By the mid-1970s, he reduced his touring schedule and took a job with Clorox while continuing to perform. Harmonica Fats passed away on January 3, 2000, at the age of 72 in Los Angeles, leaving behind a legacy as both a skilled blues harmonica player and versatile session musician.

## Fun Facts
- Harmonica Fats originally performed under the stage name 'Heavy Juice' before changing to Harmonica Fats, which created a new level of popularity for him and was inspired by his friendships with other harmonica players including George 'Harmonica' Smith, Johnnie Dyer, and Harmonica Slim.
- Before launching his band publicly in 1956, Fats insisted on rehearsing for two full years and learning over 300 songs to ensure they were ready. When he finally decided they were prepared, he simply loaded their equipment into a car and said 'let's go. I'm gonna find a place for us to play.'
- His hit song 'Tore Up' was a cover of a Hank Ballard song that fans frequently requested, but Fats modified some of the lyrics to make it his own. The song became so popular regionally that it nearly cracked the Billboard Hot 100, reaching number 102.
- Fats worked as a traveling solo musician for a period, driving around the country in a station wagon seeking gigs wherever he could find them, showcasing his dedication to performing even during leaner times in his career.
