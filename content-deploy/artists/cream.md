## Biography
Cream was a pioneering British rock band formed in London in 1966, widely recognized as one of the world's first 'supergroups.' The trio consisted of guitarist Eric Clapton, bassist and lead vocalist Jack Bruce, and drummer Ginger Baker. Each member brought a formidable musical pedigree: Clapton was already revered for his blues guitar work with the Yardbirds and John Mayall's Bluesbreakers, Bruce and Baker had played together in the Graham Bond Organisation, and all three were considered virtuosos in their respective fields. The band's formation was initiated by Baker, who approached Clapton with the idea, and Clapton insisted on bringing Bruce into the fold, despite Baker and Bruce's famously volatile relationship[1][2][3].

Cream's music blended elements of blues, jazz, and psychedelic rock, characterized by extended improvisations and a heavy, powerful sound that helped define the emerging genres of acid rock and blues rock. Their albums, including 'Fresh Cream' (1966), 'Disraeli Gears' (1967), and 'Wheels of Fire' (1968), produced hits like 'Sunshine of Your Love,' 'White Room,' and 'Crossroads.' The band's live performances became legendary for their energy and musicianship, often featuring lengthy instrumental jams that showcased each member's technical prowess[1][3][5].

Despite their immense success—selling over 15 million records in just two years—Cream was plagued by internal tensions, particularly between Bruce and Baker. The band disbanded in 1968 after a farewell tour, but their influence endured, shaping the sound of classic rock and inspiring countless musicians. Cream's legacy is that of a groundbreaking group that redefined the possibilities of rock music, both in the studio and on stage[1][3].
