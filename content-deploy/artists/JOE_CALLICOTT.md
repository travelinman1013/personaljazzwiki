## Biography
Joe Callicott, often known as 'Mississippi Joe Callicott,' was born and spent his entire life in Nesbit, Mississippi, a small town at the heart of the Delta blues tradition. He began playing guitar as a teenager, developing a delicate fingerpicking style and rich vocal delivery that would become his hallmark. In the late 1920s, Callicott formed a close musical partnership with fellow bluesman Garfield Akers, performing at local gatherings and house parties throughout the region. Their collaboration led to Callicott's first recording sessions in Memphis in 1929 and 1930, where he contributed to Akers' classic 'Cottonfield Blues' and recorded his own tracks, 'Fare Thee Well Blues' and 'Traveling Mama Blues.'

Despite his early promise, Callicott's recording career was brief, with only two songs issued in 1930. He largely withdrew from performing by the 1940s, working for decades at PEMCO Aviation and living in poverty with his wife, Sue, and their son. However, the blues revival of the 1960s brought renewed interest in his music. In 1967, folklorist George Mitchell recorded a series of sessions with Callicott, capturing his mature artistry and preserving his legacy for future generations. These recordings, along with his mentorship of young guitarist Kenny Brown shortly before his death in 1969, cemented Callicott's place as one of the most respected yet underrecognized figures in Delta blues history.

## Fun Facts
- Callicott worked at PEMCO Aviation for 38 years, likely in a custodial or freight-handling role, while living in poverty with his family.
- He was so underrecorded that only two tracks were issued during his early career, making his later rediscovery by folklorists especially significant.
- Callicott mentored a young Kenny Brown, who would skip school to learn guitar from him; Brown later became a well-known blues artist.
- His grave in Nesbit, Mississippi, was unmarked until 1995, when a memorial headstone was placed with support from Kenny Brown, Chris Strachwitz, and John Fogerty.
