## Biography
Jeff Lorber Fusion is the pioneering jazz fusion ensemble led by keyboardist, composer, and producer Jeff Lorber, who was born in Philadelphia in 1952. Lorber began playing piano at age four and, after performing with local R&B bands as a teenager, developed a passion for jazz while studying at Berklee College of Music. In the mid-1970s, Lorber relocated to Portland, Oregon, where he formed Jeff Lorber Fusion, debuting with their self-titled album in 1977. The group quickly gained recognition for blending traditional jazz with rock, R&B, funk, and electrified sounds, marked by complex harmonies and unconventional time signatures[1][3][4][5].

Throughout the late 1970s and early 1980s, Jeff Lorber Fusion became one of the most popular acts in the jazz fusion scene, propelled by relentless touring and a string of innovative recordings. As the jazz fusion movement evolved, Lorber transitioned toward contemporary jazz, dropping 'fusion' from his billing but continuing to experiment with genre-blending and improvisation. After a period focusing on session work and production, Lorber revived the Fusion name in the 2010s, collaborating with top jazz musicians and earning a Grammy Award for the album 'Prototype' in 2018[2][5][8].

Jeff Lorber Fusion's legacy lies in its role as a bridge between jazz fusion and the emergence of smooth jazz and urban jazz. Lorber's melodic, groove-oriented approach, combined with a commitment to improvisation, has influenced generations of musicians and helped define the sound of contemporary instrumental jazz[2][3][8].
