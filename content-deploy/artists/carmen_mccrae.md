## Biography
Carmen McRae (born April 8, 1920, in Harlem, New York) was an American jazz vocalist and pianist celebrated as one of the major interpreters of the Great American Songbook.[1][3] The daughter of Jamaican immigrants, she studied classical piano privately as a child and grew up in New York’s vibrant Black communities, spending early years in the Bronx before moving to Sugar Hill in Harlem.[1][6] As a teenager she was mentored by composer and pianist Irene Wilson Kitchings, who introduced her to McRae’s idol Billie Holiday; McRae wrote the song “Dream of Life,” which Holiday recorded in 1939, giving the young musician her first taste of professional recognition.[3][5][6] After graduating from Julia Richman High School in 1938, she worked briefly outside music, then began performing as a pianist and singer, winning an amateur contest at the Apollo Theater and entering the Harlem jazz circuit.[3]

In the 1940s McRae worked with leading big bands, first as a vocalist with Benny Carter’s orchestra, and later with the Count Basie and Earl Hines bands between 1944 and 1946.[1][3][5] She married bebop drummer Kenny Clarke in the mid‑1940s and recorded under the name **Carmen Clarke** with Mercer Ellington’s orchestra in 1946–47, also playing piano with his band.[1][3][5] A crucial step came when she was hired as an intermission pianist at Minton’s Playhouse in Harlem, where she absorbed modern jazz innovations and first encountered the music of Thelonious Monk, which shaped her harmonic and rhythmic sense.[1][4][5] By the early 1950s she was working with the Mat Mathews Quintet and in 1954 signed an important contract with Decca Records, quickly earning the title of Down Beat’s **Best New Female Singer** that year and making a high‑profile appearance at Carnegie Hall’s All‑Star Jazz Concert.[3][4][6]

From the mid‑1950s onward McRae led her own groups, toured internationally, and became especially popular in Japan, recording prolifically across club, concert, and studio settings.[1][2] Her vocal style—marked by a smoky timbre, behind‑the‑beat phrasing, conversational delivery, intricate but controlled scat, and an acute attention to lyrics—set her apart from contemporaries and led critics to place her alongside Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday, and Sarah Vaughan in the top rank of jazz singers.[1][4][5] She recorded with major jazz figures including Louis Armstrong, Dave Brubeck, Joe Pass, and George Shearing, and produced notable albums such as *Here to Stay* (late‑1950s sides), *Lover Man* (1962), and *The Great American Songbook* (1972).[1] In her later years she devoted a series of albums to tributes—honoring Nat King Cole, Billie Holiday, Thelonious Monk, and Sarah Vaughan—and continued to earn accolades, including six Grammy nominations, NAACP recognition, and a National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Masters Fellowship in 1994.[3][4][6] Ill health forced her retirement in the early 1990s, and she died on November 10, 1994, at her home in Beverly Hills, California, leaving a legacy as one of jazz’s most incisive and dramatic song stylists.[1][2][3]

(Her treatments of standards on albums like *Lover Man*, *The Great American Songbook*, and her tribute recordings are frequently cited in jazz education and criticism.) [From mid‑20th century onward, especially post‑1960s[1][3][4][5]]
