## Biography
Tim Maia (Sebastiño Rodrigues Maia) was born on September 28, 1942, in Tijuca, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, as the 18th of 19 siblings. A musical prodigy, he began singing by age eight, enrolled in a music academy by twelve, and formed his first band, Os Sputnikis, at fourteen with a group of ex-gang members. In his late teens, he moved to the United States to pursue his musical ambitions and received a comprehensive education in American popular music. However, his American dream was interrupted when he was arrested for smoking marijuana in a stolen car and subsequently deported back to Brazil. Upon returning to Rio in the late 1960s, Tim found himself completely out of step with the prevailing Brazilian musical movements of MPB and Tropicália, having spent years immersed in American soul and funk. His breakthrough came in 1970 when legendary singer Elis Regina discovered his song "These Are the Songs" and invited him to perform a duet on her album "Em Pleno Verño." This high-profile collaboration catapulted him into the spotlight and led to a recording contract with Philips Records, launching a revolutionary new chapter in Brazilian music.

Throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, Tim Maia became a transformative force in Brazilian popular music, pioneering the fusion of American soul, funk, and R&B with traditional Brazilian styles including samba, forró, baião, and bossa nova. His first four albums on Polydor Records established the blueprint for Brazilian soul music, featuring his distinctive dramatic and soaring vocal delivery that departed from the hushed tones of bossa nova. His 1970 debut album spent 24 weeks on the charts, and subsequent releases continued to achieve commercial success. Tim's musical innovations helped establish the Black Rio movement, an Afro-Brazilian music culture influenced by the U.S. civil rights struggle, and he became recognized as one of the biggest icons in Brazilian music. Beyond his recording career, Tim was an entrepreneur who founded Seroma, the first independent music label in Brazil.

Tim's later career took unconventional turns, including a period of intense involvement with the Superior Rational, a religious sect, during which he evangelized through music and attempted to spread the sect's philosophy to international figures like James Brown, Curtis Mayfield, and John Lennon. After leaving the cult, he reinvented himself with the 1978 album "Disco Club," which produced disco hits and demonstrated his ability to adapt to contemporary musical trends. Albums like "Nuvens" (1982) and "Descobridor dos Sete Mares" (1983) showcased his continued artistic vitality, balancing dance-oriented tracks with quiet-storm ballads. However, the 1980s also brought personal struggles with drug use and paranoia, which affected his reliability as a performer despite his continued commercial success. Tim Maia died on March 15, 1998, in Niterói, Rio de Janeiro, leaving behind a legacy as a pioneering figure who fundamentally transformed Brazilian music by introducing modern Black American music to the national pop landscape and creating a distinctly Brazilian interpretation of soul and funk.

## Fun Facts
- Tim was the 18th of 19 siblings born in Tijuca, Rio de Janeiro, and came from a musically obsessed family that shaped his early passion for music.
- After spending three years in the United States, Tim claimed he hadn't spoken a word of Portuguese, making his return to Brazil and reintegration into Brazilian music culture a significant challenge.
- During his involvement with the Superior Rational religious sect, Tim attempted to evangelize to international music icons James Brown, Curtis Mayfield, and John Lennon by sending them Portuguese translations of the sect's philosophical texts, convinced that 'the Superior Rational is made so that anyone can understand.'
- Tim famously described his musical philosophy as maintaining 'a balance: half of my songs are armpit-soakers and the other half are panty-soakers,' referring to the balance between energetic dance tracks and romantic ballads that defined his career.
