## Biography
Kenny Davern (born John Kenneth Davern on January 7, 1935, in Huntington, New York) was a celebrated American jazz clarinetist renowned for his expressive, lyrical playing and his dedication to traditional jazz and swing. Growing up in Queens, Davern was captivated by jazz after hearing Artie Shaw’s 'Concerto for Clarinet' and Pee Wee Russell’s distinctive soloing. He began his professional career astonishingly early, earning his union card at 16 and joining Jack Teagarden’s band at just 19, quickly establishing himself among New York’s jazz elite.

Davern’s career spanned over five decades, during which he played with many of the greats of jazz, including Phil Napoleon, Pee Wee Erwin, Ruby Braff, and Wild Bill Davison. In the 1970s, he co-founded the influential group Soprano Summit with Bob Wilber, blending clarinet and soprano saxophone in a unique, swinging context. Though best known for his mastery of the clarinet, Davern was also an adventurous musician, occasionally venturing into avant-garde jazz, notably collaborating with Steve Lacy, Steve Swallow, and Paul Motian. His style was marked by a warm, woody tone and a melodic focus, drawing deeply from the traditions of Louis Armstrong and Pee Wee Russell, yet always infused with his own personality and wit.

Davern’s legacy is that of a torchbearer for classic jazz clarinet, revered by critics and peers alike for his technical prowess and emotional depth. He recorded prolifically for labels such as Arbors, Music Masters, Jazzology, and Chiaroscuro, and was recognized internationally, including being named the Number One Clarinetist in the World by the English Jazz Journal Reader’s Poll. Davern passed away on December 12, 2006, in Sandia Park, New Mexico, leaving behind a rich, influential body of work that continues to inspire jazz musicians worldwide.
