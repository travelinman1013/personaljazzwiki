## Biography
Regina Spektor was born on February 18, 1980, in Moscow, Soviet Union, into a Russian-Jewish family deeply involved in music. Her father, Ilya, was a photographer and amateur violinist, while her mother, Bella, was a music professor. Spektor began classical piano studies at age six, practicing on a Petrof upright piano inherited from her grandfather. In 1989, her family emigrated to the Bronx, New York, fleeing ethnic and political discrimination, and she continued her musical education despite having to leave her piano behind, often practicing on tabletops until she found a piano at her synagogue.[2][1][3][6]

In New York, Spektor studied classical piano with Sonia Vargas, a professor at the Manhattan School of Music, and later attended Purchase College's Conservatory of Music, graduating with honors in 2001. Her exposure to Western rock and pop through her father's bootleg tapes, as well as the works of singer-songwriters like Joni Mitchell and Ani DiFranco, inspired her to write her own songs starting at age sixteen. Spektor's career developed through the anti-folk scene in downtown New York City, where she performed at venues such as SideWalk Cafe and self-released her first albums, '11:11' (2001) and 'Songs' (2002).[2][1][4][8]

Spektor's musical style is eclectic, blending elements of anti-folk, classical, punk, rock, jazz, and Jewish folk traditions. Her distinctive voice, inventive piano work, and quirky, personal songwriting have earned her critical acclaim and a dedicated following. She is recognized for her contributions to the anti-folk movement and for expanding the boundaries of singer-songwriter music, influencing a new generation of artists with her originality and emotional depth.[2][8][1]
