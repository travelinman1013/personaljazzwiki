## Biography
Kristin Diable is a critically acclaimed singer, songwriter, and producer known for her soulful, timeless sound that draws on the rich musical traditions of the American South. Born in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, Diable began writing songs as a child and quickly realized her calling after performing at a teenage battle of the bands. She spent formative years in New York before returning to New Orleans, where she has become a fixture in the city’s vibrant music scene[4][1].

Over the past two decades, Diable has built a diverse career as a performing artist, songwriter, and independent manager of her own label, Speakeasy Records. Her album 'Create Your Own Mythology,' recorded in Nashville with producer Dave Cobb, received critical acclaim from NPR, American Songwriter, and Southern Living, and her music has been featured in major television series such as 'Hawaii-Five-0,' 'True Blood,' and 'Virgin River.' Diable’s performances span intimate clubs to major festivals like Austin City Limits and the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Fest, often accompanied by her band, The City[1][4].

Diable’s musical style is characterized by evocative lyrics and melodies that blend elements of soul, Americana, and roots music, channeling the mystical and transcendent within everyday life. Beyond her own artistry, she is an active mentor and educator, serving as an adjunct professor at Loyola University New Orleans and supporting emerging musicians through initiatives like The Speakeasy Songwriter’s Revue. Her creative pursuits also extend to film, where she co-wrote and starred in the award-winning short 'Forever Waves.'[1][3]
