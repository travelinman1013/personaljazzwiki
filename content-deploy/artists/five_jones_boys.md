## Biography
The Five Jones Boys were an American vocal group that emerged in the mid-1930s, representing an important chapter in early African American entertainment history. The group initially performed as the Red Caps before relocating to California in 1935, where they renamed themselves the 5 Jones Boys. They gained significant attention for their innovative vocal arrangements and were immediately compared to the Mills Brothers for their distinctive 'vocal band' approach, which featured instrumental imitations performed entirely through vocals. Their unique sound earned them a contract with NBC following an audition in San Francisco, leading to their radio debut on the 'Carefree Carnival' broadcast on March 25, 1935, and subsequently their own show that ran from August 1935 through April 1937 across multiple California radio stations including KFWB and KFRC.

The group's lineup evolved throughout their career, with key members including Jimmy Springs (tenor and drums), David Patillo (second tenor, guitarist, and bassist), and others who rotated through the ensemble. Beyond their radio success, the Five Jones Boys expanded into film appearances and continued performing at various California venues including the Jade Cabaret and Club El Rio in El Cerrito. They recorded transcriptions for the Keystone Broadcasting System in 1941, performing covers and original material that showcased their versatility. The group's influence extended beyond their immediate era, as members like Jimmy Springs and David Patillo later collaborated with other vocal ensembles, demonstrating the interconnected nature of the early vocal group scene.

The Five Jones Boys represented a transitional moment in American popular music, bridging the gap between the novelty vocal groups of the 1920s and the more sophisticated harmony groups that would emerge in the 1940s and beyond. Their emphasis on vocal instrumentation and tight harmonies influenced the broader vocal group tradition, and their success on radio demonstrated the commercial viability of African American entertainment during the pre-war era. Though their recording legacy remains limited, their contributions to vocal group innovation and their pioneering radio presence secured their place in the history of American popular music.

## Fun Facts
- The Five Jones Boys were so innovative in their vocal instrumentation that they were immediately placed under NBC contract following a single audition in San Francisco, demonstrating the immediate impact of their distinctive sound.
- The group appeared in the 1939 film 'Stanley and Livingstone,' though not as singers but as extras playing 'African natives,' reflecting the limited opportunities for Black performers in Hollywood during that era.
- The group's name changed multiple times throughout their career—they began as the Red Caps, became the 5 Jones Boys in California, and later evolved into the 4 Toppers, reflecting the fluid nature of vocal group membership and branding in the 1930s-1940s.
- In 1941, the group celebrated their second anniversary at the Jade Cabaret in California, demonstrating sustained local popularity and regular performance opportunities despite limited national recording presence.
