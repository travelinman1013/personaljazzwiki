## Biography
Jacob Fred Jazz Odyssey (JFJO) is a pioneering jazz ensemble that originated in Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1994. Initially formed as a funky octet with MCs and horns, the group quickly distinguished itself through a genre-defying approach, blending elements of jazz, funk, electronic, and experimental music. Over the years, JFJO evolved into various configurations, including a trio in 1999, a quartet in 2007, and at times expanding to a nine-piece ensemble, reflecting their commitment to musical exploration and reinvention[3][5].

The band's core has long centered around pianist Brian Haas, whose leadership and vision have guided JFJO through decades of creative output. Their music is characterized by improvisational daring, rhythmic complexity, and a willingness to tackle ambitious conceptual projects, such as 'The Race Riot Suite,' which explores the history of the 1921 Tulsa race massacre[2][8]. JFJO's sound draws from jazz traditions while incorporating modern influences like acid jazz, nu jazz, and jazz funk, making them a unique force in contemporary jazz.

JFJO's legacy is marked by their relentless touring, innovative recordings, and a reputation for pushing the boundaries of jazz. Their influence extends beyond their own discography, inspiring younger musicians and contributing to the evolution of jazz in the Midwest and beyond. The group has become an institution in modern music, inventing its own language and remaining true to a spirit of constant change[5][9].
