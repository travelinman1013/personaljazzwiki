## Biography
Emilie Sunshine Hamilton, known professionally as **EmiSunshine**, is an American singer‑songwriter and multi‑instrumentalist from Madisonville, Tennessee, whose music bridges country, Americana, bluegrass, blues, gospel and old‑time roots traditions.[1][2][5] Born on June 8, 2004 to musician/engineer Randall Hamilton and songwriter/nurse Alisha Karol Hamilton, she grew up in a tightly knit musical family and began singing with her grandmothers in church as a small child.[1] Her parents recall noticing her perfect pitch as early as nine months old, and by age four she was performing “You Are My Sunshine” at a family wedding and soon singing in churches and festivals around East Tennessee.[1][6] At seven, she recorded her first two independent albums, *Strong as the Tall Pine* and *Wide River to Cross*, in her father’s studio with help from her father and grandfather “PaPaw Bill.”[1][6]

EmiSunshine’s national breakthrough came at age nine when a fan‑shot video of her singing Jimmie Rodgers’ “Blue Yodel No. 6” at a flea market went viral on YouTube, leading to invitations to perform on NBC’s *Today* show and her 2014 debut at the Grand Ole Opry.[1][2] She began opening for legends such as Willie Nelson, Loretta Lynn, Tanya Tucker and Rhonda Vincent while releasing original material, including the album *Black Sunday ’35* as a child and later projects that showcased increasingly mature songwriting.[1][2] Often describing her style as “old‑time music turned upside‑down,” she writes about subjects uncommon for her age—murder, poverty, domestic violence, addiction, politics, autism and family dysfunction—alongside songs of resilience and equality, drawing ideas from news stories and everyday conversations.[1][2] Rolling Stone named her one of “10 new country artists you need to know,” and she has appeared on *Today*, *Little Big Shots*, *Pickler & Ben*, *Song of the Mountains*, *WoodSongs Old‑Time Radio Hour* and other national platforms.[1][2]

As her career developed, EmiSunshine built a reputation as a prolific songwriter and dynamic live performer, fronting her band The Rain and playing ukulele, guitar and other instruments.[2][9] She co‑produced her 2019 studio album *Family Wars* with four‑time Grammy‑winner Tony Brown, collaborating with respected Nashville songwriters and featuring guests like Jim Lauderdale and The McCrary Sisters.[1] In 2018, she wrote and performed two original songs—“Johnny, June and Jesus” and “Danny Ray”—for the Grammy‑nominated Elvis Presley documentary *The King*, and in 2019 she received the ASCAP Foundation Desmond Child Anthem Award for musical excellence.[2] Her 2022 solo album *Diamonds* was praised by roots publications such as *No Depression* and *American Songwriter* for filtering traditional roots sounds through a modern pop‑aware lens, highlighting her evolution from child prodigy to mature artist while remaining grounded in East Tennessee roots music.[1][2]
