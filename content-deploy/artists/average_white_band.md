## Biography
Average White Band (often abbreviated **AWB**) is a Scottish funk and soul group formed in London in 1972 by bassist/vocalist Alan Gorrie and saxophonist Malcolm “Molly” Duncan, drawing together a circle of Scottish musicians who had first played together in the 1960s club scene around Dundee and Perth.[1][2][4] The classic early‑70s lineup solidified with guitarist/vocalist Owen “Onnie” McIntyre, saxophonist/keyboardist Roger Ball, drummer Robbie McIntosh, and guitarist/bassist/vocalist Hamish Stuart, all of whom had cut their teeth backing visiting American soul artists and exploring the jazzier side of R&B in projects like the Blue Workshop, the Scots of St. James, Brian Auger’s Oblivion Express, Forever More, and Dream Police.[1][2] After regrouping in London, they began jamming together and, inspired by a quip from a listener—“too much for the average white man”—they adopted the self‑deprecating name Average White Band.[1][2][3]

Their breakthrough came in 1973 supporting Eric Clapton at his comeback concert, which led Clapton’s tour manager Bruce McCaskill to take them on, move them to the United States, and secure a deal with Atlantic Records.[1][2][3] Recorded in Los Angeles with producer Arif Mardin, their second album *AWB* (1974), known as “The White Album,” hit No. 1 on the US charts and produced the Grammy‑nominated instrumental hit “Pick Up the Pieces,” firmly establishing them as one of the premier funk and R&B bands of the decade.[1][2][6] Through the mid‑to‑late 1970s they released a string of influential albums—*Cut the Cake*, *Soul Searching*, *Person to Person*, *Warmer Communications*, *Feel No Fret*, and the collaborative *Benny & Us* with Ben E. King—scoring R&B and pop hits such as “Cut the Cake,” “Queen of My Soul,” and later the disco‑era anthem “Let’s Go Round Again.”[1][2] Although commercial fortunes waned in the early 1980s and the original lineup dissolved, various configurations of AWB, anchored by Gorrie and McIntyre, continued to record (*Aftershock*, *Soul Tattoo*, *Face to Face*) and tour internationally, preserving their tight horn arrangements, sophisticated harmonies, and deep-pocket grooves that have made them a staple for soul, funk, and acid‑jazz audiences.[1][2][4][6]

Musically, Average White Band fused the rhythmic drive of James Brown and the Meters with jazz‑inflected horn writing and a distinctly Scottish, working‑class sensibility, absorbing ideas from American R&B, jazz‑fusion, and West Coast soul they encountered while touring and recording in Los Angeles.[1][2][5] Their precise ensemble playing, melodic bass lines, and sax‑driven riffs created a sound both technically sharp and dance‑floor friendly, leading to enduring respect from Black R&B audiences in the 1970s and beyond, including sold‑out arena tours and collaborations with US soul royalty.[1][5][6] AWB’s recordings have been sampled extensively by hip‑hop, R&B, and pop producers, ensuring that their grooves remain part of the musical vocabulary for subsequent generations, and their status as one of the few predominantly white bands to be fully embraced within 1970s funk and soul circles has given them a singular legacy in the genre’s history.[2][5][6][7]

## Fun Facts
- The band’s name came from a listener’s remark that their sound was “too much for the average white man,” a line that stuck and, with a bit of self‑deprecating humor, became Average White Band.[1][2][3]
- AWB’s big break arrived when they opened Eric Clapton’s 1973 comeback concert; Clapton’s tour manager Bruce McCaskill was so impressed that he became their manager and personally financed their push into the US market.[2][3]
- Their signature instrumental “Pick Up the Pieces” was a surprise smash, helping the album *AWB* reach No. 1 in the United States and earning the group a Grammy nomination, despite being largely an instrumental track from a Scottish band in a predominantly American R&B field.[1][2][6]
- In 1977 AWB released *Benny & Us*, a full collaborative album with soul legend Ben E. King, an unusual move for a funk band that effectively cast them as the backing group for one of their own vocal heroes.[1][2]

### Artists Influenced
- [[hiphop_and_randb_producers_and_artists_various|Hip‑hop and R&B producers and artists (various)]] - AWB’s tight funk grooves—especially “Pick Up the Pieces” and other 1970s tracks—have been widely sampled, making their sound a building block for later hip‑hop, R&B, and pop productions. (Sampling of tracks from *AWB*, *Cut the Cake*, and other 1970s albums in numerous hip‑hop and R&B songs (exact titles vary by artist).) [Late 1980s onward as sampling culture grew in hip‑hop and R&B.[2][5][6]]
- [[acid_jazz_and_neosoul_bands|Acid jazz and neo‑soul bands]] - Their blend of horn‑driven funk, jazz harmony, and soulful vocals helped shape the template for later British and international acid‑jazz and neo‑soul groups.
