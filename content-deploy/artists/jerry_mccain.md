## Biography
Jerry McCain, often billed as Jerry "Boogie" McCain, was born June 18, 1930, near Gadsden, Alabama, into a poor family where music was a household staple. He began playing harmonica at age five, accompanying jukebox records at his father's Green Front Cafe, and was influenced early by local itinerant musicians. By his teens, McCain was fronting a jug band on local radio and had developed a distinctive, aggressive harmonica style that would set him apart in the Southern blues scene[1][2][3][4].

McCain's professional career launched in the early 1950s when he recorded for Trumpet Records, often with his brother Walter on drums. He later signed with Excello Records, where he developed his amplified harmonica sound and penned unconventional blues lyrics, producing classics like "The Jig's Up" and "My Next Door Neighbor." His 1960 single "She's Tough" became a blues harmonica benchmark, inspiring later artists such as Kim Wilson of The Fabulous Thunderbirds. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, McCain performed regionally and worked various jobs to support himself, but his recording career revived in the late 1980s with Ichiban Records, leading to a prolific output and collaborations with blues legends[1][2][3][4].

McCain's legacy is marked by his original songwriting, energetic performances, and innovative harmonica technique. He released over thirty albums, toured internationally, and was honored by his hometown with an annual festival day. In 1997, he performed a blues harmonica concerto at Lincoln Center, and in 2007 received the Alabama Folk Heritage Award. McCain remained active in music until his death in 2012, influencing generations of blues musicians and earning recognition as one of Alabama's most celebrated musical figures[1][3][4].
