## Biography
Benjamin Baruch Ambrose (1896–1971), known professionally as Bert Ambrose, was an English bandleader and violinist born in London (though some sources mention Warsaw origins). He began his career as a violinist, moving to New York in his early 20s where he played with bands at Reisenweber's restaurant and the Palais Royal, eventually leading his own 15-piece band by age 20. In 1922, he returned to London to lead a seven-piece band at the Embassy Club, later moving to the May Fair Hotel in 1927, where his orchestra gained fame through BBC broadcasts and recordings for Brunswick, HMV, and Decca.[1][2][4]

Ambrose & His Orchestra became one of Britain's top dance bands in the 1930s, known for a polished style blending sweet ballads, swing, and Ellington-inspired jazz, featuring exceptional musicianship and arrangements by Sid Phillips. The band performed at prestigious venues like the May Fair and Ciro's Club (co-owned with Jack Harris), recorded hits like 'When Day Is Done,' and collaborated with songwriters Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart. Ambrose retired from performing in 1940 amid air raids but continued recording until 1947; several band members joined the RAF's Squadronaires. He later toured with the Ambrose Octet and managed artists.[1][2][3]

In the 1950s–1960s, rock and roll challenged his career, leading to small club gigs, but Ambrose revived through discovering and promoting singer Kathy Kirby, with whom he had a long personal relationship. His legacy endures as a pioneer of British big band swing, ranking with American counterparts, with prolific recordings capturing the era's dance music sophistication.[1][2][4]
