## Biography
James Brandon Lewis is an acclaimed American tenor saxophonist, composer, and bandleader born in Buffalo, New York. Raised in a deeply musical environment—his father was a pastor and his mother an educator—Lewis began his musical journey as a self-taught clarinetist before focusing on the saxophone. He attended the Buffalo Academy for the Visual and Performing Arts, then earned his undergraduate degree at Howard University, where he studied with jazz luminaries such as Geri Allen, Benny Golson, Bill Pierce, and Wallace Roney. After a period performing gospel music in Colorado, he completed a master's degree at CalArts, studying under influential figures like Charlie Haden, Wadada Leo Smith, Vinny Golia, and Alphonso Johnson.[1][3][4]

Lewis's career has been marked by a restless creative spirit and a deep commitment to melody and storytelling. He released his debut album, 'Moments,' in 2010, and quickly gained attention for his emotive sound and innovative approach. His 2021 album 'The Jesup Wagon,' inspired by George Washington Carver, was a critical breakthrough, earning Album of the Year honors from Jazz Times and DownBeat. Lewis’s music draws from gospel, folk-blues, brass bands, and avant-garde jazz, blending tradition with experimentation. He is also known for his work with the poetry and music ensemble Heroes Are Gang Leaders and for leading the Red Lily Quintet.[1][2][3]

Lewis is celebrated for his robust, melodic tenor saxophone style, which bridges the sacred and the secular, the past and the future. His improvisations are marked by a focus on short, infectious motifs and a willingness to stretch and mutate melodic ideas. He has become a significant voice in contemporary jazz, praised by legends such as Sonny Rollins, and is recognized for both his technical mastery and his ability to convey deep emotion through music.[2][4]
