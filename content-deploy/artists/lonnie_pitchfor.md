## Biography
Lonnie Pitchford was born on October 8, 1955, near Lexington, Mississippi, and raised in a rural, musically rich environment just outside the town[1][2]. From an early age, Pitchford was immersed in the sounds of blues and gospel, building his first one-string diddley bow at age five and quickly mastering it alongside the guitar, piano, double bass, and harmonica[2][3]. His talent was recognized early by folklorist Worth Long, who booked him to perform at the Smithsonian Festival of American Folklife in Washington, D.C., when Pitchford was still a teenager—an appearance that brought him national attention and solidified his reputation as a torchbearer of the Delta blues tradition[2][5]. Pitchford’s career was marked by deep respect for the roots of Mississippi blues; he learned directly from Eugene Powell (of the Mississippi Sheiks) and became a protégé of Robert Lockwood Jr., who himself was the stepson of blues legend Robert Johnson[1][2]. Despite his prodigious skill and dynamic live performances, Pitchford’s recorded output was limited, with only one solo album, *All Round Man* (1994), released during his lifetime[1][3]. He balanced music with carpentry, occasionally touring but never achieving widespread commercial success. Pitchford’s life was cut short by AIDS-related pneumonia on November 8, 1998, at age 43[1][3]. He is remembered as one of the few young African American musicians of his generation to authentically carry forward the Delta and country blues traditions, and his grave near Elmore James in the Newport Baptist Church Cemetery is a pilgrimage site for blues enthusiasts[1][3].
