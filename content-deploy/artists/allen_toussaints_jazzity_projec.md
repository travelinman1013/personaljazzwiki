## Biography
Allen Toussaint, born January 14, 1938, in New Orleans' Gert Town neighborhood, grew up in a musical family and began playing piano without formal training, composing songs by age 9. His early career in the 1950s involved gigging with local acts like Shirley & Lee's band, substituting for Fats Domino and Huey 'Piano' Smith, and recording his debut album The Wild Side of New Orleans, featuring 'Java,' which later became a hit for others. By 1957, he produced his first success with Lee Allen's 'Walking with Mr. Lee,' transitioning to studio work at venues like the Dew Drop Inn and with Dave Bartholomew.[1][2][3][4][6][7]

Toussaint's career peaked in the 1960s as a founding partner, songwriter, producer, and arranger for Minit Records, crafting R&B hits for Ernie K-Doe ('Mother-in-Law'), Irma Thomas ('It's Raining'), Benny Spellman ('Fortune Teller'), and Aaron Neville. He co-founded Sea-Saint Studios in 1973 with Marshall Sehorn, producing smashes like Dr. John's 'Right Place Wrong Time,' LaBelle's 'Lady Marmalade,' and his own albums From a Whisper to a Scream and Southern Nights, whose title track became a Glen Campbell hit. His style blended lush New Orleans R&B, funk, and soul with piano-driven arrangements that influenced British Invasion bands like the Rolling Stones and Yardbirds.[1][2][3][4]

In later decades, Toussaint explored jazz on The Bright Mississippi (2009), co-founded NYNO Records (1996), and earned a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction (1998). A civic leader, he co-founded New Orleans Artists Against Hunger and Homelessness. He passed away on November 9, 2015, after a concert in Madrid, leaving a legacy as a New Orleans R&B architect through collaborations with The Band, Paul McCartney, Elvis Costello, and Eric Clapton.[1][2][4][5][7]
