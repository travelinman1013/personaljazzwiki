## Biography
Randy Weston (April 6, 1926 – September 1, 2018) was an American jazz pianist and composer renowned for his pioneering integration of African rhythms into jazz. Born and raised in Brooklyn, New York, Weston grew up in a culturally rich environment that nurtured his early musical interests. After serving in the U.S. Army during World War II, he began performing with rhythm-and-blues bands in the late 1940s, including Bull Moose Jackson and Eddie 'Cleanhead' Vinson, before establishing himself as a jazz leader in the 1950s. His early recordings, such as 'Cole Porter in a Modern Mood' (1954) and 'Little Niles' (1958), showcased his compositional talent and distinctive piano style, which drew inspiration from jazz greats like Duke Ellington and Thelonious Monk.

Weston's lifelong fascination with Africa profoundly shaped his music and career. He first traveled to Nigeria in 1961 and later settled in Morocco, where he owned a nightclub from 1968 to 1972. His landmark 1960 album 'Uhuru Afrika' celebrated African independence movements and was notable for its collaboration with poet Langston Hughes. Weston’s music is characterized by its bold melodies, blues-based harmonies, and the prominent use of African percussion and rhythms, often featuring hand percussionists in his ensembles. Throughout his career, he collaborated closely with arranger Melba Liston and maintained a repertoire largely consisting of original compositions. Weston remained musically active into his 80s, performing internationally and receiving numerous honors, including being named a Jazz Master by the National Endowment for the Arts in 2001.

Weston's legacy is that of a cultural ambassador who bridged African and African-American musical traditions. He is remembered for his innovative approach to jazz, his commitment to exploring the African roots of the genre, and his influence on generations of musicians. His autobiography, 'African Rhythms,' published in 2010, chronicles his journey as both an artist and an advocate for the recognition of Africa’s central role in world music.
