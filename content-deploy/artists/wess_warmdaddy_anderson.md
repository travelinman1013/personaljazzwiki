## Biography
Wessell 'Warmdaddy' Anderson is an American jazz alto and sopranino saxophonist born in 1966 in Brooklyn, New York. He grew up in the tough Bedford-Stuyvesant and Crown Heights neighborhoods of Brooklyn, where he was introduced to jazz at an early age. Anderson began playing the saxophone at age 10 and quickly developed a passion for the instrument, attending Jazzmobile workshops in Harlem where he received formal training and mentorship from established jazz musicians. His early immersion in New York's vibrant jazz scene shaped his musical sensibilities and technical prowess.

Anderson's professional career reached significant heights when he became one of the original members of New York City's prestigious Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra, establishing himself as a respected figure in contemporary jazz. His nickname 'Warmdaddy' reflects his approachable personality and the warmth he brings to his performances. Beyond his work as a performer, Anderson has been committed to music education, joining the Michigan State University Jazz Studies program faculty in 2006 to mentor the next generation of jazz musicians. His contributions to jazz have been recognized across multiple platforms, from concert performances to educational initiatives.

Anderson's musical journey has not been without challenges. In July 2007, he suffered a severe stroke while serving on the MSU faculty, which temporarily interrupted his career. However, demonstrating remarkable resilience, he gradually worked his way back to performing and contributing to the jazz community. His career represents both the heights of artistic achievement in contemporary jazz and the determination required to overcome personal adversity while maintaining a commitment to the art form.
