## Biography
Kate Fagan emerged in the late 1970s after immersing herself in the punk and new wave scenes of London and New York dance floors, inspired by powerhouse frontwomen like Patti Smith and Debbie Harry. Moving to Chicago from New York, she critiqued the shallow 'hipster' disco culture in her self-released 1980 single 'I Don't Wanna Be Too Cool' on Disturbing Records, which she co-founded; it became the best-selling local single at Wax Trax! Records, embraced by DJs for its surf-inspired drum machine, plucky bass, and defiant lyrics.[1][2] As frontwoman of punk group BB Spin, she opened for The Ramones, and organized 'Rock Against Racism' concerts, diving headfirst into Chicago's authentic punk scene.[1][4]

In 1980, Fagan co-founded the ska band Heavy Manners, whose legendary dance parties and electrifying shows opened for The Clash, Grace Jones, Peter Tosh, The English Beat, and others at venues like Park West and Aragon Ballroom; she was voted Chicago's top female performer multiple times.[1][2][4] She composed tracks like 'Master Of Passion' and 'Come Over' for her rock opera 'The Kissing Concept,' a semi-autobiographical story of 70s/80s nightclub life, premiered at Park West and Limelight; the 2023 expanded reissue of 'I Don't Wanna Be Too Cool' by Captured Tracks includes unreleased songs from it, with 'Say It' featuring production by Peter Tosh and Bob Marley's guitarist Donald Kinsey.[1] Her style blends punk, new wave, ska, and minimalist bass-driven dance tracks with politically charged, rebellious lyrics.[2]

Now based in New Orleans, Fagan remains active, releasing singles like '2 Good 2 B True' (ska-baroque fusion), 'Ho Ho Ho Holiday Party' (2021), and 'Say It' B/W 'Cover it Up' (2023), while shaping new musicians through Girls Camp of Rock chapters; 2016 and 2023 reissues solidified her cult status as a trailblazing frontwoman.[1][2]
