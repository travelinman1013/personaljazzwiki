## Biography
Beoga, an Irish folk band meaning 'lively' or 'vivid' in Irish, formed in 2002 at the All-Ireland Fleadh in County Kerry, with original members Liam Bradley (piano, keyboards), Damian McKee (button accordion), Seán Óg Graham (multi-instrumentalist including accordion, guitars, bouzouki, banjo, low whistle), and Eamon Murray (bodhrán, percussion) hailing from Counties Antrim and Londonderry in Northern Ireland. Niamh Dunne from County Limerick joined in 2005 on vocals, fiddle, and viola, completing the lineup. Their debut album 'A Lovely Madness' released in 2004 was well-received, followed by 'Mischief' in 2007, which earned high praise including a 9.5/10 from Hot Press.[1][2][3]

The band's career advanced with 'The Incident' in 2009, shortlisted for a Grammy nomination in Best Contemporary World Music Album and honored with a U.S. House of Representatives Certificate of Congressional Recognition. Described by The Wall Street Journal as 'the most exciting new traditional band to emerge from Ireland this century,' Beoga blended traditional Irish music with innovative elements. High-profile collaborations with Ed Sheeran on his 2017 album '÷' included co-writing 'Galway Girl' (over 1.4 billion Spotify streams) and featuring on 'Nancy Mulligan,' leading to a Glastonbury Festival performance for 150,000 people. Later releases like 'Carousel' (2020), 'Breathe' (2021), and 'Phases' (2025) show evolution toward pop influences while rooted in tradition.[2][3][5]

Beoga's musical style is characterized by energetic traditional Irish folk, incorporating fiddles, accordions, bodhrán, and vocals with contemporary production and experimentation, earning critical acclaim and a lasting presence in the Irish folk scene for over two decades.
