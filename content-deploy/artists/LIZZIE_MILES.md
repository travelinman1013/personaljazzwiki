## Biography
Lizzie Miles, born Elizabeth Mary Landreaux on March 31, 1895, in New Orleans, Louisiana, emerged as one of the early voices of classic blues and jazz. Raised in a Creole family in the Faubourg Marigny neighborhood, she grew up speaking French and Kouri-Vini, and began singing in her Catholic church as a child[3][4]. By her teens, she was performing with top New Orleans musicians including King Oliver, Kid Ory, and Bunk Johnson, quickly establishing herself in the vibrant local music scene[1][2][4].

Miles's career flourished as she toured the southern vaudeville and minstrel circuits, worked in circuses, and eventually moved to Chicago in the late 1910s. There, she performed with Elgar's Creole Orchestra, Freddie Keppard, and King Oliver’s Creole Jazz Band[1][2]. In 1922, she relocated to New York, making her recording debut with Okeh Records and collaborating with Sam Wooding and A.J. Piron. Her versatility allowed her to sing pop ballads, vaudeville standards, and jazz-infused blues, both in French and English[4][5]. She toured Europe in 1924–1925, performing in Paris before returning to New York, where she remained active through the 1930s, working with artists like Fats Waller and Paul Barbarin. After a period of illness and semi-retirement, Miles revived her career in the 1950s, notably recording with the Bob Scobey Band and appearing at the Monterey Jazz Festival before retiring in 1959[1][5].

Miles was known for her expressive voice and emotional delivery, preferring to be recognized as a singer of many styles rather than solely a blues artist[4][5]. Her legacy includes nearly seventy recordings and a reputation as the "Creole Songbird." She influenced the development of jazz and blues, bridging early New Orleans traditions with later revivals. Lizzie Miles died of a heart attack on March 17, 1963[1][5].
