## Biography
Boureima 'Vieux' Farka Touré, born on March 12, 1981, in Niafunké, Mali, is a renowned Malian singer, composer, and guitarist, best known as the son of the legendary 'King of Desert Blues' Ali Farka Touré, who passed away in 2006. Coming from a family lineage of soldiers, Vieux initially faced opposition from his father, who wanted him to pursue a military career rather than music due to the hardships he had endured. Despite this, Vieux trained as a drummer and calabash player at Mali's Institut National des Arts in Bamako, secretly taking up the guitar in 2001. With encouragement from family friend and kora master Toumani Diabaté, he gained his father's blessing shortly before Ali's death.[1][3][6]

Vieux launched his career with a self-titled debut album in 2007, featuring posthumous contributions from his father on a few tracks, which Ali proudly shared in his final days, honoring the desert blues tradition rooted in West African music and echoed in American blues. His second album, *Fondo* (2009), marked a bold evolution, blending his father's roots with rock, Latin, and other African influences, earning critical acclaim and peaking at #5 on Billboard's World Albums chart. Subsequent releases like *Mon Pays* (2013), a cultural preservation project dedicated to Mali featuring Sidiki Diabaté; the live *Samba* (2017), recorded in Woodstock, NY; and *Les Racines* (2022), returning to traditional Songhai desert blues with Malian collaborators like Amadou Bagayoko and Mamadou Sidiki Diabaté, showcase his maturation. Nicknamed 'The Hendrix of the Sahara,' Vieux's style fuses hypnotic desert blues with funk, reggae, and global elements.[1][2][3][4]

A passionate advocate for Mali, Vieux founded the charity Amahrec Sahel in 2012 to support humanitarian efforts, including school supplies, orphanages, and instruments for young musicians, and serves as director of the Ali Farka Touré Foundation to preserve his father's legacy and promote Malian culture. His performances, such as at the 2010 FIFA World Cup opening ceremony alongside global stars, have elevated him as a leading voice in world music.[1][2]
