## Biography
The Ronettes were an iconic American girl group formed in New York City's Washington Heights in 1959 by sisters Veronica 'Ronnie' Bennett (later Ronnie Spector), Estelle Bennett, and their cousin Nedra Talley. Growing up in a musical household, the trio began harmonizing as children at their grandmother's home, influenced by artists like Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers and Little Anthony and the Imperials, initially performing as the Darling Sisters or Ronnie and the Relatives. They gained early exposure by winning an Apollo Theater talent contest and dancing at the Peppermint Lounge, where they spontaneously sang Ray Charles' 'What I Say,' leading to a deal with Colpix Records in 1961 for singles like 'I Want a Boy' that achieved modest local success.[1][2][4][5]

In 1963, the group signed with producer Phil Spector at Philles Records, who transformed their image with towering beehive hairdos, heavy makeup, and his signature 'Wall of Sound' production, creating hits like 'Be My Baby,' 'Baby I Love You,' and 'Walking in the Rain.' Their sultry yet sweet style blended rock and roll, rhythm and blues, and girl group pop, making them stand out as tough and vulnerable. They released their only studio album, 'Presenting the Fabulous Ronettes Featuring Veronica,' in 1964, toured with the Rolling Stones in the UK, and became the only girl group to open for the Beatles in the US in 1966.[1][2][3][4][5]

The Ronettes disbanded in 1967 amid shifting musical tastes and Spector's controlling influence; Ronnie married him in 1968 but left in 1972, later reforming versions of the group briefly in the 1970s and pursuing a solo career. Their legacy endures as pioneers of the girl group era, with 'Be My Baby' defining the genre through Spector's innovative production.[1][4][5]
