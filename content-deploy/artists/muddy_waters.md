## Biography
Muddy Waters, born McKinley Morganfield on April 4, 1913 (some sources cite 1915) near Rolling Fork, Mississippi, grew up on the Stovall Plantation near Clarksdale after the early death of his mother. Raised by his grandmother, he earned the nickname 'Muddy' from playing in the muddy waters of the Mississippi as a child. Immersed in the Delta blues tradition, Waters taught himself harmonica and guitar, emulating local legends like Son House, Robert Johnson, and Charley Patton. His formative years were spent working as a sharecropper and performing at local gatherings, developing a powerful, emotive style rooted in the rural South.[1][2][3][5]

Waters' career took a pivotal turn in 1941 when folklorist Alan Lomax recorded him for the Library of Congress, capturing his raw Delta sound. In 1943, he moved to Chicago, where he adapted his music to the urban environment by switching to electric guitar. This innovation helped define the modern Chicago blues sound. By the early 1950s, Waters and his band—including Little Walter, Jimmy Rogers, Otis Spann, and Willie Dixon—recorded a string of blues classics for Chess Records, such as 'Hoochie Coochie Man,' 'I'm Ready,' and 'I Just Want to Make Love to You.' His music not only shaped the Chicago blues scene but also laid the groundwork for the rise of rock and roll and inspired a generation of British and American musicians.[1][4][5]

Muddy Waters' legacy as the 'father of modern Chicago blues' is profound. His electrified Delta blues style bridged rural and urban musical traditions, influencing countless artists across genres. His performances, including a landmark set at the 1960 Newport Jazz Festival, and his tours in England, helped spark the British blues boom and cemented his status as a foundational figure in 20th-century music.[1][4][5]
