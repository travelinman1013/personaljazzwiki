## Biography
Brian Blade & The Fellowship Band is a critically acclaimed jazz group founded in 1997 by drummer and composer Brian Blade and pianist Jon Cowherd. Blade, born in 1970 in Shreveport, Louisiana, was immersed in gospel and church music from an early age, influenced by his family's deep involvement in the Zion Baptist Church. After initially studying violin and singing in the choir, Blade shifted his focus to drums, developing his skills under the mentorship of local musicians and his older brother. His move to New Orleans in 1988 to attend Loyola University exposed him to a vibrant jazz scene and a host of master musicians, laying the groundwork for his future collaborations and musical direction.[1][2][4]

The Fellowship Band emerged from Blade's partnership with Cowherd, whom he met during his university years. The group quickly established a reputation for blending jazz with elements of gospel, folk, and Americana, creating a sound marked by lyricism, spiritual undertones, and dynamic interplay. The original lineup included saxophonists Myron Walden and Melvin Butler, bassist Chris Thomas, guitarist Jeff Parker (later replaced by Kurt Rosenwinkel), and pedal steel guitarist Dave Easley. Their debut album, 'Brian Blade Fellowship' (1998), set the tone for a discography that now spans seven albums, including 'Perceptual' (2000), 'Season of Changes' (2008), 'Landmarks' (2014), 'Body and Shadow' (2017), 'Live from the Archives' (2022), and 'Kings Highway' (2023).[3][5][6]

The band is celebrated for its ability to transcend traditional jazz boundaries, incorporating influences from Blade's church upbringing, the New Orleans jazz tradition, and the singer-songwriter ethos of artists like Joni Mitchell. Over more than two decades, The Fellowship Band has become one of the most distinctive and enduring ensembles in contemporary jazz, known for its communal spirit, innovative compositions, and the deep musical connections among its members.[8][4]
