## Biography
Rickie Lee Jones, born November 8, 1954, in Chicago, Illinois, is an American singer-songwriter renowned for her eclectic musical style and expressive vocals[1][3]. Raised in a turbulent household with a musician father, Jones moved frequently during her childhood and eventually left home as a teenager, living a bohemian lifestyle before settling in Los Angeles at age nineteen[2]. There, she performed in clubs and open-mic nights, developing her distinctive blend of jazz, folk, R&B, and pop.

Jones's breakthrough came with her self-titled debut album in 1979, which featured the hit single "Chuck E.'s in Love" and earned her the Grammy Award for Best New Artist in 1980[1][2][3]. Her follow-up album, "Pirates" (1981), solidified her reputation for sophisticated songwriting and genre-blending, peaking at No. 5 on the Billboard 200 and earning critical acclaim[1][2]. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Jones continued to experiment with musical forms, releasing albums such as "The Magazine" (1984), "Flying Cowboys" (1989), and "Pop Pop" (1991), and winning a second Grammy for her jazz duet "Makin' Whoopee" with Dr. John in 1990[1][2].

Jones is celebrated for her innovative approach to songwriting, weaving jazz phrasing, poetic lyricism, and pop sensibility into her work[1]. Her legacy includes influencing a generation of singer-songwriters with her genre-defying sound and emotive storytelling. Over her five-decade career, Jones has released 15 studio albums and remains a vital figure in American music, with her 2023 album "Pieces of Treasure" earning her an eighth Grammy nomination[1].
