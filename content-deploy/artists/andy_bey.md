## Biography
Andy Bey (Andrew W. Bey Jr.) was an American jazz singer, pianist, and composer born on October 28, 1939 in Newark, New Jersey, into a deeply musical family.[2][3] A genuine child prodigy, he began playing piano around age three and was performing in Newark clubs by the time he was eight, chaperoned by relatives.[1][5] As a teenager he appeared at the Apollo Theater and on early television programs like “Spotlight on Harlem” and “The Star Time Kids,” sharing stages with established stars such as Louis Jordan, Sarah Vaughan, and Dinah Washington before he turned 18.[5] In the late 1950s he formed the vocal trio Andy & the Bey Sisters with his sisters Salome Bey and Geraldine Bey de Haas; the group became a sensation in Europe, holding a long residency at the Blue Note in Paris and touring for about sixteen months before returning to the United States to record for RCA and Prestige until disbanding in 1966.[1][5]

After the trio split, Bey spent several years in relative obscurity, working hotel and restaurant gigs while gradually being drawn into the ferment of the late 1960s, including the Civil Rights Movement.[1] At the same time he built a formidable reputation as a sideman, recording with leading edge jazz artists such as Max Roach (Members Don’t Git Weary, 1968), Duke Pearson (How Insensitive, 1969), Gary Bartz’s NTU Troop in the early 1970s, Stanley Clarke (Children of Forever, 1973), Horace Silver on a sequence of Blue Note albums, and organist Lonnie Liston Smith’s Cosmic Echoes.[2][3] In 1974 he made his first solo album for Atlantic, Experience and Judgment, a spiritually oriented, funk–soul-jazz project that blended philosophical lyrics with groove-oriented arrangements, though it attracted limited commercial attention at the time.[1][2] For much of the 1970s and 1980s Bey worked largely under the radar, playing small venues and teaching, including a period coaching singers at the Institute for Jazz in Graz, Austria.[1]

Bey’s major critical breakthrough as a leader came in the mid‑1990s with Ballads, Blues & Bey (1996), a spare voice-and-piano set of standards that revealed the full depth of his baritone and interpretive insight and effectively reintroduced him as a master jazz vocalist after decades of under-recognition.[2][3][4] Subsequent albums such as American Song (Grammy-nominated for Best Jazz Vocal Album in 2005), The World According to Andy Bey (Grammy-nominated, 2013), and Pages from an Imaginary Life (which topped NPR’s 2014 Jazz Critics Poll for Best Vocal Album) cemented his standing at the top rank of jazz singers.[3][4] His vocal style was distinguished by an unusually wide range (often described as spanning four octaves), a dark yet floating baritone timbre, and a hushed, reflective delivery that could make ballads unfold at a “honey-drip” tempo, as if every phrase were a fresh emotional discovery.[2][4] Openly gay and living with HIV, Bey faced his health challenges quietly but resolutely, becoming an admired figure of courage and dignity as well as artistry.[3][4] Over a career spanning more than five decades, he evolved from prodigy and group singer to a singular, introspective voice in vocal jazz, leaving a legacy of emotionally direct, harmonically sophisticated performances that influenced both peers and later generations of jazz vocalists.[2][3][6]

## Fun Facts
- Bey was performing professionally in Newark clubs by age eight and recorded his first single, “Mama’s Little Boy Got the Blues,” for the Jubilee label in 1953 before his voice had even fully changed.[1]
- As a teenager he appeared on early television shows like “Spotlight on Harlem” and “The Star Time Kids,” and shared stages with major stars including Louis Jordan, Sarah Vaughan, and Dinah Washington.[5]
- Andy & the Bey Sisters were called “the world’s most exciting vocal group” by London’s Daily Herald during their late‑1950s European run, at a time when Lambert, Hendricks & Ross were at their peak.[1]
- Bey was widely reported to possess a four‑octave vocal range, pairing that technical command with a quiet, introspective delivery that critics described as making listeners feel he was confiding directly in them.[4]
