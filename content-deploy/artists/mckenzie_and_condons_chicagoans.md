## Biography
McKenzie and Condon's Chicagoans was an American jazz band formed in Chicago in 1927, led by banjoist Eddie Condon and sponsored by singer and comb player Red McKenzie.[1][2] The group brought together some of the most talented young white jazz musicians on the Chicago scene, including Jimmy McPartland on cornet, Frank Teschemacher on clarinet, Bud Freeman on tenor saxophone, Joe Sullivan on piano, Jim Lanigan on bass, Gene Krupa on drums, and Mezz Mezzrow on cymbals.[1][2] Recording for the Okeh label in December 1927, they produced four influential sides: “China Boy,” “Sugar,” “Liza,” and “Nobody’s Sweetheart.”[1][2] These recordings are widely cited as important early documents of the emerging Chicago style of jazz, characterized by a looser, more improvisation‑heavy small‑group approach that built on, but moved beyond, New Orleans ensemble traditions.[1][8]

The Chicagoans’ sound combined hot solo improvisation, a driving rhythmic feel, and tight but relaxed ensemble work, showcasing future jazz luminaries such as Krupa and Freeman at the beginning of their careers.[1][2] Drawing on earlier influences like the New Orleans Rhythm Kings, they helped codify a distinct Chicago idiom: brighter in tone, more soloistic, and often faster and more aggressive than many contemporaneous New Orleans recordings.[8] Although the original group’s recording career was brief, its members went on to major roles in swing and traditional jazz, and the 1927 sides remained touchstones for later revivalists.[1][2] In 1962, several of the surviving musicians reunited to record the album “Chicago and All That Jazz,” with Pee Wee Russell replacing the late Teschemacher on clarinet, Bob Haggart stepping in for Jim Lanigan on bass, and star trombonist Jack Teagarden joining the ensemble, underlining the band’s enduring reputation in classic jazz circles.[1]

Today, McKenzie and Condon’s Chicagoans are remembered less as a long‑running working band than as a seminal recording ensemble whose small discography exerted an outsized influence on traditional and Chicago‑style jazz.[1][2][8] Their Okeh recordings continue to be reissued, studied, and emulated by traditional jazz musicians, preserving their legacy as one of the key bridges between early New Orleans ensembles and the later swing era.[1][2]

## Fun Facts
- The group recorded only four titles in December 1927—"China Boy," "Sugar," "Liza," and "Nobody’s Sweetheart"—yet those few sides became cornerstone documents of early Chicago jazz.[1][2]
- McKenzie and Condon’s Chicagoans was not a long‑standing working band but more a studio ensemble assembled from leading young Chicago players, several of whom (like Gene Krupa and Bud Freeman) later became major swing‑era stars.[1][2]
- Clarinetist Frank Teschemacher, a key voice in the original band, died in 1932 and was replaced by Pee Wee Russell when the group reunited to record the album "Chicago and All That Jazz" in 1962.[1]
- The band’s style was shaped in part by earlier recordings of the New Orleans Rhythm Kings, illustrating how New Orleans jazz concepts were transformed into a distinctly Chicago sound by the late 1920s.[8]
