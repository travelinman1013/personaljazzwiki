## Biography
Leikeli47, born Rhashida Stafford, is an American rapper and producer renowned for her enigmatic persona and genre-blending sound. Raised between Virginia and Brooklyn, New York, she is of partial Trinidadian and Guyanese descent and grew up immersed in the vibrant cultures of both regions. From a young age, Leikeli47 was a shy child with a passion for music, drawing inspiration from artists like Michael Jackson and N.E.R.D. Her upbringing in communities deeply connected to ballroom and vogue culture profoundly shaped her artistic identity, infusing her work with themes of self-acceptance and celebration of difference.

Leikeli47 began her career with a series of mixtapes, starting with 'LK-47' in 2010, followed by 'LK-47 Pt. II' in 2014, and a self-titled EP in 2015. Her breakthrough came with her debut album 'Wash & Set' (2017), which was praised for its inventive lyricism and boundary-pushing sound. She continued to build her legacy with 'Acrylic' (2018), the second part of her 'Beauty Series' trilogy, and 'Shape Up' (2022). Her music fuses hip hop, dancehall, trap, house, punk, and soul, reflecting her multicultural background and the influence of ballroom culture. Notably, until 2024, she was known for concealing her face with a bandana or balaclava during all public appearances, adding to her mystique. In 2024, she publicly revealed her face for the first time in the video for '450,' the lead single from her fourth album.

Leikeli47's legacy is marked by her commitment to uplifting marginalized communities, especially Black women and the LGBTQ+ community. Her work normalizes Black beauty standards and celebrates the safe havens of beauty salons and ballrooms. She is recognized for her hard-hitting yet playful lyricism, genre-defying musicianship, and her role in bringing ballroom and vogue culture into the mainstream hip hop conversation.
