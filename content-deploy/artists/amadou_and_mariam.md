## Biography
Amadou & Mariam were a celebrated musical duo from Bamako, Mali, renowned for blending traditional Malian music with global genres such as blues, rock, Cuban rhythms, and funk. Amadou Bagayoko (1954–2025) and Mariam Doumbia (born 1958) both lost their sight at a young age—Amadou at 15 due to cataracts, and Mariam at 5 from untreated measles. They met in the 1970s at Mali’s Institute for the Young Blind, where they performed together in the Eclipse Orchestra and later became music teachers. Their shared passion for music and advocacy for the blind community led to a lifelong personal and professional partnership, culminating in their marriage in 1980.

The duo began recording together in the late 1970s, initially producing sparse, guitar-and-voice arrangements. Their sound evolved to incorporate a rich mix of influences, including rock guitars, Syrian violins, Cuban trumpets, and Indian tablas, creating a style often described as 'Afro-Funk.' Amadou’s early career included playing with the legendary Les Ambassadeurs du Motel alongside Salif Keita. Amadou & Mariam gained international acclaim in the early 2000s, particularly with their hit 'Dimanche à Bamako' and the Grammy-nominated album 'Welcome to Mali.' They became one of Africa’s most successful musical exports, performing at major global events such as the 2006 FIFA World Cup and Barack Obama’s Nobel Prize concert, and collaborating with artists like Manu Chao, Damon Albarn, and K’Naan.

Their legacy is marked not only by their musical innovation and global reach but also by their tireless advocacy for people with disabilities and their efforts to raise awareness about Mali’s cultural richness. Amadou’s passing in 2025 marked the end of an era, but their influence continues to resonate across continents and generations.
