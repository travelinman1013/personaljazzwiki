## Biography
Kenneth Byles, known as Junior Byles, 'Chubby,' or 'King Chubby,' was born on February 2, 1948, at Jubilee Hospital in Kingston, Jamaica, to a mechanic father and schoolteacher mother, both devout Christians. Growing up in the Jonestown area, he sang in the church choir and admired local artists like Slim Smith, while training as a mechanic after high school and working as a firefighter. In 1967, he formed the vocal trio The Versatiles with Dudley Earl and Ben 'Louis' Davis, auditioning for the Festival Song Contest and catching the eye of producer Lee 'Scratch' Perry, who was scouting for Joe Gibbs' label.[2][1]

Byles transitioned to a solo career after The Versatiles disbanded in 1970, forging a pivotal partnership with Perry that defined his peak in the early 1970s roots reggae scene. Hits like 'Beat Down Babylon,' 'King of Babylon,' 'Place Called Africa,' and the controversial 'Rub Up Festival' (disqualified in 1971) showcased his Rastafarian beliefs and emotional vocals, followed by successes such as 'Festival Da Da' (1972 runner-up), 'Fever,' and the massive 'Fade Away' (1975), produced by JoJo Hookim. He self-produced via his Love Power label, supported Michael Manley's 1972 campaign with 'Joshua Desire' and 'Pharaoh Hiding,' and released albums *Beat Down Babylon* (1972) and *Jordan* (1976), establishing him as a major Jamaican and UK star with a style blending conscious lyrics, rocksteady roots, and dub elements.[2][1]

Mental health struggles intensified after Emperor Haile Selassie's 1975 death, leading to hospitalizations, flops, and withdrawal by 1976. Personal tragedies—his mother's death, home fire, wife's emigration—culminated in homelessness by 1987. Sporadic comebacks included *Rasta No Pickpocket* (1986), recordings with Winston Holness, tours with Earl 'Chinna' Smith (1997-1998), and 2004 performances in Jamaica and the UK. Diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2018, Byles passed away on May 15, 2025, leaving a legacy as a roots reggae pioneer.[2][1]

## Fun Facts
- Entered the 1971 Festival Song Contest with 'Rub Up Festival,' which was disqualified in the finals due to suggestive lyrics despite strong performance.[2]
- Supported Michael Manley's 1972 election with singles 'Joshua Desire' (Joshua for Manley) and 'Pharaoh Hiding' (Pharaoh for opponent Hugh Shearer), later critiquing him in 'When Will Better Come?'[2]
- Recorded under the pseudonym 'King Chubby' for early hit 'What's The World Coming To' with Lee Perry.[2]
- His 1975 discomix 'Fade Away' appeared on the *Rockers* film soundtrack and was a smash hit in Jamaica and the UK.[2]
