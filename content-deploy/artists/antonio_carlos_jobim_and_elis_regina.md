## Biography
Antonio Carlos Jobim, born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, studied piano and harmony in his early years and worked as a pianist in bars and studios, blending classical music influences with samba rhythms to pioneer bossa nova in the late 1950s. Collaborating with poet Vinicius de Moraes on works like the play Orfeu da Conceição and songs such as Chega de Saudade, Jobim created a genre fusing samba's syncopation with jazz harmonies and poetic lyrics, epitomized by global hits like The Girl from Ipanema. Elis Regina, rising as Brazil's most popular singer by the 1970s, brought emotional intensity and spontaneity to MPB and bossa nova, shaped by her performances and recordings amid Brazil's political turbulence[1][3].

In February 1974, Jobim and Regina met in Los Angeles to record the iconic bossa nova album Elis & Tom, capturing their warm rapport on tracks like Aguas de Março, considered one of Brazil's greatest songs. The sessions involved a tight-knit group including Regina's husband Cesar Camargo Mariano on piano, drummer Paulo Braga, bassist Luizao Maia, guitarist Oscar Castro-Neves, and producer Aloysio de Oliveira, evoking communal Brazilian music-making with extended, intimate engagement[1][2][6]. Jobim's style emphasized lush harmonies and poetic lyricism, while Regina's percussive passion contrasted cooler jazz interpretations, preserving bossa nova's roots against American commercialization[1][3].

Their collaboration produced a timeless recording hailed as a landmark for retaining Brazilian nuances, influencing jazz legacies, and showcasing ethnic diversity in music production. Jobim, the father of bossa nova, and Regina left enduring impacts through global popularity and cultural preservation[1][3][6].
