## Biography
Johnny Guarnieri (born John Albert Guarnieri on March 23, 1917, in New York City; died January 7, 1985) was an American jazz and stride pianist whose career spanned the swing era into the early 1980s.[1][7] A descendant of the famous Guarnerius family of violin makers, he was expected to pursue strings, but instead took up piano around age ten and received solid classical training before turning decisively to jazz as a teenager.[1][3][4] By his mid-teens he was already impressing major figures such as James P. Johnson with his stride playing, and not long after graduating from Roosevelt High School he began working professionally, first with George Hall’s band in 1937 and then in small groups around New York.[1][4]

Guarnieri’s national profile rose rapidly at the end of the 1930s. In December 1939 he successfully auditioned for Benny Goodman’s orchestra, recording prolifically with both Goodman’s big band and sextet, and in 1940 he joined Artie Shaw’s orchestra and the famed Gramercy Five, where his harpsichord solos became some of the first recorded examples of jazz on that instrument.[1][4] Through the early 1940s he worked with leading swing ensembles including those of Artie Shaw, Tommy Dorsey, and others, while also recording extensively as a sideman with Lester Young, Roy Eldridge, Ben Webster, Coleman Hawkins, Don Byas, Louis Armstrong, and many more, and leading his own groups such as the Johnny Guarnieri Swing Men and a trio with Slam Stewart and Sammy Weiss.[1][6] From the mid‑1940s he combined club work on New York’s West 52nd Street with radio studio jobs and even his own short radio programs, later moving to Los Angeles in the 1960s, where he focused on solo piano, television work, and long residencies such as his decade‑plus engagement at the Tail of the Cock in Studio City.[1][3][4]

Stylistically, Guarnieri was renowned as a virtuosic stride pianist who could closely evoke Fats Waller, Count Basie, and Art Tatum while retaining his own voice, and he frequently blended jazz and classical materials, embellishing standards with Scarlatti‑ or Beethoven‑like flourishes.[1][3][4] Critics and colleagues regarded him as one of the outstanding pianists of the swing era, prized for his time, touch, and dazzling technique as both accompanist and soloist, and he became one of the most frequently recorded pianists of the 1940s.[1][2][6] In later years he emphasized education and mentoring while continuing to tour, including several European trips in the 1970s, and by the time of his death in 1985 he had compiled a forty‑plus‑year discography and a reputation among musicians as one of the great, if under‑recognized, masters of swing and stride piano.[1][2][4][5]

## Fun Facts
- Guarnieri came from the same extended family as the famed Guarnerius violin makers, yet defied expectations by choosing piano over the violin.[1][4]
- As a teenager, after impressing James P. Johnson with his stride playing, he was jokingly ranked by Johnson as “number three” in the stride hierarchy—after Johnson himself and his prize pupil Fats Waller—effectively placing Guarnieri in a direct stylistic lineage.[4][5]
- His harpsichord solos with Artie Shaw’s Gramercy Five are widely noted as among the first recorded examples of jazz played on the harpsichord.[1][4]
- From the late 1960s into the early 1980s he held a long-running residency at the Tail of the Cock nightclub in Studio City, California, where he played six nights a week and drew a regular crowd of Hollywood and music-industry figures while still taking time off for special tours and recordings.[1][4]

## Musical Connections

### Mentors/Influences
- [[james_p._johnson|James P. Johnson]] - Early stride piano exemplar who heard Guarnieri as a teenager, evaluated his playing, and effectively inducted him into the stride piano lineage. (Informal encounters rather than specific recorded collaborations; Johnson’s stride style (and his pupil Fats Waller) shaped Guarnieri’s approach.) [Mid-1930s (Guarnieri’s mid-teens) [4][5]]
- [[fats_waller|Fats Waller]] - Major stylistic influence; Guarnieri modeled his early stride style on Waller and was later praised for his ability to imitate Waller’s feel and humor at the piano. (No direct recorded projects together; influence heard across Guarnieri’s stride performances and recordings, especially solo and small‑group sides of the 1940s.) [Influence beginning in Guarnieri’s teens and continuing throughout his career [1][3][5]]
- [[art_tatum|Art Tatum]] - Guarnieri was noted for being able to closely imitate Tatum’s virtuosic style, indicating deep study and influence from Tatum’s harmonic and technical innovations. (No documented joint recordings; influence reflected in Guarnieri’s advanced harmony and rapid, ornate runs in solo performances.) [Primarily the 1940s–1950s, as Guarnieri’s reputation as a piano virtuoso developed [1]]
- [[count_basie|Count Basie]] - Another pianist whose style Guarnieri could convincingly emulate, suggesting Basie’s economical swing and comping strongly informed his big‑band work. (Imitative aspects heard particularly in his work with big bands such as Benny Goodman and Artie Shaw.) [Late 1930s–1940s, during Guarnieri’s big‑band heyday [1]]

### Key Collaborators
- [[benny_goodman|Benny Goodman]] - Guarnieri served as pianist in Goodman’s big band and sextet, making numerous recordings and broadcasts and helping shape the sound of late‑1930s and early‑1940s swing. (Multiple sides with Benny Goodman Orchestra and Sextet after his December 1939 audition (various Columbia/RCA/Victor releases).) [1939–1941 (two main stints) [1][2][4]]
- [[artie_shaw|Artie Shaw]] - Pianist in Shaw’s big band and member of the Gramercy Five; his harpsichord solos on Gramercy Five recordings are among the first jazz harpsichord on record. (Artie Shaw and His Gramercy Five recordings (including celebrated small‑group sides where Guarnieri plays harpsichord).) [Circa 1940–1942 (including returns after brief breaks) [1][4]]
- [[tommy_dorsey|Tommy Dorsey]] - Worked as pianist in Dorsey’s orchestra during the heart of the swing era, further solidifying his big‑band credentials. (Various Tommy Dorsey Orchestra recordings and broadcasts during his tenure.) [1942–1943 [1][4]]
- [[lester_young|Lester Young]] - Recorded both as a sideman for Young and as a leader with Young in his own band; their collaborations are often cited as important swing documents. (Recordings such as “Sometimes I’m Happy” and sessions where Young appears as a sideman with the Johnny Guarnieri Swing Men.) [Mid‑1940s (especially 1944–1947) [1][6]]
- [[slam_stewart|Slam Stewart]] - Bassist in Guarnieri’s trio and other small‑group contexts; their interplay became a signature aspect of his small‑group recordings. (Johnny Guarnieri Trio recordings for Savoy; later sessions such as the 1975 Paris recordings featuring Guarnieri and Stewart.) [1940s (Savoy trio) and reunion sessions in the 1970s [1]]
- [[june_christy|June Christy]] - Vocalist fronting a small group led by Guarnieri; he served as both accompanist and bandleader on an early post‑war vocal jazz project. (Album "June Christy & The Johnny Guarnieri Quintet" (recorded 1949).) [1949 [1]]
- [[louis_armstrong|Louis Armstrong]] - Guarnieri appeared as pianist on at least one documented Armstrong session, demonstrating his status among top swing musicians. (Recording of “Jack-Armstrong Blues.”) [1940s (exact session dates in mid‑1940s) [1]]
- [[coleman_hawkins_ben_webster_don_byas_roy_eldridge_rex_stewart_hot_lips_page_bobby_hackett_ike_quebec_cozy_cole_hank_damico_charlie_christian|Coleman Hawkins, Ben Webster, Don Byas, Roy Eldridge, Rex Stewart, Hot Lips Page, Bobby Hackett, Ike Quebec, Cozy Cole, Hank D’Amico, Charlie Christian]] - Frequent session work as a highly sought-after pianist, accompanying leading horn players and rhythm-section peers across the swing and early bop eras. (Numerous 1940s small‑group recordings on labels such as Savoy and Majestic, including sessions under both his own and others’ names.) [Primarily early–mid 1940s [1][6]]

### Artists Influenced
- [[later_stride_and_swing_pianists_general|Later stride and swing pianists (general)]] - Guarnieri’s acknowledged status as a leading post‑Waller stride pianist, his long residency work in Los Angeles, and his later focus on jazz education are cited as having shaped subsequent generations, though specific named pupils are not consistently documented in accessible sources. (His many solo stride recordings and educational activities in the 1970s–1980s, including performances at Tail of the Cock and releases on his Taz Jazz label, served as models for later traditional jazz pianists.) [1960s–1980s [1][2][4]]
