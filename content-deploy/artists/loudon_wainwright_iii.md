## Biography
Loudon Snowden Wainwright III, born September 5, 1946, in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, is a celebrated American folk singer-songwriter and occasional actor. Raised in a literary family—his father was a columnist for Life magazine—Wainwright began playing guitar during his boarding school years and started writing songs in his early twenties after a stint working odd jobs in New York and Rhode Island. He was discovered by manager Milton Kramer and signed to Atlantic Records, releasing his self-titled debut album in 1970. His breakthrough came in 1972 with the quirky hit 'Dead Skunk (in the Middle of the Road),' which reached the Top 20 and established his reputation for witty, self-deprecating, and emotionally candid songwriting.

Wainwright's career has spanned over five decades, marked by more than 25 albums and a distinctive style blending humor, irony, and personal narrative. Critics have often compared his literate, confessional approach to that of Bob Dylan, though Wainwright’s work is noted for its unique blend of tragi-comedy and sharp observation. He has received multiple Grammy nominations, winning Best Traditional Folk Album in 2010 for 'High Wide & Handsome: The Charlie Poole Project.' Beyond music, Wainwright is known for his acting, notably as Captain Calvin Spalding, the 'singing surgeon,' on the TV series M*A*S*H, and for roles in films such as 'The Aviator' and 'Knocked Up.'

Wainwright’s influence extends through his family—his children Rufus Wainwright, Martha Wainwright, and Lucy Wainwright Roche are all acclaimed musicians—and through his collaborations and songwriting, which have inspired and been covered by artists across genres. His legacy is that of a pioneering singer-songwriter whose honest, often humorous reflections on family, love, and life have left a lasting mark on American folk music.
