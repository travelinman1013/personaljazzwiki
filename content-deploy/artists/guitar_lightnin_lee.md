Guitar Lightnin' Lee is a rhythm and blues musician who grew up in the Lower Ninth Ward of New Orleans, Louisiana, a neighborhood steeped in musical tradition[3]. Born over 60 years ago, Lee was surrounded by music from an early age, absorbing the sounds of the city’s vibrant blues scene[3]. He received direct mentorship from New Orleans blues legend Boogie Bill Webb, which helped shape his deep-rooted blues style[3]. Over the years, Lee developed a reputation as a purist, dedicated to preserving the raw, soulful essence of rhythm and blues[1][2]. His career is marked by a commitment to authenticity, often performing with a band of veteran rock and blues musicians, sometimes much younger than himself, creating a dynamic contrast on stage[2][4].

His legacy lies in his role as a torchbearer for New Orleans blues, keeping the tradition alive for new generations.
