## Biography
The McCoy Tyner Trio is led by Alfred McCoy Tyner, a pioneering jazz pianist born in 1938 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Tyner grew up in a musically vibrant environment, taking formal piano lessons at the Granoff School of Music and drawing inspiration from neighbors like Bud Powell and Thelonious Monk. By his late teens, Tyner was already leading his own group and performing in local Philadelphia clubs, where he met many future jazz greats.

Tyner’s career took off in the early 1960s when he joined John Coltrane’s Classic Quartet, contributing to seminal albums such as 'A Love Supreme' and 'My Favorite Things.' After leaving Coltrane’s group in 1965, Tyner established himself as a bandleader, recording prolifically and forming several ensembles, including his celebrated trio. The McCoy Tyner Trio became known for its powerful, percussive piano style, rich harmonic language, and incorporation of African and spiritual musical elements. Tyner’s influence on jazz piano is profound, with his innovative chord voicings and modal approach shaping the sound of modern jazz. Over his career, he recorded more than eighty albums, won five Grammy Awards, and was named an NEA Jazz Master. Tyner remained active as a performer and composer until his passing in 2020, leaving a legacy as one of jazz’s most influential pianists.
