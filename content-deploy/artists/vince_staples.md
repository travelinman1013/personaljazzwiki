## Biography
Vincent Jamal Staples was born on July 2, 1993, in Compton, California, and grew up in North Long Beach after his mother relocated the family to escape high crime rates.[1][2] As the youngest of five to six siblings in a working-class household, Staples spent formative years with his maternal grandfather, Andrew Hutchins, a retired truck driver and construction worker who profoundly influenced his worldview. His early adolescence was marked by involvement with street gangs, particularly the Crips, which shaped much of his later artistic perspective. Staples attended Optimal Christian Academy from 4th to 8th grade, an experience he has described as transformative, before attending multiple high schools including Jordan High School in Long Beach and Mayfair High School in Lakewood.[1][2] A pivotal moment came when his grandfather died in 2005, an event Staples has cited as instrumental in his personal development.

Staples' entry into music was serendipitous rather than intentional. Discovered by manager Dijon "LaVish" Samo and Chuck Wun, he was introduced to members of the Odd Future collective—including Syd tha Kyd, Mike G, and Earl Sweatshirt—during a trip to Los Angeles.[1][2] Though he initially had no aspirations toward rap, Staples began making guest appearances on Odd Future projects, most notably on Earl Sweatshirt's 2010 mixtape *Earl*.[1][2] His breakthrough came through the collaborative mixtape *Stolen Youth* with producer Mac Miller, which led to a Def Jam record deal. After three years of development, Staples released his debut EP *Hell Can Wait* in October 2014, followed by his critically acclaimed debut album *Summertime '06* in June 2015.[4] The album's title references the era when Staples was approaching thirteen and becoming deeply involved in gang culture, transforming specific Ramona Park addresses into lyrical landmarks while exploring his family's struggles and Long Beach's socioeconomic realities.

Staples' artistic evolution reflects a deliberate shift from his early detached monotone delivery toward a more emotionally vulnerable and indignant vocal style, establishing him as West Coast hip-hop's introspective chronicler of urban life.[3] His work is characterized by unflinching examinations of systemic inequality, personal trauma, and the complexities of Black identity in America. Beyond music, Staples has pursued acting and comedy, appearing in films including *Black Panther* (2018) and *Creed* (2015).[8] He remains a member of the hip-hop trio Cutthroat Boyz alongside Aston Matthews and Joey Fatts, while maintaining an independent artistic vision that resists commercial compromise.[4]

## Fun Facts
- Staples played football in Snoop Dogg's Snoop Youth Football League (SYFL) as a child, where he received personalized jerseys, high-quality cleats, and helmets—an experience he credits to Snoop's genuine passion for supporting youth athletics.
- His maternal grandfather moved to Compton after seeing an interview with Brooklyn Dodgers player Duke Snider, who mentioned living there; the grandfather became a lifelong Dodgers fan and this family connection influenced Staples' deep roots in the Compton/Long Beach area.
- Staples' mother paid only $200-300 per month to attend Optimal Christian Academy through an arrangement with his aunt, who owned a house with two back units; despite its modest cost, Staples has called it 'the best school I've ever been to in my life.'
- The majority of Staples' family are Haitian immigrants who initially settled in Eastern Canada before moving to Louisiana, then eventually to California—a diaspora journey that informs his understanding of displacement and systemic inequality.
