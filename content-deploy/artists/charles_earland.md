## Biography
Charles Earland (May 24, 1941 – December 11, 1999) was an influential American jazz organist renowned for his mastery of the Hammond B-3 and his dynamic presence in the soul-jazz, jazz funk, and hard bop scenes. Born in Philadelphia, a city known for its rich jazz tradition, Earland began his musical journey on his father's alto saxophone and played baritone sax in high school alongside future jazz luminaries like Pat Martino and Lew Tabackin. After a stint with the Temple University band, he toured as a tenor saxophonist with Jimmy McGriff, whose organ playing inspired Earland to switch instruments. He taught himself the Hammond B-3 during breaks on tour, and after leaving McGriff, formed his own trio with Martino and drummer Bobby Durham.

Earland's career took off in the late 1960s when he joined Lou Donaldson's group, recording two albums for Blue Note before launching his solo career with Prestige Records. His debut album for Prestige, 'Black Talk!' (1969), became a soul-jazz classic, propelled by his energetic groove and a hit cover of 'More Today Than Yesterday.' Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Earland continued to evolve, incorporating synthesizers and funk elements, and collaborating with his wife, singer Sheryl Kendrick. Despite personal setbacks, including Kendrick's death in 1985, Earland remained a vital force in jazz, recording for labels like Muse, Mercury, and Columbia, and mentoring younger musicians. He was affectionately nicknamed 'The Mighty Burner' for his powerful, soulful playing and exceptional bass pedal technique.

Earland's legacy endures through his extensive discography, his role in popularizing the jazz organ, and his influence on subsequent generations of jazz, funk, and acid jazz musicians. He died of heart failure in Kansas City in 1999, the morning after a performance, leaving behind a body of work that continues to inspire and energize listeners.
