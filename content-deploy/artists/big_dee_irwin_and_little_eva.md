## Biography
Big Dee Irwin & Little Eva were paired most famously on the 1963 hit duet version of “Swinging on a Star,” a swinging pop-soul remake of the 1944 Bing Crosby song that blended Irwin’s smooth R&B baritone with Little Eva’s bright, youthful voice.[1][2][3] Their recording, issued on Dimension Records, reached No. 38 on the US pop chart and became a substantially bigger success in the UK, where it climbed to No. 7 and helped establish their footing with British audiences during the height of the early‑’60s pop boom.[1][2] The UK success led to an extended nine‑month British tour and, later, further joint releases, including a Pye Records EP and a 1973 album titled “Swinging On A Star” that kept their duet work in circulation for the UK market.[1][3]

Behind the duet billing were two distinct American R&B-pop artists. Big Dee Irwin (born DiFosco “Dee” T. Ervin Jr. on July 6, 1932, in Harlem, New York) first came up as lead singer of the United States Air Force vocal group The Pastels in the mid‑1950s, then moved into a solo career on Hull, Bliss, and finally Dimension Records, where the “Swinging on a Star” duet with Little Eva became his signature hit.[1][2] Little Eva (born Eva Narcissus Boyd on June 29, 1943, in Belhaven, North Carolina) had broken through a year earlier with the Gerry Goffin–Carole King dance smash “The Loco‑Motion” and was a labelmate of Irwin; she provided co‑lead vocals on “Swinging on a Star” (uncredited on the original US single) and again on the follow‑up “Happy Being Fat,” cementing the pair’s association in early‑’60s pop-soul and later on the UK touring circuit.[3][4][6]

Although they never functioned as a permanent group in the strict sense, Big Dee Irwin & Little Eva occupy a small but distinctive niche in early‑1960s R&B and Brill Building–era pop. Their records combined Brill Building songcraft and pop arrangements with elements of New York R&B and the emerging sound that would later feed into Northern Soul collectors’ tastes, particularly among UK fans who embraced their singles and reissues.[1][2][3] The continued re‑release of their material—such as the UK compilation “Another Night with Big Dee Irwin” and the Pye “Swinging On A Star” issue—helped preserve their reputation among soul and early‑rock aficionados, and their duet work remains a touchstone of the cross‑Atlantic exchange that shaped 1960s pop.[1][2][3]

## Fun Facts
- Little Eva’s vocals on Big Dee Irwin’s hit “Swinging on a Star” were uncredited on the original single, even though she shares the lead throughout the record.[1][2][3]
- “Swinging on a Star” became a much bigger hit in the UK (No. 7) than in the United States (No. 38), which led to a nine‑month British tour for Big Dee Irwin and helped cement the duo’s popularity with UK audiences.[1][2]
- Following their UK success, Pye Records packaged Big Dee Irwin and Little Eva together on a joint EP and later a 1973 album, both titled “Swinging On A Star,” effectively branding them as a duet act for British listeners.[3]
- Before they were paired on record, Little Eva had already been part of the Brill Building scene as a babysitter and maid for Carole King and Gerry Goffin, who wrote her breakout hit “The Loco‑Motion.”[4][5]
