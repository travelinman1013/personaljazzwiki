## Biography
Born Elmer Lee Fields in Wilson, North Carolina, in 1950 or 1951 to Emma Jean Fields and John Fields, Lee Fields grew up in a home where his parents ran a speakeasy on Saturday nights and took him to church on Sundays, fostering his early exposure to music.[1][4][5] As a teenager, he moved to New York City in 1967, deeply inspired by James Brown's performance in The T.A.M.I. Show, which propelled him to pursue a career as a soul star; he released his debut single 'Bewildered' in 1969, produced by Kip Anderson on Bedford Records.[1][3][4] The 1970s saw him build a reputation as a funk king with classics like 1973's 'Let's Talk It Over' and 'She's a Lovemaker,' backed by Sammy Gordon and the Hip Huggers, though shifting tastes and missed opportunities kept him from mainstream fame, leading to independent releases and southern blues circuit touring.[1][2][4]

In the 1980s and early 1990s, Fields experimented with electronic music and blues, even producing records on his own BDA label, but his career revived in 1996 with Desco Records, co-run by Gabriel Roth and Phillip Lehman, starting with 'Let a Man Do What He Wana Do' and the 1998 album Let's Get a Groove On, positioning him as a torchbearer for the funk revival alongside labelmates like Sharon Jones.[1][3][4][5] Desco evolved into Daptone Records, where he became a key figure in the early 2000s soul revival with artists like Charles Bradley; he formed his backing band The Expressions, releasing multiple albums and touring globally to festivals like Coachella and Carnegie Hall.[1][3] His style blends raw funk, deep soul, and retro influences, earning praise for his powerful voice likened to James Brown, often called 'Little JB.'[1][6][8]

Fields' five-decades-plus career includes over 20 albums and 40 singles, with samples by hip-hop artists like J. Cole and A$AP Rocky, and a 2005 detour into dance music via Martin Solveig's 'Jealousy.'[1][3][4] Now based in Plainfield, New Jersey, with his wife Christine since 1969, he continues as a prolific force in modern soul via Big Crown Records, maintaining fiery live performances.[1][4]
