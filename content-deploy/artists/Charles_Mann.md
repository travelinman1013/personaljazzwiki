## Biography
Charles Mann, born Charles Louis Domingue on November 22, 1944, in Welsh, Louisiana, is a cornerstone figure in the swamp pop genre. As a youngster, he developed his love for singing by listening to the radio and later joined the church choir. At sixteen, he joined his first band, Ricky and the Hound Dogs, performing rock & roll and South Louisiana music that would later be known as swamp pop. Four years later, he joined another group, The Eltradoors, from Gueydan, Louisiana, which helped establish his musical foundation.

Mann's recording career began in 1965 when he released his first single "Keep Your Arms Around Me" under the stage name Charles Mann, which became a huge regional hit. His biggest commercial success came in 1969 with his version of Neil Diamond's "Red Red Wine," which became his signature song and opened many doors for his career. He also achieved international success with his Cajun-oriented swamp pop version of Dire Straits' "Walk of Life," which led to a record deal with UK-based Cooking Vinyl in 1989 and touring throughout the United Kingdom, including an appearance at Glastonbury Festival.

Throughout his career spanning over five decades since 1965, Mann has recorded six albums and more than 14 singles, establishing himself as a master of the swamp pop style that blends Cajun, country, and R&B influences. His contributions to Louisiana swamp pop music were recognized when he became a member of the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame in 1990. At 81 years old, Mann continues to record and perform, maintaining his status as one of the pioneering figures of swamp pop music.

## Fun Facts
- Mann's hit 'Keep Your Arms Around Me' was judged successful not only by record sales and radio play, but by how many jukeboxes the record was spinning on - a unique measure of popularity in that era.
- His version of Dire Straits' 'Walk of Life' became so popular in the UK that it led to a record deal with Cooking Vinyl and extensive touring throughout Britain, including a performance at the prestigious Glastonbury Festival.
- Mann recorded his debut song 'Pushing Your Luck' in 1964 with the rock 'n' rollers the Eltradors, and later re-recorded it with Cajun seasoning featuring accordion by Timmy Broussard.
- He should not be confused with the soul singer-songwriter Charles Mann (1949-1991) who worked in the Philadelphia Sound world during the 1970s.
