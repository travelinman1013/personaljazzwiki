## Biography
Clarence "Gatemouth" Brown was born on April 18, 1924, in Vinton, Louisiana, and raised in Orange, Texas. His father, a multi-instrumentalist and local musician, taught him to play the fiddle, guitar, and piano, immersing him early in the diverse musical traditions of the Texas-Louisiana border, including country, Cajun, bluegrass, polka, and swing. By age five, Brown was playing the fiddle, and by his teens, he was performing drums in swing bands, earning the nickname "Gatemouth" for his deep, resonant voice.

Brown's professional breakthrough came in 1947 during a T-Bone Walker concert at Houston's Bronze Peacock nightclub. When Walker fell ill mid-performance, Brown seized the moment, taking the stage and electrifying the crowd with his own tune, "Gatemouth Boogie." This impromptu performance led to a recording contract and the launch of his recording career. Brown's early singles, including "Mary is Fine," charted successfully, and he became the frontman for a 23-piece orchestra touring the South. Over his career, Brown recorded more than 30 albums and was renowned for his genre-defying style, blending blues, jazz, country, zydeco, Cajun, and even calypso into what he called "American and World Music -- Texas Style." A multi-instrumentalist, he played guitar, fiddle, harmonica, piano, mandolin, viola, and drums with equal skill.

Brown's influence and legacy are profound. He won a Grammy Award for Best Traditional Blues Album in 1983 for "Alright Again!" and was inducted into the Blues Foundation Hall of Fame in 1999. He toured internationally, performed frequently at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, and inspired generations of musicians with his eclecticism and virtuosity. Brown passed away in 2005 in Orange, Texas, after being displaced by Hurricane Katrina, leaving behind a rich legacy as one of American music's most versatile and innovative figures.
