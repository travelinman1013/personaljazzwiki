## Biography
Terri Gibbs (born June 15, 1954) is an American country music artist who was born blind in Miami, Florida, and raised from age one in Augusta, Georgia. Despite her blindness from birth, her parents ensured she was treated no differently from sighted peers, enrolling her in public school where she graduated from Butler High School in 1972. Gibbs demonstrated exceptional musical talent from an early age, learning piano at just three years old and possessing perfect pitch—the ability to hear a tune once and play it back perfectly. Her early performances in the Augusta area caught the attention of legendary guitarist Chet Atkins, who advised her to pursue a country music career in Nashville at age eighteen.[1][3]

Gibbs' breakthrough came in 1980 when she signed with MCA Records after sending a demo tape to producer Ed Penney. Her debut single, "Somebody's Knockin'" (1980), became a crossover phenomenon, reaching No. 8 on the country charts, No. 13 on the Billboard Hot 100, and No. 3 on the Adult Contemporary charts.[1][2] The song's success earned her the Academy of Country Music's Top New Female Vocalist award in 1981 and made her the first-ever winner of the Country Music Association's Horizon Award, recognizing emerging artists. She received Grammy nominations for Best Country Song and Best Female Country Vocal Performance for the track. Between 1980 and 2017, Gibbs recorded eleven studio albums across multiple labels, charting 13 singles on the Billboard country charts.[1]

After achieving initial success with follow-up hits like "Rich Man" (No. 19) and "Ashes to Ashes" (Top 20), Gibbs' commercial momentum slowed in the mid-1980s. She later shifted her focus to Contemporary Christian music, recording albums including "Turn Around" (1987), which earned her a second Grammy nomination, and "Comfort the People" (1988).[1][2] Gibbs performed on prestigious platforms including the Grand Ole Opry, Madison Square Garden, and television programs such as American Bandstand, The Merv Griffin Show, and Good Morning America. She toured extensively with country legends George Jones and Tammy Wynette, and performed internationally in London and for troops in Germany.[3] Though she stepped back from music to focus on family, her pioneering career as a blind female country artist in the early 1980s remains significant in country music history.
