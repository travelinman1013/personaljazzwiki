## Biography
Bonerama is a pioneering brass funk rock band hailing from New Orleans, Louisiana, formed in 1998 by trombonists Mark Mullins and Craig Klein. Both founders were longtime members of Harry Connick Jr.'s big band before launching Bonerama as a creative outlet to push the boundaries of the traditional brass band sound. The group quickly grew to include other talented trombonists, a sousaphone, guitar, and drums, establishing a bold lineup that placed trombones front and center—an unusual move that became their signature.

Bonerama's musical style is a vibrant fusion of rock, funk, jazz, blues, gospel, and soul, reflecting the rich musical heritage of New Orleans. Their energetic performances and genre-defying approach have earned them acclaim for both original compositions and inventive covers of artists such as Led Zeppelin, The Beatles, and Black Sabbath. Over the years, Bonerama has released several albums, including 'Live at the Old Point' (2001), 'Shake It Baby' (2013), and 'Bonerama Plays Zeppelin' (2019), and has played prestigious venues and festivals worldwide. Their collaborations with artists like OK Go, R.E.M., and Little Feat showcase their versatility and influence across genres.

Now in their third decade, Bonerama is celebrated as one of New Orleans’ most respected and beloved bands, credited with redefining the brass band format and inspiring a new generation of musicians. Their legacy is marked by their innovative sound, high-energy shows, and deep connection to the cultural DNA of New Orleans.
