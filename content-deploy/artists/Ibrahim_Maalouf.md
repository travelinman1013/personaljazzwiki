## Biography
Ibrahim Maalouf, born in Beirut, Lebanon, in 1980, is a French-Lebanese trumpeter, composer, arranger, and producer celebrated for his innovative fusion of jazz, Arabic music, classical, and contemporary genres. Raised in a family of musicians—his father, Nassim Maalouf, is a renowned trumpeter and his mother a pianist—Maalouf began trumpet lessons at age seven under his father's guidance. The family relocated to Paris during the Lebanese Civil War, where Ibrahim's musical education flourished, including studies at the Conservatoire de Paris. He was influenced early by both Western classical and Middle Eastern musical traditions, notably learning to play the quarter-tone trumpet, which allows for the nuanced scales of Arabic music.

Maalouf's career is marked by a series of international trumpet competition victories and collaborations with a diverse array of artists, including Sting, Quincy Jones, Angélique Kidjo, Vanessa Paradis, and Salif Keita. His debut solo album, 'Diasporas,' was released in 2007, and he has since produced over a dozen acclaimed albums, such as 'Diagnostic' (2011), 'Illusions' (2013), and 'Red & Black Light' (2015). Maalouf's music is recognized for its intricate blend of improvisational jazz, Arabic melodies, and classical structures, often performed on his signature four-valve trumpet. His global appeal has led him to perform at prestigious venues worldwide, and in 2022, he became the first Lebanese instrumentalist nominated for a Grammy Award for his collaboration with Angélique Kidjo on 'Queen of Sheba.'

Maalouf's legacy lies in his role as a cultural bridge, using music to foster dialogue between Arab and Western worlds. He has been honored as a UNESCO Young Artist for Intercultural Dialogue and remains a leading figure in contemporary jazz and world music, inspiring a new generation of musicians with his cross-genre experimentation and technical mastery.
