## Biography
Lightnin' Hopkins, born Samuel John Hopkins on March 15, 1912, in Centerville, Texas, emerged from a background of poverty and hardship as the son of sharecroppers and the grandson of slaves. After his father's early death, Hopkins and his family moved to Leona, Texas, where he built his first guitar from a cigar box and chicken-wire strings. By age ten, he was already playing with his cousin, bluesman Texas Alexander, and the legendary Blind Lemon Jefferson, who became a formative influence on his style. Hopkins spent his youth working in the fields, playing at local gatherings, and occasionally running afoul of the law, including a stint in Houston County Prison Farm in the 1930s.

Hopkins' professional breakthrough came in 1946, when talent scout Lola Anne Cullum discovered him performing in Houston's Third Ward. She arranged for him to record with Aladdin Records in Los Angeles, pairing him with pianist Wilson "Thunder" Smith. This collaboration led to his nickname "Lightnin'" and launched a prolific recording career that spanned more than three decades and hundreds of tracks. Hopkins was known for his nimble guitar work, improvisational lyricism, and ability to bridge rural country blues and postwar electric blues, making him a beloved figure in both acoustic and electric traditions.

Throughout his sixty-year career, Lightnin' Hopkins maintained a distinctive Texas blues sound, characterized by syncopated fingerpicking, conversational vocals, and a deeply personal storytelling style. His influence extended well beyond the blues, shaping the work of countless musicians in blues, rock, and folk. Hopkins was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1980 and remains celebrated as one of the most prolific and admired blues artists of the 20th century.
