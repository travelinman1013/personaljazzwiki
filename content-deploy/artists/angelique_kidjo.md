## Biography
Angélique Kidjo, born July 14, 1960, in Ouidah, Dahomey (now Benin), is a globally celebrated Beninese-French singer-songwriter, activist, and five-time Grammy Award winner. Raised in a family of artists—her father a musician and her mother a choreographer—Kidjo began performing at age six in her mother's theatre troupe and later sang with her brothers in a rock-R&B band. By her early twenties, she was already a professional singer, recording her first album, 'Pretty,' in 1988, after moving to Paris in 1983 to escape political unrest in Benin. There, she immersed herself in the vibrant Parisian music scene, studying jazz and collaborating with musicians such as Jean Hébrail (her future husband) and Jasper van ’t Hof in the jazz group Pili-Pili.

Kidjo's international breakthrough came in 1991 with a deal from Island Records, launching a career defined by her adventurous fusion of traditional African music with global genres including soul, jazz, reggae, funk, and pop. Her albums—such as 'Oremi,' 'Black Ivory Soul,' 'Oyaya!,' and the Grammy-winning 'Eve'—explore the African diaspora and celebrate African women's resilience, often featuring collaborations with artists and choirs from across the continent. Renowned for her dynamic stage presence and multilingual performances (she sings in Fon, French, Yoruba, Gen, English, and more), Kidjo has become a prominent ambassador for African music and culture, as well as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador and activist for women's rights and education.

Her legacy is marked by her role as a bridge between African traditions and the global music scene, earning her comparisons to Miriam Makeba as 'Mama Africa.' Kidjo's influence extends beyond music to humanitarian work, including founding the Batonga Foundation to support girls' education in Africa. She remains a festival favorite and a symbol of Afro-futurism, celebrated for her ability to unite audiences worldwide through her artistry and advocacy.
