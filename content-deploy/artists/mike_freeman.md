## Biography
Mike Freeman is an American jazz vibraphonist, composer, and bandleader born in Omaha, Nebraska in 1959. He began his musical journey at a young age, learning drums at six and playing professionally by thirteen. His early exposure to jazz came through listening to legendary drummers like Buddy Rich and Max Roach, and by age twelve, he had taken up the vibraphone. At fifteen, Freeman was already performing as a percussionist with the Omaha Symphony Orchestra, and during high school, he traveled to Chicago to study with renowned percussionist Bobby Christian. He graduated from DePaul University in 1981 with high honors in music composition, later moving to New York City, where he furthered his studies with composer Hale Rood and immersed himself in the vibrant jazz scene.[1][5]

Freeman's career is distinguished by his spirited, soulful swing rooted in Afro-Cuban rhythms, creating a unique blend of mambo and salsa-inspired jazz-Latin-blues. He has performed extensively across North America, Europe, the Caribbean, and South America, gaining international recognition for his original compositions and recordings. Freeman is the leader of ZonaVibe and has released eight albums as a bandleader, with seventy original compositions that have charted on jazz, contemporary jazz, and world music radio. His works have aired on nationally syndicated programs and received critical acclaim.[2][3][4]

A dedicated arts advocate, Freeman has produced numerous concert series and benefit events, notably for musicians affected by natural disasters. He is a multi-time recipient of the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council Creative Engagement grant, producing projects such as Hell's Kitchen Soul Sauce and Boricua Blues. Freeman has also contributed to music education, writing commissioned works for the Chicago Symphony Orchestra's Percussion Scholarship Program and for China's national percussion curriculum, performed at the Shanghai Symphony Hall. His legacy is marked by his innovative approach to jazz vibraphone and his influential role in Latin jazz.[1][4][5]
