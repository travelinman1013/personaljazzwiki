## Biography
Based on available evidence, there does not appear to be a documented musical artist who records under the exact name “Universal Friend.” Existing search results instead refer to (1) the historical religious figure **The Public Universal Friend** (born Jemima Wilkinson, 1752–1819), an 18th‑century American evangelist, and (2) a contemporary **Indianapolis-based rock band called Public Universal Friend (PUF)** led by musician Jody Galadriel Friend; neither uses the exact artist name “Universal Friend.”[1][3][7] Because no credible music databases, press features, or official pages can be found for a musical act titled precisely “Universal Friend,” it is likely that the Spotify entry you are seeing is either an empty or misattributed profile, or an incomplete listing for the band Public Universal Friend.

The historical Public Universal Friend was born Jemima Wilkinson in Cumberland, Rhode Island, into a Quaker family, and after a severe illness in 1776 claimed to have died and been reborn as a genderless evangelist, thereafter rejecting their birth name and conventional gendered pronouns.[1][2][4] They traveled widely in the northeastern United States preaching repentance and preparation for the Day of Judgment, attracting followers who formed the Society of Universal Friends and eventually founding a settlement called Jerusalem in what is now New York State.[1][2] In parallel, the modern band Public Universal Friend, active out of Indianapolis, is described as an art‑rock/indie‑rock group combining elements of Appalachian folk, 1990s‑inspired indie rock, post‑punk, and goth Americana, fronted by trans/queer bandleader Jody Galadriel Friend; the band explicitly takes its name and some thematic inspiration from the historical preacher but is distinct from them.[3][6][7][8]

Given the absence of any reliable, music‑related information tied to the exact name “Universal Friend,” no further biographical detail can be provided about such an artist beyond noting this likely connection or confusion with the similarly named historical figure and band.[1][3][7] Any more specific claims about releases, career milestones, or personal history would be speculative and are therefore not included here.

## Fun Facts
- The name “Public Universal Friend” originally belongs to an 18th‑century American evangelist who rejected their birth name Jemima Wilkinson and conventional gendered pronouns after a claimed spiritual rebirth in 1776.[1][2]
- A modern Indianapolis art‑rock/indie‑rock band called Public Universal Friend, led by Jody Galadriel Friend, deliberately borrowed its name from this historical religious figure.[3][6][7]
- Because of this shared naming, music platforms and searches can easily conflate or confuse the historical preacher, the contemporary band Public Universal Friend, and the undeveloped or misattributed Spotify profile labeled “Universal Friend.”[1][3][7]
