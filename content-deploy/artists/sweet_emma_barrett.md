## Biography
Sweet Emma Barrett, born Emma Barrett on March 25, 1897, in New Orleans, Louisiana, was a pioneering self-taught jazz pianist and singer whose career spanned over seven decades. She began playing piano at the age of seven and was performing publicly by the time she was twelve, quickly becoming a beloved figure in the New Orleans music scene. Barrett never learned to read music but possessed an extraordinary ear, able to transpose pieces instantly by ear. Her early career included stints with the Original Tuxedo Orchestra under Oscar 'Papa' Celestin and William Ridgely, and later with ensembles led by Sidney Desvigne, Armand Piron, and John Robichaux. After a semi-retirement, Barrett returned to prominence in the late 1940s, performing at the Happy Landing Club and eventually forming her own group, Sweet Emma and the Bells, which toured nationally and internationally.

Barrett was known for her distinctive barrelhouse piano style and her unique vocal delivery, often laced with double entendres and humor. Her flamboyant stage presence, marked by her signature red beanie cap and garters adorned with jingling bells, earned her the nickname 'the Bell Gal.' She became a featured performer with the Preservation Hall Jazz Band and was celebrated for breaking barriers for women in jazz. Barrett's 1961 recording debut brought her international fame, and she continued to perform and record into her later years, leaving a lasting legacy as an ambassador of New Orleans jazz.
