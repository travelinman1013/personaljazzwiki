## Biography
Marie Knight (née Roach), born around 1920-1925 (sources vary on exact year and place, possibly Attapulgus, Georgia, Sanford, Florida, or Brooklyn, NY), grew up in Newark, New Jersey, in a Church of God in Christ family. She began singing in church at age 5, became a youth choir soloist by 9, and taught herself piano. Starting in 1939, she toured the gospel circuit with evangelist Frances Robinson, made her first recordings in 1946 with the Sunset Four, and soon joined Sister Rosetta Tharpe after being spotted at Harlem's Golden Gate Auditorium. With Tharpe, she performed as the 'sinner' to Tharpe's 'saint,' scoring hits like 'Up Above My Head' (#6 R&B, 1948) and her solo 'Gospel Train' (#9 R&B, 1949).[1][2]

Transitioning solo around 1951, Knight formed the backing group The Millionaires and recorded the 1956 gospel album *Songs of the Gospel*. She shifted to secular R&B in the late 1950s, releasing on labels like Decca, Mercury, and Okeh, with hits including 'I Can't Sit Down' with Rex Garvin (#94 pop, 1959), 'Come Tomorrow' (1961, later covered by Manfred Mann), and 'Cry Me a River' (#35 R&B, 1965). She toured with Brook Benton, the Drifters, Clyde McPhatter, and in Britain with Humphrey Lyttelton. Tragedy struck in 1949 when her two children and mother died in a Newark fire during a Tharpe tour.[1][2]

In the 1970s, Knight returned to gospel, becoming a minister at Gates of Prayer Church in New York City, and recorded albums like *Marie Knight: Today* (1975) and *Lord, I’ve Tried* (1979). She contributed to a 2002 Tharpe tribute and released *Let Us Get Together* (2007), featuring Rev. Gary Davis songs with guitarist Larry Campbell. Known for her powerful contralto blending gospel fire with R&B soul—genres including northern soul—Knight died August 30, 2009, in Harlem from pneumonia complications, aged 89.[1][2]
