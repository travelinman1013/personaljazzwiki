## Biography
JD McPherson, born Jonathan David McPherson on April 14, 1977, in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, grew up on a cattle ranch near Talihina, shaped by his father's background as a farmer and ex-army and his mother's role as a church minister. He began playing guitar at age 13, and by 16 was active in local punk bands, later exploring genres from punk to western swing, and developing a deep interest in 1950s rock and roll after discovering Buddy Holly[1][4][5].

McPherson studied visual arts at the University of Oklahoma and earned a Master of Fine Arts from the University of Tulsa, pursuing experimental film and open media while continuing to play music. His career took a pivotal turn when he sent a demo to Jimmy Sutton of Hi-STYLE Records, leading to the release of his debut album 'Signs and Signifiers' in 2010, which was reissued in 2012 by Rounder Records to critical acclaim. Over the next decade, McPherson released four more studio albums and two EPs, including the widely praised 'Undivided Heart & Soul' (2017), and performed at major festivals such as Glastonbury, Bonnaroo, and Newport Folk Festival[1][2][4].

McPherson's musical style is rooted in rockabilly, rhythm and blues, and foundational rock 'n' roll, but he is known for blending these influences with elements of glam, new wave, surf rock, and post-punk. He draws inspiration from both the "black side" of rock 'n' roll and classic American sounds, aiming to create music that is timeless yet forward-thinking. His innovative approach and mastery of genre fundamentals have earned him recognition as a leading figure in the modern roots music scene, with Rolling Stone describing his work as "Timeless, forward-thinking rock & roll"[2][4][5].
