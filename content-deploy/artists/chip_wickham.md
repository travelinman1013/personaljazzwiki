## Biography
Chip Wickham is a British jazz saxophonist, flautist, and producer whose career bridges the worlds of UK breakbeat, hip-hop, and contemporary jazz. Born in Brighton and later studying in Manchester, Wickham first gained recognition in the early 2000s as part of the influential Manchester scene, collaborating with artists such as Rae & Christian, The Pharcyde, Nightmares On Wax, and Graham Massey. Despite his early immersion in electronic and breakbeat music, jazz remained his primary passion, leading him to work with acclaimed trumpeter Matthew Halsall and join the Gondwana Records family, contributing to the label's emergence as a hub for modern British jazz.[1][2][3][4][5]

Wickham's solo career took off later in life, with his debut solo album arriving when he was 42. His music draws deeply from spiritual jazz, the classic sounds of 1960s British jazz, and contemporary influences like Jazzanova and The Cinematic Orchestra. His albums are noted for their soulful grooves, heartfelt melodies, and a blend of hard-swinging and rhythmically adventurous compositions. Now dividing his time between the UK, Spain, and the Middle East, Wickham is recognized for his innovative approach to jazz, both as a bandleader and collaborator, and for his role in connecting the UK and Spanish jazz scenes.[1][3][4][5][6]

Wickham's legacy is marked by his ability to bridge genres and generations, drawing inspiration from jazz greats such as Roland Kirk, Yusef Lateef, and Tubby Hayes, while also influencing a new wave of jazz musicians in the UK and beyond. His ongoing collaborations and genre-crossing projects have cemented his reputation as a vital and creative force in contemporary jazz.[1][3][4][5]
