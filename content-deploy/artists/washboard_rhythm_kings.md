# WASHBOARD RHYTHM KINGS

## Biography
The Washboard Rhythm Kings were not a fixed performing band but a loose studio aggregation of jazz, blues, and hokum musicians active primarily between 1930 and 1936. They began recording under names like Alabama Washboard Stompers in 1930, transitioned to Washboard Rhythm Kings in 1931, and later used aliases such as Washboard Rhythm Boys (1932-1933), Georgia Washboard Stompers (1934-1935), and others for various labels. These quick pick-up sessions featured talented but often obscure players improvising on the spot, producing a series of remarkable records blending jazz, blues, and hokum styles characterized by crude humor, suggestive lyrics, and energetic washboard rhythms.[1][2][3][4][5][7]

Their musical style emphasized rhythmic drive with washboard as a key percussion instrument, alongside small combos playing hokum tunes, jazz standards like 'Tiger Rag' and 'St. Louis Blues,' and originals such as 'Hard Corn,' 'Pepper Steak,' and 'Depression Stomp.' Recorded for multiple labels, the group captured the vibrant, improvisational spirit of 1930s Chicago and Southern jazz scenes, with influences from New Orleans roots and South Side Chicago artists. The sessions highlighted spontaneous interplay among high-caliber but anonymous musicians, many unknown even today.[3][4]

Though they never toured or performed live as a unit, their recordings endure as excellent examples of pre-war hokum and washboard jazz, influencing later appreciations of obscure 1930s jazz aggregations. Their legacy lies in preserving raw, humorous, and rhythmically innovative small-band music from the Great Depression era, bridging blues, jazz, and novelty styles.[3][5]

## Fun Facts
- The Washboard Rhythm Kings never existed as a live performing band or had fixed personnel; they were purely a studio name for pick-up sessions with rotating obscure musicians.[3][5]
- They recorded under multiple aliases including Alabama Washboard Stompers (1930), Georgia Washboard Stompers (1934-35), and Washboard Rhythm Boys, often for the same quick sessions.[1][2][7]
- Lyrics frequently featured crude hokum humor and suggestive metaphors, akin to Harlem Hamfats and Clarence Williams’ washboard bands.[3]
- Some musicians remain completely unknown to this day, despite the high caliber of the recordings.[3]
