## Biography
ZZ Top, formed in Houston, Texas, in 1969 by guitarist-vocalist Billy Gibbons after his previous band Moving Sidewalks disbanded, quickly assembled its core lineup with drummer Frank Beard and bassist-vocalist Dusty Hill, who had played together in American Blues. Gibbons, born in Houston in 1949 to a musician father who encouraged his early interest in percussion through lessons with Tito Puente, brought a blues-infused guitar style drawing from artists like John Lee Hooker and Muddy Waters. The band signed with London Records within a year, releasing their debut ZZ Top's First Album in 1971, followed by Rio Grande Mud (1972) and the breakthrough Tres Hombres (1973), featuring the radio hit 'La Grange' inspired by a local brothel, establishing their gritty southern blues-rock sound.[1][2][3][5]

## Fun Facts
- ZZ Top members once unknowingly played in fraudulent 'Zombies' tours in 1969, impersonating the British band after its hit 'Time of the Season' to capitalize on its success.[4]
- Their iconic Worldwide Texas Tour (1976-1977) featured performances on a Texas-shaped stage with live props including cacti, snakes, and longhorn cattle.[1][3]
- Early member Lanier Greig, who helped shape their initial electric blues sound, was ousted shortly after formation and died young.[4]
- Billy Gibbons' pre-ZZ Top band Moving Sidewalks opened for Jimi Hendrix in the U.S. but faced label issues delaying their album Flash until after psychedelia's decline.[4]
