## Biography
Terry Reid, born Terrance James Reid on November 13, 1949, in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, England, was a prodigious English rock singer-songwriter and guitarist renowned for his soulful, emotive vocal style and dynamic guitar work. Reid began his musical journey in his teens, leaving school at 15 to join Peter Jay & the Jaywalkers after being discovered by drummer Peter Jay. The Jaywalkers achieved modest success with the single 'The Hand Don't Fit the Glove' in 1967, but soon disbanded, prompting Reid to embark on a solo career.

In the late 1960s, Reid quickly gained recognition, supporting legendary acts such as the Rolling Stones, Cream, Jethro Tull, and Fleetwood Mac on major tours. His debut album, 'Bang Bang, You're Terry Reid,' showcased his eclectic blend of rock, soul, and blues, though it struggled commercially. Despite this, his powerful voice and songwriting attracted the admiration of peers and critics alike—Aretha Franklin famously cited him among the best artists in London. Reid's career was marked by both opportunity and near-misses: he notably declined offers to front Led Zeppelin and Deep Purple, instead recommending Robert Plant to Jimmy Page. After releasing several acclaimed albums and enduring challenging record deals, Reid relocated to the United States, where he continued to record, tour, and collaborate with a diverse array of artists.

Reid's songs have been covered by a wide range of musicians, and his influence is evident in both classic and contemporary rock circles. His legacy endures through his recordings, his role in shaping the careers of others, and his reputation as one of Britain's most distinctive and underappreciated vocal talents. Terry Reid passed away on August 4, 2025, in Rancho Mirage, California, leaving behind a rich and influential musical heritage.
