## Biography
Sierra Hull, born in Byrdstown, Tennessee, began playing mandolin at age eight after receiving the instrument as a gift from her grandmother. Her father taught her initial tunes and chords, leading her to participate in weekly jams and regional contests by age ten. Recognized as a child prodigy, she released her first album *Angel Mountain* around that time and performed on the Grand Ole Opry stage at age eleven, invited by Alison Krauss. At twelve, she signed with Rounder Records, releasing *Secrets* which reached No. 2 on the Billboard Top Bluegrass Albums Chart, followed by three more albums showcasing her songwriting, instrumental, and vocal skills.[1][2][3]

Hull's career advanced rapidly as a teenager, performing at prestigious venues like the White House, Kennedy Center, and Carnegie Hall. In 2009, she became the first bluegrass musician to receive the Berklee College of Music Presidential Scholarship. Her style, rooted in traditional bluegrass, evolved into innovative newgrass and Americana, blending genres while maintaining virtuosic mandolin mastery. Albums like *Weighted Mind* (2016, produced by Béla Fleck) and *25 Trips* (2020) earned Grammy nominations, and her independent release *A Tip Toe High Wire* (2025) continues to push boundaries.[1][2][3][4][6]

A six-time (now seven-time) IBMA Mandolin Player of the Year—the first and only woman to receive this honor—Hull has collaborated with icons and mentors younger musicians. Now based in Nashville, she is celebrated as a leader advancing bluegrass, drawing new audiences through her inventive sound and performances on iconic stages.[1][3][4]
