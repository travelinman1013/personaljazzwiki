## Biography
Louis Prima, born in New Orleans in 1910, was a dynamic American trumpeter, singer, and bandleader whose career spanned jazz, swing, and jump blues. He began leading bands in the late 1920s, quickly establishing himself in the New York and Los Angeles club scenes, and became known for his exuberant stage presence and raspy vocals. Prima composed enduring swing standards such as 'Sing, Sing, Sing' and 'Jump, Jive an’ Wail,' and led several successful big bands throughout the 1930s and 1940s, adapting his style to the evolving tastes of American popular music.[1][2][4]

Keely Smith, born Dorothy Keely in Norfolk, Virginia in 1928, emerged as a talented vocalist in her teens, performing with naval dance bands during World War II. She met Prima in 1947 and joined his band as the lead female vocalist, quickly becoming his musical and comedic foil. Their partnership, both professional and romantic, flourished after their marriage in 1953. Together with saxophonist Sam Butera and The Witnesses, Prima and Smith pioneered a unique Las Vegas lounge act in the 1950s, blending swing, jump blues, and comic banter. Their chemistry and innovative sound revitalized Prima’s career and brought Smith widespread acclaim, including a Grammy Award for 'That Old Black Magic' in 1959.[3][4][5]

The duo’s influence extended beyond their own era, inspiring later generations of swing and jazz musicians. Their lively performances and genre-blending style helped popularize the Las Vegas lounge scene and left a lasting legacy in American music. Smith continued to perform and record after their partnership ended, earning recognition for her solo work and helping to revive interest in big band and swing music in subsequent decades.[3][5]
