## Biography
Melanie De Biasio is a Belgian jazz singer, flutist, composer, and bandleader known for her atmospheric, minimalist approach that blurs boundaries between jazz, blues, soul, and art-pop. Born on December 2, 1978 in Charleroi, Belgium, to a Belgian mother and an Italian father, she began studying classical ballet at a very young age and took up the transverse flute around the age of eight, which became her primary instrument and gateway into formal music training. Growing up between industrial Charleroi and an Italian family background gave her both a sense of raw, urban realism and Mediterranean warmth, elements that later colored the emotional intensity and introspective tone of her work.

After training in classical music and jazz—eventually studying at the Conservatoire Royal de Bruxelles—De Biasio initially saw herself more as an instrumentalist than a vocalist and was reportedly a reluctant singer before friends and collaborators encouraged her to step forward as a frontwoman. She first attracted attention with her debut album “A Stomach Is Burning,” which introduced her smoky, pared-back sound, but it was the second album “No Deal” that significantly broadened her international profile and cemented her reputation as a distinctive voice in contemporary jazz-adjacent music. Subsequent projects, including the long-form piece “Blackened Cities” and the album “Lilies,” deepened her signature mix of sparse instrumentation, hypnotic grooves, and poetic lyrics; “Lilies” in particular drew on a period when she lost her voice for about a year in 2004, turning a personal crisis into a meditative exploration of silence, fear, and renewal.

Over time, De Biasio’s style has often been described as cinematic and otherworldly, drawing on influences from trip-hop, psychedelic rock, and ambient music as much as from classic jazz singers. Rather than focusing on virtuosic display, she tends to strip arrangements down to essentials—voice, flute, and a small, tightly knit band—using space, repetition, and subtle dynamic shifts to create tension and deep emotional resonance. Critics and festival programmers increasingly place her among the most creative European jazz vocalists of her generation, and she has become a regular presence on major international stages while also investing energy into L’Alba, a creative house and residency space in her hometown of Charleroi that reflects her broader vision of art as a communal, cross-disciplinary practice.

## Fun Facts
- She trained in classical ballet from early childhood before becoming known as a singer and flutist.
- She initially identified more as an instrumentalist and was hesitant about singing, only embracing the role of vocalist after encouragement from friends.
- Her album “Lilies” is closely tied to a period when she temporarily lost her voice, transforming that setback into a central artistic theme.
- Beyond music, she has been involved in restoring an old neo-classical mansion in Charleroi, turning it into L’Alba, a multidisciplinary creative space for artists.
