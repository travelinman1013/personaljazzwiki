## Biography
Edward Hammond Boatner Jr., known professionally as Sonny Stitt, was born on February 2, 1924, in Boston, Massachusetts, and grew up in Saginaw, Michigan, in a musically rich family environment. His parents were music teachers, and his brother was a pianist, which fostered his early musical development. Stitt began his musical journey on piano before transitioning to clarinet and eventually settling on the alto saxophone at age seven. His early training in music theory and performance fundamentals prepared him for what would become a prolific career in jazz. In the early 1940s, he began his professional career with Tiny Bradshaw's band before joining the pioneering bebop ensembles of Billy Eckstine and Dizzy Gillespie in the mid-1940s, where he quickly established himself as one of the first and most fluent bebop saxophonists.

Stitt's career was marked by extraordinary versatility and productivity, as he mastered the alto, tenor, and baritone saxophones and recorded over 100 albums throughout his lifetime. His romantic style of improvising featured broken phrases, free accenting, and chromatic harmonies that drew comparisons to Charlie Parker, whom he met and played with in Kansas City in 1943. By the early 1950s, Stitt had successfully adapted his bebop style to multiple saxophones and began developing a distinctive lyric tenor saxophone sound influenced by Lester Young. He spent much of his career leading small groups and touring extensively, earning the nickname "The Lone Wolf" from jazz critic Dan Morgenstern. Despite personal challenges, including a year in a rehabilitation facility for drug-related issues and time served in Lexington prison between 1948-49, Stitt continued to evolve musically, embracing hard bop and funk jazz while maintaining his technical mastery and improvisational brilliance.

Sonny Stitt passed away on July 22, 1982, in Washington, D.C., leaving behind a rich and influential legacy in jazz history. Though he never achieved the same level of fame as some contemporaries like Charlie Parker or John Coltrane, Stitt occupies an important place in jazz history as one of the most consistently swinging and well-documented saxophonists of his era. His influence extended to later generations of performers, including Branford Marsalis, Kenny Garrett, Joshua Redman, and Courtney Pine, who built upon the modern jazz saxophone sound that Stitt helped establish. His extensive international tours, particularly in Europe and Japan during the 1950s and 1960s, and his participation in landmark projects like the Giants of Jazz tour in the 1970s, demonstrated his enduring relevance and respect within the jazz community.

## Fun Facts
- Sonny Stitt was one of the few jazz musicians to experiment with the electric saxophone, demonstrating his willingness to explore new musical directions beyond traditional bebop and hard bop.
- Despite being called 'one of the most consistently swinging performers in contemporary jazz' by critic Leonard Feather, Stitt remains one of the most overlooked masters of bebop and hard bop, never achieving the same level of fame as some of his contemporaries despite recording over 100 albums.
- Stitt earned the nickname 'The Lone Wolf' from jazz critic Dan Morgenstern due to his heavy touring and performing schedule, spending much of his career leading small groups and maintaining an extensive international presence.
- In his later years, Stitt experienced a musical rejuvenation; Red Holloway, who toured with him in the late 1970s, noted a marked improvement in his playing, and his last recordings were made in Japan, demonstrating his continued relevance and touring activity until his death in 1982.
