## Biography
"Whip Appeal" is not a musical artist, but rather a song released in 1990 by American R&B artist and producer Babyface (Kenneth Brian Edmonds). The song served as the third single from Babyface's second album, Tender Lover, and was co-written by Babyface and Perri "Pebbles" Reid, with production by Babyface and L.A. Reid. Released on February 22, 1990, by SOLAR Records and Epic Records, the track became one of Babyface's signature hits during the early 1990s R&B era. The song exemplified the quiet storm style that defined much of Babyface's production work and established him as a major force in contemporary R&B music.

## Fun Facts
- Babyface met his future wife Tracey Edmonds when she auditioned for the 'Whip Appeal' music video in 1990, though she couldn't appear in it due to contracting chicken pox. They reconnected months later during casting for another video and married in 1992.
- The 'Whip Appeal' music video featured actress Holly Robinson Peete as a sultry radio host and was directed by Jim Yukich, who had previously directed many music videos for Phil Collins and Genesis.
- Music journalist John Leland described 'Whip Appeal' in a 1990 Newsday article as 'suggestive but not rude' and compared it to 'the risque love ballad that has eluded Prince the last few years.'
