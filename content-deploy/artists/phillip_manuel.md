# PHILLIP MANUEL

## Biography
Phillip Manuel, a native of New Orleans, was born into a musical family where his father, described by Manuel as 'the greatest vocalist I've ever known,' began teaching him songs at age four or five, fostering an innate talent for singing.[3] He made his public debut at age 8, prodded by Aaron Neville, and performed his first paid gig three years later at The Exchequer on Elysian Fields Avenue, while also recording his first record at 16 and performing professionally since age 11.[2][4] Growing up in New Orleans honed his jazz skills, leading to tours in the early 1990s with trumpeter Terence Blanchard, including a year singing in Portuguese.[2]

Manuel's career as a jazz vocalist flourished with his 2000 MAXJAZZ debut album *Love Happened to Me*, featuring eclectic standards, modern covers like Stevie Wonder's 'I Wish' and Sting's 'Fragile,' and originals, backed by luminaries such as Nicholas Payton, Ellis Marsalis, Peter Martin, and Steve Masakowski.[1] Known for his smooth, soothing, sophisticated, and soulful voice, Manuel excels in transforming uptempo tunes into gymnastic displays and ballads into tender sonic ambrosia.[1][6] He has become a mainstay at clubs and festivals worldwide, performing with greats like Terence Blanchard.[5]

His New Orleans roots infuse his music with eclectic swing, and he continues to perform at events like JazzAscona in 2025, emphasizing the timeless power of the human voice as the ultimate instrument, drawing comparisons to Ella Fitzgerald, Sinatra, Tony Bennett, Nat King Cole, and Billy Eckstine.[3]
