## Biography
IKE TURNER'S KINGS OF RHYTHM is a foundational American rhythm and blues group formed in the late 1940s in Clarksdale, Mississippi, by Ike Turner, who led the band throughout his career. Originally evolving from a big band ensemble called the Tophatters, the Kings of Rhythm quickly became a fixture in the regional blues and R&B circuit, known for their energetic live performances and tight musicianship. In 1951, the group recorded 'Rocket 88' (credited to Jackie Brenston and His Delta Cats), a track widely considered one of the first rock and roll records, marking a pivotal moment in music history.

Through the 1950s and 1960s, the Kings of Rhythm served as both Ike Turner's primary band and the backbone of the Ike & Tina Turner Revue, which achieved national fame with hits like 'A Fool in Love' and 'Proud Mary.' The group underwent numerous lineup changes but remained a proving ground for talented musicians, including future stars like Tina Turner and, briefly, Jimi Hendrix. Their musical style blended blues, R&B, early rock and roll, and later incorporated elements of soul and funk, reflecting Ike Turner's innovative approach as a bandleader, producer, and arranger.

After the dissolution of the Ike & Tina Turner Revue in the late 1970s, Turner revived the Kings of Rhythm in the 2000s, recording Grammy-nominated and award-winning albums. The band's legacy is cemented not only by their groundbreaking recordings but also by their influence on the development of rock and roll, rhythm and blues, and soul music. The Kings of Rhythm continue to perform, preserving the spirit and sound that helped shape American popular music.
