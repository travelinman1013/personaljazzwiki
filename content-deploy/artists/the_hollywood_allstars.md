## Biography
The Hollywood Allstars are a dynamic supergroup formed by Grammy-nominated songwriter, producer, and keyboardist Steve Gaspár, who envisioned a band that would celebrate and preserve the classic 'Horn Band – Hammond Organ' sound. Based in the United States, the group brings together elite musicians who have performed and recorded with some of the most legendary names in rock, soul, and R&B, including The Rolling Stones, James Brown, Blood Sweat & Tears, Tower of Power, and The Blues Brothers. Their performances are known for energetic arrangements that blend original material with iconic songs from the 1960s through the 1980s, as well as contemporary classics.

The band's lineup features Steve Gaspár on Hammond organ and piano, guitarist Andy Abel, drummer Lee Finkelstein (of The Original Blues Brothers Band), and vocalist Tommy Bowes (former lead singer of Tower of Power and Blood Sweat & Tears). Other notable members include vocalist Chevy Chevis, who has sung with Beyoncé, Madonna, Ariana Grande, Adele, and Jennifer Lopez, and the Uptown Horns, a renowned horn section. Their debut EP, 'Field of Grace,' showcases both their original songwriting and their reverence for the rich traditions of American rock and R&B. The Hollywood Allstars' live shows are celebrated for their musicianship, high-energy performances, and the unique chemistry of seasoned artists coming together to create something greater than the sum of its parts.

The band has become known for its ability to bridge generations of music lovers, offering a 'chronological journey' through the history of rock and soul while introducing new material that honors the genre's roots. Their commitment to the big band sound and live instrumentation has earned them a devoted following among fans of classic rock, R&B, and horn-driven music.
