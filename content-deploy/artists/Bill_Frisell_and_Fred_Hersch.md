## Biography
Bill Frisell and Fred Hersch are two of the most distinctive voices in contemporary jazz, each with a career spanning decades and a reputation for innovation and sensitivity. Frisell, born in Baltimore, Maryland, emerged as a guitarist with a singular approach, blending jazz with country, rock, and Americana, and is often cited as one of the most original guitarists of the past 30 years[1]. Hersch, born in Cincinnati, Ohio, is a celebrated pianist, composer, and 17-time Grammy nominee, known for his lyrical touch and deep improvisational skills; he was the first to play weeklong solo engagements at New York’s Village Vanguard[3]. Both artists began their musical journeys early—Hersch started piano at age four and was composing by eight, while Frisell’s eclectic style developed through immersion in diverse genres. Their careers blossomed in the 1980s and 1990s, with Frisell gaining acclaim for albums like *Lookout For Hope* and *Have a Little Faith*, and Hersch establishing himself as a leading trio pianist and a sensitive accompanist for vocalists[2][3].

Despite their parallel trajectories, Frisell and Hersch have rarely recorded together, making their 1998 duo album *Songs We Know* a notable exception. The project was Hersch’s idea, bringing together two musicians who share a love for jazz standards but had seldom crossed paths professionally[1]. Their collaboration is marked by a relaxed, conversational interplay, highlighting Frisell’s textural guitar work and Hersch’s melodic piano lines. Both are known for reinterpreting familiar material with fresh harmonic and rhythmic ideas, and their partnership stands out for its rarity and mutual respect. Frisell’s legacy lies in his genre-blurring compositions and sonic experimentation, while Hersch is celebrated for his compositional depth and his role in advancing the jazz piano trio format[1][3][4].

## Fun Facts
- Fred Hersch was the first pianist to play weeklong solo engagements at New York’s legendary Village Vanguard, a milestone in jazz history[3].
- Bill Frisell is known for playing not only guitar but also banjo, ukulele, and even clarinet on his recordings, showcasing his eclectic instrumental palette[2].
- Despite both being on Nonesuch Records and occasional live gigs in the 1980s, Frisell and Hersch only recorded one studio album together, *Songs We Know*, in 1998[1][2].
- Hersch’s autobiography, *Good Things Happen Slowly*, recounts how he got his big break when Art Pepper invited him onstage to sit in after firing the hired pianist—an event that launched his career[3].
