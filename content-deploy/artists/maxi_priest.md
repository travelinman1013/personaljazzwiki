## Biography
Max Alfred Elliott, better known as Maxi Priest, was born on 10 June 1961 in Lewisham, London, to Jamaican parents who had emigrated to the UK in the 1950s.[2][6] He grew up in a deeply musical, church-centered household where his mother was a Pentecostal missionary, and he absorbed gospel alongside the reggae, R&B, and soul records that filled the home.[1][2] As a teenager in South London he first engaged with sound system culture by lifting speaker boxes for Jah Shaka and Negus Negast, and soon became a founding member of the influential Saxon Studio International sound system, where he graduated from crew member to singer at youth clubs and house parties.[2][3] This vibrant London Caribbean milieu in the late 1970s and early 1980s, combined with his Jamaican roots, nurtured the lovers rock style that would define his career.[3][4][6]

Priest’s recording career began in the early 1980s with independent singles and productions such as co‑producing Phillip Levi’s "Mi God Mi King" with Paul Robinson, the first British reggae production to reach No. 1 on the Jamaican charts.[3][4] His early discomix releases, including the track "Sensi" with Papa Levi on the Level Vibes label, built his reputation across both dancehall and conscious roots audiences.[2] After topping UK Black music charts with "Should I" in 1985, he released the albums "You’re Safe" and then "Intentions," collaborating with British reggae band Aswad and headlining major venues like Brixton Academy and Hammersmith Odeon before performing at Jamaica’s prestigious Reggae Sunsplash.[3][5] His self-titled album "Maxi" (issued as "Maxi Priest" in North America) in 1988, featuring a hit cover of Cat Stevens’ "Wild World" recorded with Sly Dunbar and Robbie Shakespeare, helped establish him as one of the leading British reggae vocalists.[2]

Through the late 1980s and 1990s, Maxi Priest became a global ambassador for lovers rock and reggae fusion, blending smooth reggae rhythms with contemporary R&B to reach mainstream audiences.[2][3][4] He scored one of the few U.S. Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 hits by a British reggae artist with "Close to You" in 1990, and followed with further crossover successes including the U.S. Top 10 duet "Set the Night to Music" with Roberta Flack in 1991 and the hit "That Girl" with Shaggy in 1996.[1][2][3] His sustained output, from early sound-system singles through albums like "Man with the Fun" and later works such as "Easy to Love," along with tours and recordings with UB40, cemented his status as a key figure in internationalizing lovers rock and reggae fusion.[1][3][4] Celebrated by fans as the "King of Lovers Rock," Priest’s legacy lies in showing that reggae could be tender, romantic, and commercially successful worldwide while remaining rooted in Caribbean sound system culture.[1][4][6]

## Fun Facts
- Before becoming known as a singer, Maxi Priest worked as a carpenter and first entered the music business by being hired to build speaker boxes for the Saxon International sound system, where his vocal talent was then discovered.[3][4]
