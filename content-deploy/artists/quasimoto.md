## Biography
Quasimoto is the acclaimed animated alter ego of producer and rapper Madlib (Otis Jackson, Jr.), originating from Oxnard, California. Conceived in the mid-1990s, Quasimoto began as a creative experiment on Madlib’s private beat tapes, where he manipulated his own voice to create the high-pitched, surreal persona known as 'Lord Quas.' The character made early appearances on records by Peanut Butter Wolf and Lootpack, but truly emerged with the 2000 release of the debut album 'The Unseen' on Stones Throw Records, quickly gaining cult status in underground hip hop circles.

Quasimoto’s music is characterized by its experimental approach, blending elements of jazz, psychedelic textures, and off-kilter beats with abstract, often irreverent lyricism. Madlib’s unique production style—marked by dense sampling and unconventional song structures—finds a perfect foil in Quasimoto’s mischievous, cartoonish delivery. The project’s discography includes three main albums: 'The Unseen' (2000), 'The Further Adventures of Lord Quas' (2005), and 'Yessir…Whatever' (2013), each expanding the mythos of Lord Quas and cementing Quasimoto’s legacy as a pioneering force in alternative and experimental hip hop.

Beyond his own records, Quasimoto’s influence extends through Madlib’s broader body of work, inspiring a generation of artists to embrace alter egos, genre fusion, and a boundary-pushing ethos. The illustrated character of Lord Quas—often depicted as a blue or yellow figure with a brick—has become an icon of underground hip hop, representing both Madlib’s creative freedom and the enduring appeal of musical experimentation.

## Fun Facts
- Quasimoto’s distinctive high-pitched voice was created by Madlib slowing down his own vocals, recording them, and then speeding them up.
- The character Lord Quas is often depicted holding a brick, a recurring visual motif in album art and merchandise.
- Quasimoto was originally intended to remain an anonymous, unseen figure, but eventually became an illustrated mascot for Stones Throw Records.
- Madlib reportedly produced much of the 'Bandana' album with Freddie Gibbs using only an iPad.
