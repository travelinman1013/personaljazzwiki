## Biography
New Breed Brass Band is a dynamic New Orleans-based ensemble known for their energetic blend of jazz, funk, and traditional brass band music. The group is led by snare drummer Jenard Andrews, whose deep familial ties to the New Orleans music scene include being the nephew of the celebrated trombonist Troy 'Trombone Shorty' Andrews.

The band has performed at major festivals and shared stages with prominent acts, including frequent collaborations with Trombone Shorty, who has encouraged and mentored the group since its inception. 

New Breed Brass Band’s legacy is intertwined with their commitment to both innovation and tradition, making them a vital force in the ongoing evolution of New Orleans music.
