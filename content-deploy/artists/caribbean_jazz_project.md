## Biography
The Caribbean Jazz Project (CJP) was formed in 1995 by vibraphonist and marimba specialist Dave Samuels, along with steel pan musician Andy Narell and saxophonist Paquito D'Rivera. Their debut concert took place in New York's Central Park, marking the beginning of a dynamic musical journey. The group's early years were highlighted by their self-titled debut album and 'Island Stories,' both featuring the original trio. Following the departure of Narell and D'Rivera, Samuels reformed the band with guitarist Steve Khan and flutist Dave Valentin, leading to further albums and a Grammy Award for Best Latin Jazz Album with 'The Gathering' in 2002. Over the years, CJP has evolved, incorporating musicians like Diego Urcola, Dario Eskenazi, Oscar Stagnaro, Mark Walker, and Roberto Quintero. Their music blends Latin jazz, Afro-Cuban rhythms, and Caribbean influences, creating a vibrant and dynamic sound. The Caribbean Jazz Project has been recognized for its contributions to Latin jazz, winning multiple Grammy Awards and maintaining a strong presence in the jazz scene. Dave Samuels, a key figure in the band, has a rich musical background, having played with notable artists like Spyro Gyra and Gerry Mulligan before founding CJP. His early life involved studying psychology at Boston University and beginning his musical career with local bands, eventually leading to his role as a premier mallet player.
