## Biography
Aston Francis Barrett, known as 'Family Man' or 'Fams,' was born on November 22, 1946, in Kingston, Jamaica. He was the fourth of five children and the first son of Wilfred and Violet Barrett. From a young age, Barrett was drawn to music, singing along to soul records before teaching himself the bass and even building his first bass guitar from scratch. He and his younger brother Carlton began their musical journey as welders by day and session musicians by night, eventually rising to prominence in the Jamaican music scene. Barrett's early career included work with several influential bands and producers, notably Lee 'Scratch' Perry's house band, the Upsetters, and the Hippy Boys, which became the core rhythm section for Bob Marley & The Wailers in 1972. As the band's bandleader, arranger, and co-producer, Barrett played a pivotal role in shaping the sound of reggae, pioneering the genre's signature bass-heavy style and the 'one drop' rhythm alongside his brother. His melodic, earthy bass lines and innovative arrangements became synonymous with the Wailers' recordings and live performances, helping to propel Bob Marley to global stardom. After Marley's death in 1981, Barrett continued to lead The Wailers as a touring band, cementing his legacy as a foundational figure in reggae and dub music.
