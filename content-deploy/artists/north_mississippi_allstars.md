## Biography
North Mississippi Allstars is a celebrated blues-rock band formed in 1996 in Hernando, Mississippi, by brothers Luther (guitar, vocals) and Cody Dickinson (drums, keyboards, electric washboard), joined by bassist Chris Chew. The sons of renowned Memphis producer and musician Jim Dickinson, Luther and Cody grew up immersed in the rich musical traditions of North Mississippi, learning directly from local blues legends such as R.L. Burnside, Junior Kimbrough, and Otha Turner. Their early exposure to these artists, combined with their father's influence, shaped the band's deep connection to the region's hill country blues and southern rock roots.[1][3][5]

The group quickly gained attention with their debut album, 'Shake Hands With Shorty' (2000), which earned a Grammy nomination for Best Contemporary Blues Album and a W.C. Handy Award for Best New Artist Debut. Their subsequent albums, including '51 Phantom' (2001) and 'Electric Blue Watermelon' (2005), also received Grammy nominations, solidifying their reputation as leading innovators in modern blues. Over the years, the band has evolved its sound by blending traditional blues with rock, gospel, and improvisational elements, while maintaining a deep respect for their musical heritage. The Allstars have released a string of acclaimed albums and are recognized for their energetic live performances, often featuring collaborations with notable musicians from the blues and roots music communities.[1][3][4][5]

Beyond their core trio, the Dickinson brothers have engaged in numerous side projects and collaborations, further expanding their musical reach. Luther has worked with the Black Crowes and formed groups like the South Memphis String Band and The Wandering, while Cody has led projects such as Hill Country Revue. The band's enduring legacy lies in their ability to honor the traditions of North Mississippi blues while continually pushing the genre forward, inspiring a new generation of musicians and fans.[1][4][5]
