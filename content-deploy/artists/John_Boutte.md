## Biography
John Boutté is a celebrated jazz and soul singer from New Orleans, Louisiana, born on November 3, 1958, into a large Creole family in the city’s historic Seventh Ward. Growing up, he was immersed in the vibrant musical culture of New Orleans, surrounded by second-line parades, church choirs, and the sounds of jazz, R&B, and funk that defined his neighborhood. Early exposure to local legends and the influence of his musically gifted family, especially his sister Lillian Boutté, shaped his artistic sensibility. He began playing cornet at age eight and was active in school marching bands and street a cappella groups, developing his voice and performance style in the heart of the city’s musical traditions.[1][2][4][5]

After earning a business degree from Xavier University of Louisiana and serving as an officer in the U.S. Army, where he directed gospel choirs, Boutté had a pivotal encounter with Stevie Wonder, who encouraged him to pursue music professionally. He joined his sister on a European tour, launching a career that would see him become one of New Orleans’ most beloved vocalists. Boutté’s discography includes acclaimed albums such as 'Jambalaya,' 'Good Neighbor,' and 'Stew Called New Orleans' (with Paul Sanchez), and his soulful, emotive singing has become synonymous with the spirit of New Orleans. He is perhaps best known to wider audiences for writing and performing the theme song for HBO’s 'Treme,' which brought his music to international attention.[2][4][5]

Boutté’s musical style is a rich blend of jazz, soul, gospel, and R&B, deeply rooted in the traditions of his hometown but marked by a distinctive voice and interpretive depth. His performances are celebrated for their emotional intensity and authenticity, often evoking comparisons to Sam Cooke. Boutté’s legacy is that of a cultural ambassador for New Orleans, giving voice to the city’s joys and struggles, and inspiring both audiences and fellow musicians with his artistry and commitment to his roots.[2][4][5]
