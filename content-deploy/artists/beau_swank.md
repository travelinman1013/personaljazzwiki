- **Origin**: New Orleans, Louisiana, United States

## Biography
Beau Swank is not an individual musician but a **band project created by New Orleans musician and attorney Bob Richardson**, who wrote all of the songs and assembled a cast of seasoned players to bring the material to life.[1][5] Richardson, whose primary career is in architecture and law, grew up with a deep passion for music and songwriting; over many years he wrote and refined a catalog of original songs that eventually became the foundation for Beau Swank’s recordings.[5] Drawing on the rich musical environment of New Orleans and his long-standing love of popular and roots music, he conceived Beau Swank as a studio-focused outlet where experienced musicians could interpret his material with professional polish and stylistic range.[1][5]

The Beau Swank project showcases **song‑driven rock and roots‑influenced music**, with arrangements built around traditional band instrumentation and melodic, lyrically crafted songwriting.[1][5] Rather than functioning as a touring band with a fixed lineup, Beau Swank is described as a “cast” of well‑seasoned musicians, emphasizing Richardson’s role as writer and bandleader and the collaborative, studio‑oriented nature of the recordings.[1] While the group’s public profile remains modest, Beau Swank represents the culmination of Richardson’s lifelong engagement with music, giving permanent recorded form to songs he developed across decades alongside his professional work outside the music industry.[5]

Because Beau Swank has very limited media coverage and no major‑label or chart presence, its broader critical legacy and influence are not documented in mainstream music references. Available information instead highlights it as a carefully crafted personal project, rooted in New Orleans’ creative community and in Richardson’s dual life as a professional architect/lawyer and passionate songwriter.[1][5]
