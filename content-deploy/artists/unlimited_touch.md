## Biography
Unlimited Touch was a pioneering American post-disco and funk group formed in New York City in the early 1980s, with roots in both Mt. Vernon and Brooklyn. The group was instigated by Raymond Reid and William Anderson of Crown Heights Affair, though they did not perform as members. The original lineup included Audrey Wheeler (vocals), Stephanie James (vocals), Lenny Underwood (keyboards), Sandy Anderson (bass), Phil Hamilton (guitar), and Tony Cintron (drums). Signed to Prelude Records, Unlimited Touch quickly made a mark on the club scene with their energetic blend of R&B, disco, and funk, producing music that was embraced by DJs and dancefloors, especially in legendary venues like Paradise Garage.

Their debut single, 'I Hear Music in the Streets' (1980), became a club favorite and was followed by the UK chart hit 'Searching to Find the One' (1981). Their self-titled debut album packaged these singles and showcased their signature sound: full-length dance tracks with strong vocal hooks and sophisticated musicianship. Despite only moderate commercial success on the charts, their influence was significant in the evolution of post-disco and early house music. Internal disputes and label issues led to their dissolution by the end of 1981, though they briefly reunited for the 1983 album 'Yes, We're Ready.'

Unlimited Touch's legacy endures through their impact on dance and electronic music. Their tracks have been widely sampled, most notably by Sean 'Puffy' Combs for Faith Evans' 'All Night Long.' The group's music continues to inspire DJs, producers, and artists in the house and dance genres, cementing their status as influential figures in the post-disco era.
