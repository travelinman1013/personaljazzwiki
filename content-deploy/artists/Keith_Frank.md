## Biography
Keith Frank, born October 9, 1972, in Soileau, Louisiana, is a prominent American zydeco singer, accordionist, and producer, widely recognized as the 'Zydeco Boss.' Growing up in a musical family, Keith was immersed in zydeco from an early age, playing drums in his father Preston Frank's band at just four years old and picking up the accordion by six. Though he initially disliked zydeco, his father's work schedule led Keith to assume greater musical responsibilities, eventually embracing the genre as an integral part of his life[1][2][3][8].

In 1990, while still in high school, Keith formed the Soileau Zydeco Band with his sister Jennifer (bass) and brother Brad (drums). The group quickly gained traction, headlining festivals such as the Finger Lakes GrassRoots Festival and releasing their debut single 'On the Bandstand' in 1992. Frank's innovative approach blended traditional zydeco with R&B and hip-hop influences, helping define the nouveau zydeco sound and earning him a loyal following and the enduring nickname 'The Zydeco Boss.' He has remained a leading figure in the genre, known for energetic performances and original songwriting[1][2][3][8].

Keith Frank's legacy lies in his role as both a guardian and innovator of zydeco, bridging generational divides and expanding the genre's reach. His work with the Soileau Zydeco Band and his commitment to fan engagement have made him a central figure in Louisiana's musical landscape, inspiring new artists and keeping zydeco vibrant into the 21st century[1][2][3][8].
