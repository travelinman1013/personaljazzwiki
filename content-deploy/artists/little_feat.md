## Biography
Little Feat formed in 1969 in Los Angeles, California, when singer-songwriter and guitarist Lowell George was fired from Frank Zappa's Mothers of Invention and encouraged to start his own band. George recruited keyboardist Bill Payne, whom he met during Payne's audition for Zappa, drummer Richie Hayward from George's prior band The Factory, and bassist Roy Estrada, another Mothers alum. Signed quickly to Warner Bros., they released their self-titled debut album in 1971, featuring the classic 'Willin',' followed by 'Sailin' Shoes' in 1972 with hits like the title track and 'Easy to Slip.' The band's early sound blended blues, R&B, country rock, and Southern rock, characterized by George's slide guitar, Payne's virtuoso keyboards, and Hayward's driving drums, creating a unique California cool meets New Orleans funk style.[1][2][3]

By 1973, Estrada left, replaced by guitarist Paul Barrere, bassist Kenny Gradney, and percussionist Sam Clayton, solidifying the classic lineup. Albums like 'Dixie Chicken' (1973) with its title track and 'Fat Man in the Bathtub,' 'Feats Don't Fail Me Now' (1974) featuring 'Oh, Atlanta' and 'Rock and Roll Doctor,' and the live masterpiece 'Waiting for Columbus' (1978) cemented their reputation. Tragedy struck in 1979 when Lowell George died at age 34 from a heart attack during a solo tour, leading to the band's breakup after completing 'Down on the Farm.'[1][2][3]

Little Feat reformed in 1987 with Payne, Barrere, Gradney, Clayton, and Hayward, adding vocalist Craig Fuller and guitarist Fred Tackett. Albums like 'Let It Roll' (1988) marked their return, followed by tours and releases including 'Join the Band' (2009) with guest vocalists like Dave Matthews and Emmylou Harris. The band continues today with Payne, Clayton, Gradney, Tackett, guitarist Scott Sharrard, and drummer Tony Leone, maintaining their eclectic rock legacy.[1][2][3]

- Their 1978 live album 'Waiting for Columbus' is widely regarded as one of the best live rock albums ever recorded.
