## Biography
Houston Person was born on November 10, 1934, in Florence, South Carolina, and emerged as one of jazz's most distinctive tenor saxophonists. Initially drawn to piano as a child, Person switched to tenor saxophone at age 17, a decision that would define his musical legacy. After studying at South Carolina State College, he served in the United States Air Force and was stationed in West Germany, where he played in a service band alongside future jazz luminaries including Don Ellis, Eddie Harris, Cedar Walton, and Leo Wright. This military experience proved formative, exposing him to accomplished musicians who would become lifelong friends and influences.

Following his military service, Person continued his musical education at the prestigious Hartt College of Music in Hartford, Connecticut, before establishing himself in the professional jazz world. He gained recognition through a series of albums for Prestige Records in the 1960s, beginning with his debut on organist Johnny Hammond's 1965 album 'The Stinger' and releasing his first album as a leader, 'Underground Soul,' in 1966. Person became synonymous with soul jazz, developing a big, bluesy tenor sound that drew from R&B honkers like Illinois Jacquet and Gene Ammons while maintaining sophisticated jazz sensibilities.

Person's career reached new heights through his legendary partnership with vocalist Etta Jones, which began in 1973 and lasted until her death in 2001. Though often mistaken for a married couple due to their intense musical and personal connection, they were actually musical partners who created a body of work reminiscent of the Lester Young and Billie Holiday collaboration. Throughout his career spanning over five decades, Person has remained remarkably independent, booking his own gigs, producing his own records, and maintaining an encyclopedic command of the American popular songbook. His straightforward, emotionally direct style has made him a torchbearer of soul jazz and earned him recognition including the Eubie Blake Jazz Award in 1982 and induction into South Carolina State College's Hall of Fame in 1999.

## Fun Facts
- Despite his name suggesting a Texas connection, Houston Person was actually born in Florence, South Carolina, and his name has no relation to the Texas city.
- Person and Etta Jones were so closely associated that they were often mistaken for a married couple, though they were never actually married - only musical partners.
- Person has maintained remarkable independence throughout his career, booking his own gigs and producing his own records for over 25 years as a bandleader.
- He stopped using organists on the road in 1986 and hired pianist Stan Hope, who has been with him ever since, marking a significant shift in his musical approach.
