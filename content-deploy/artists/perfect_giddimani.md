## Biography
Perfect Giddimani, born Greg Rose on March 26, 1980, in Bamboo, St. Ann Parish, Jamaica, is a celebrated reggae singer, songwriter, and producer known for his conscious lyrics and energetic stage presence. Raised in a musically rich environment—his mother sang in church and his grandfather led a banjo band—Perfect was immersed in music from an early age. His father, who repaired jukeboxes, exposed him to a wide array of genres, but reggae became his passion, deeply influenced by the culture and sound of his homeland.

Perfect began his musical journey performing as 'Little Ninja' before adopting the name 'Mr. Perfect' and eventually 'Perfect Giddimani,' a moniker reflecting his perfectionist approach to music. He started deejaying on the local Trend Setter sound system and recorded his first dubplates there. After high school, he moved to Kingston to further develop his craft, performing in clubs and recording at top studios. His breakthrough came with the 2005 hit 'Hand Cart Bwoy,' which resonated with audiences for its social commentary and quickly became a reggae anthem. Over the years, he has released numerous albums, including 'Giddimani' (2006), 'Born Dead With Life' (2008), and 'Live My Life Again' (2017), the latter debuting at #1 on the Billboard Reggae Albums chart. Perfect Giddimani is also the founder and CEO of Giddimani Records, contributing to the global spread of roots reggae and mentoring emerging artists.
