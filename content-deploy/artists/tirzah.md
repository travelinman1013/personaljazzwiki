## Biography
Tirzah, a British singer-songwriter known for her alternative R&B sound, began her musical journey as a harpist after a local music teacher recommended she audition for a specialist music school. At age 13, she enrolled at The Purcell School for Young Musicians near Watford, Hertfordshire, where she studied classical harp amid an immersive environment of constant music-making. There, she met childhood friend and future collaborator Mica Levi (also known as Micachu), with whom she started experimenting by writing goofy songs on guitar and later using the school's music tech room for beats and vocals, marking the shift from classical training to electronic and experimental pop.[1][2][3]

After falling out of love with harp lessons and classical music, Tirzah pursued art and textiles at university, working as a print designer in the fashion industry while continuing to create music casually with Levi. Their partnership gained traction in 2012 when they spontaneously recorded 'I'm Not Dancing' before one of Levi's DJ sets at Boiler Room, leading to a release on Greco-Roman label and Tirzah's emergence in the UK DIY pop scene. She released her debut album *Devotion* in 2018, a collage of love songs spanning a decade of writing, which received universal acclaim for its intimate, off-kilter electronic production. Following its success, she quit her day job, toured, and recorded her second album *Colourgrade* (2021) amid motherhood, exploring themes of family and simple pleasures with dark, experimental sounds.[2][3][4]

Tirzah's style blends meditative, unorthodox pop with soft-focus intimacy, evolving from harp roots through dance and electronic influences, often described as a 'natural progression' curated collaboratively. She views her work as a team effort rather than solo, emphasizing ongoing evolution in her music while balancing life as a mother and partner.[2][4]

## Fun Facts
- Tirzah originally trained on a Celtic harp loaned from a local music trust but later regretted not embracing jazz harpists like Dorothy Ashby and Alice Coltrane due to unenjoyable classical lessons.[3]
- Her breakout track 'I'm Not Dancing' was recorded last-minute as a time-passer before Mica Levi's 2012 Boiler Room DJ set and unexpectedly launched her career.[3]
- She describes her creative process with Mica Levi as 'half hang, half music making,' often sifting through improvisations to curate songs rather than composing traditionally.[2][4]
- Tirzah has two young children and recorded *Colourgrade* while balancing motherhood, quitting her print design job only after *Devotion*'s success.[3]
