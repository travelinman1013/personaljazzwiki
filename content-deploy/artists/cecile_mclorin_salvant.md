## Biography
Cécile McLorin Salvant, born August 28, 1989, in Miami, Florida, to a French mother and Haitian father, grew up in a bilingual household exposed to diverse music through her parents' record collection. She began classical piano at age 5, sang in a children's choir at 8, and started classical voice lessons as a teenager, initially focusing on classical music and Broadway before transitioning to jazz at the Darius Milhaud Conservatory in Aix-en-Provence in 2007. She earned a bachelor's in French law from Université Pierre-Mendès-France in Grenoble while studying baroque music and jazz, later attending The New School for composition and music theory.[1][3]

Her career launched in 2010 with her debut album *Cécile & the Jean-François Bonnel Paris Quintet* and a surprise win at the Thelonious Monk International Jazz Competition at age 21, securing a contract with Mack Avenue Records. She released breakthrough albums like *WomanChild* (2013, Grammy-nominated), *For One to Love* (2015, Grammy winner), *Dreams and Daggers* (2017, Grammy winner), and *The Window* (2018, Grammy winner), blending jazz standards, originals, and songs in English, French, Occitan, and Haitian Kreyòl. Recent works include *Mélusine* (2023), *Ghost Song* (2022), and *Oh Snap* (2025) on Nonesuch Records. Her style fuses jazz, blues, folk, musical theater, cabaret, and vaudeville, drawing from historical roots while composing her own material.[1][2][3]

Celebrated as one of the top jazz vocalists of her generation, Salvant has topped *DownBeat* polls, received a MacArthur Genius Grant (2020), Doris Duke Artist Award, and Glenn Gould Protégé Prize (2019). Wynton Marsalis called her a once-in-a-generation talent; she performs globally at venues like Village Vanguard and Newport Jazz Festival, expanding jazz's narrative possibilities.[1][4]
