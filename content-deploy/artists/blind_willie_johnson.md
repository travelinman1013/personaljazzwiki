## Biography
Blind Willie Johnson (January 25, 1897 – September 18, 1945) was an American gospel blues singer, guitarist, and evangelist, renowned for his powerful, raspy voice and masterful slide guitar technique. Born in a small town south of Waco, Texas, Johnson's early life was marked by hardship: his mother died when he was young, and he was blinded at age seven in a domestic accident involving lye water. Raised in a deeply religious household, Johnson was immersed in church music and began playing a homemade cigar box guitar as a child, developing a profound spiritual and musical foundation that would shape his artistry.[1][4][5]

Johnson began his career as a street performer and preacher, captivating audiences with his unique fusion of gospel themes and blues musicality. Between 1927 and 1930, he recorded thirty tracks for Columbia Records, including classics such as 'Dark Was the Night, Cold Was the Ground,' 'Jesus Make Up My Dying Bed,' and 'It's Nobody's Fault but Mine.' Despite the commercial success of his records, Johnson lived in poverty, continuing to perform on the streets and lead a House of Prayer in Beaumont, Texas, until his death in 1945. His music, characterized by a blend of sacred lyrics and blues sensibility, left an indelible mark on American music and has influenced generations of artists across genres.[1][3][4]

A revival of interest in Johnson's work began in the 1960s, particularly after his inclusion in Harry Smith's 'Anthology of American Folk Music.' His haunting slide guitar on 'Dark Was the Night, Cold Was the Ground' was selected for the Voyager Golden Record as a representation of humanity's musical heritage. Today, Johnson is celebrated as one of the most influential figures in gospel blues, with his recordings preserved in numerous compilations and his legacy honored by historical markers and music halls of fame.[1][3][5]
