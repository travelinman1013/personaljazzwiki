## Biography
Edmond Blainey Hall (May 15, 1901 – February 11, 1967) was an American jazz clarinetist and bandleader best known for his powerful, blues-suffused sound and his 1941 classic “Profoundly Blue.”[1][2][3][5][6] Born in Reserve, Louisiana, about forty miles west of New Orleans, he grew up in a deeply musical family—his father was a brass band leader and several brothers, including trumpeter/clarinetist Herbert Hall, also became professional musicians—so he was surrounded by the Gulf Coast and New Orleans brass band and early jazz traditions from childhood.[1][2][7] After working manual labor jobs, he moved to New Orleans in 1919 and began playing professionally with local groups, notably working with legendary but unrecorded cornetist Buddy Petit in the early 1920s, then spending time in Pensacola, Florida, with bands led by Lee Collins, Mack Thomas, the Pensacola Jazzers, and Alonzo Ross’ DeLuxe Syncopators, with whom he made his recording debut in 1927, playing clarinet and several saxophones.[2][3]

In 1928 Hall relocated to New York City, where he spent 1929–1935 in the Claude Hopkins Orchestra, a leading early swing band, mostly as a section reed player on alto and baritone sax as well as clarinet.[1][2][3] Only in the mid‑1930s did he fully assert himself as a distinctive solo voice: joining Billy Hicks’ Sizzling Six in 1936, he dropped the saxophones to become a full‑time clarinetist, and late‑1930s records with Hicks, Frankie Newton’s Uptown Serenaders, Henry “Red” Allen, and singers such as Billie Holiday and Mildred Bailey announced his arrival as a major soloist.[2][3] His landmark 1941 Blue Note date with Meade Lux Lewis, Charlie Christian, and Israel Crosby—issued as the Celeste Quartet—produced “Profoundly Blue,” often cited as a pre‑war chamber jazz masterpiece and a signature example of his biting, vocal-like tone and driving swing.[2][3][4][5] Through the 1940s he was in great demand, recording prolifically for labels like Commodore and Blue Note, fronting his own groups at New York’s Café Society, appearing on Eddie Condon’s Town Hall concerts and radio broadcasts, and working with Louis Armstrong, for whom he assembled a small group for a pivotal 1947 Carnegie Hall concert that helped spur Armstrong’s move from big band to the All‑Stars format.[1][2][3]

Hall’s later career balanced bandleading, star sideman work, and important regional influence. In 1948 he moved to Boston, first replacing Bob Wilber at the Savoy Café and soon leading the celebrated Edmond Hall All‑Stars there, while collaborating with pianist and impresario George Wein to organize local jazz concerts that helped build the city’s modern festival culture.[1][2][3] During the 1950s he was a nightly fixture at Eddie Condon’s club in New York and also played with Ralph Sutton, Mel Powell, Jack Teagarden, and Louis Armstrong’s All‑Stars, often as the only Black musician onstage and consistently crossing racial barriers on the strength of his unique sound.[1][2] In 1960 Hall and his wife Winnie briefly moved to Ghana in hopes of founding a music school, but soon returned to New York, after which he toured and recorded in Europe (including with British trombonist-bandleader Chris Barber) and Japan, and remained active with the Newport Jazz Festival All Stars into the mid‑1960s.[1][2] Settling in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1964, he became a beloved presence in New England clubs and festivals and mentored younger players before his death there in 1967; his robust yet edgy clarinet style, rooted in New Orleans but rhythmically advanced and harmonically modern, has since been regarded as a crucial bridge between traditional jazz, swing, and later revival movements.[1][2][4]

## Fun Facts
- Hall did not fully establish his own distinctive clarinet voice on record until around 1937, when he was almost 36 years old—much later than many peers—after more than a decade as a mostly anonymous section reed player.[2]
- His first session as a leader paired his clarinet with Meade Lux Lewis on celeste and Charlie Christian on acoustic guitar—the latter’s only known recordings on acoustic rather than electric guitar—producing the cult favorite “Profoundly Blue.”[2][3][4]
- During much of his 1950–1955 residency at Eddie Condon’s club in New York, Hall was often the only Black musician on the bandstand, regularly crossing racial lines in the still-segregated jazz world through sheer musical demand for his sound.[2]
- In 1960 Hall and his wife moved to Ghana intending to open a music school; although the project failed and they returned to New York, this episode underscores his interest in music education and transatlantic cultural exchange well before such ventures were common among U.S. jazz artists.[1][2]

- [[eddie_condon|Eddie Condon]] - Guitarist and impresario whose club and concerts featured Hall as a key front‑line clarinetist; Hall initially subbed for Pee Wee Russell but became a regular star in Condon’s Chicago‑style Dixieland settings.
