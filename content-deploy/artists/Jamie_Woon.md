## Biography
Jamie Woon is a British singer, songwriter, and producer known for his innovative blend of electronic, R&B, soul, and folk influences. Born on March 29, 1983, in New Malden, Greater London, he grew up in a musically rich environment—his mother, Mae McKenna, is a Celtic folk singer and backing vocalist, and his uncles played in the Sensational Alex Harvey Band.

Woon's music has been credited with paving the way for a new wave of UK soul and electronic artists.
