## Biography
Lenny Williams, born Leonard Charles Williams on February 6, 1945, in Little Rock, Arkansas, is a renowned American singer celebrated for his contributions to R&B and soul music. Williams relocated to Oakland, California, at a young age, where his musical journey began with trumpet lessons in elementary school and singing in gospel choirs across the Bay Area. His early exposure to gospel and artists like Sam Cooke shaped his emotive vocal style, which would become his hallmark[1][2][3][4][6].

Williams' professional career took off after winning local talent contests and signing with Fantasy Records, where he recorded singles such as "Lisa's Gone" and "Feelin Blue" (the latter written by John Fogerty of Creedence Clearwater Revival)[1][2][3][4]. His breakthrough came in 1972 when he joined Tower of Power as lead vocalist, contributing to three milestone albums—'Tower of Power,' 'Back to Oakland,' and 'Urban Renewal'—and delivering hits like "So Very Hard To Go" and "Don't Change Horses (In The Middle Of The Stream)"[1][2][3][5][6]. After leaving the band in 1975, Williams returned to solo work, signing with Motown and later ABC Records, where he scored numerous charted hits, most notably "'Cause I Love You," which became an enduring classic[3][7].

Williams' style, rooted in gospel and soul, is characterized by passionate, heartfelt delivery and a focus on themes of love and resilience. His influence extends into contemporary R&B and pop, with his vocal approach and songwriting inspiring a new generation of artists. Williams remains active in music, operating his own label and continuing to tour and record, solidifying his legacy as one of R&B’s most influential soul men[3][7].
