## Biography
The Gladiators are a legendary Jamaican roots reggae band formed in 1968 by Albert Griffiths, who grew up in poverty in Trench Town after being born in the rural parish of St. Elizabeth. The band's name was inspired by a bus passenger referencing the film 'Ben Hur,' symbolizing the struggle for freedom that resonated with Jamaica's Rasta community. Initially a vocal trio with Griffiths, David Webber, and Errol Grandison, the group quickly made a mark with their 1969 hit 'Hello Carol' for producer Coxsone Dodd, which topped the Jamaican charts and established their reputation locally.

Throughout the 1970s, The Gladiators became one of the most influential roots reggae groups, with Griffiths joined by Clinton Fearon and Gallimore Sutherland after the departure of the original members. Their sound, rooted in the struggles and spirit of Jamaica, was shaped by Griffiths' work as a session musician at Studio One, where he also backed artists like Burning Spear and Stranger Cole. The band's international breakthrough came with the 1976 release of 'Trenchtown Mix Up' on Virgin Records, featuring classics like 'Bongo Red' and 'Roots Natty.' Despite industry setbacks in the 1980s, The Gladiators continued to tour and record, maintaining their status as pillars of roots reggae. After Griffiths' retirement, his son Al Griffiths and later Droop Lion took over as frontmen, ensuring the band's legacy endures.

The Gladiators are celebrated for their authentic roots reggae style, blending soulful harmonies, conscious lyrics, and driving rhythms. Their influence extends across generations, and their music remains a testament to Jamaica's enduring cultural and social struggles.
