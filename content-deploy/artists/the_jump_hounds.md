## Quick Info

- **Spotify Popularity**: 0/100
- **Followers**: 113
- **Origin**: New Orleans, Louisiana, United States[2][3][4][5]

## Biography
The Jump Hounds is a New Orleans–based sextet dedicated to reviving and extending the tradition of mid‑century **jump blues** and **swing‑era rhythm and blues**, the high‑energy style that historically bridged big‑band swing and early rock ’n’ roll.[2][3][4] Emerging on the rich New Orleans club and festival circuit, the group built its identity around dance‑focused arrangements, tightly integrated horns, and a repertoire that channels the sound of 1940s–1950s small combos while remaining accessible to contemporary audiences.[2][3][4] Trumpeter and vocalist Adam Arredondo has been cited in regional press as a central member, helping bring the band to venues such as the Abita Opry after being heard at local events like the Abita Springs Busker Festival.[6]

Stylistically, The Jump Hounds emphasize the classic jump‑band lineup: a driving rhythm section supporting prominent horns and vocals in a style rooted in jazz harmony but oriented toward blues forms and backbeat rhythms.[2][3][4] Their sets typically feature material in the idiom of post‑war R&B—sometimes including originals such as the instrumental "Monday Night Jump," led on video by saxophonist Marty Peters—which showcases their focus on period‑authentic phrasing, riffs, and call‑and‑response horn writing.[7] Operating within New Orleans’ historically fertile jazz and R&B scene, the band contributes to the ongoing preservation of jump blues as a living dance music rather than a purely archival style, appearing on local stages and regional events that spotlight traditional and roots‑based American music.[4][5][6]

## Fun Facts
