## Biography
Johnny Dodds (April 12, 1892 – August 8, 1940) was an influential American jazz clarinetist and alto saxophonist, born in Waveland, Mississippi, and raised in the vibrant musical environment of New Orleans. Surrounded by a musically inclined family—his father and uncle were violinists, and his sister played melodeon—Dodds began singing in a family quartet before taking up the clarinet at age 17. He studied under renowned clarinetists Lorenzo Tio and Charlie McCurdy, which helped shape his distinctive, blues-infused style.

Dodds quickly became a key figure in the early jazz scene, performing with bands led by Frankie Duson, Kid Ory, and most notably Joe 'King' Oliver. He moved to Chicago in the early 1920s, joining Oliver's Creole Jazz Band and recording with them in 1923. Dodds's career flourished in Chicago, where he became a central figure in the jazz community, recording prolifically with Louis Armstrong's Hot Five and Hot Seven, Jelly Roll Morton's Red Hot Peppers, and under his own name with Johnny Dodds' Black Bottom Stompers. His expressive, bluesy clarinet playing was a hallmark of the classic New Orleans jazz sound and significantly influenced the development of jazz clarinet.

Despite his early success, Dodds's career was impacted by the Great Depression and later by ill health, leading to a decline in recording activity during the 1930s. He passed away in Chicago in 1940, but his legacy endures as one of the premier clarinetists of his era and a foundational architect of the Jazz Age. Dodds was posthumously inducted into the Jazz Hall of Fame and remains a touchstone for clarinetists and jazz historians.
