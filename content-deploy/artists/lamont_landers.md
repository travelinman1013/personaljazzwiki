## Biography
Lamont Landers is an American soul, R&B, and funk singer, guitarist, and songwriter, born and raised in Decatur, Alabama, a small North Alabama town where, in his words, “everybody knows everybody.”[1] Music was central to his upbringing: riding in the back of his father’s Chevrolet S‑10 Blazer, he absorbed Southern rock from bands like the Allman Brothers and Lynyrd Skynyrd, while at home his mother played classic soul artists such as Al Green, Sly & The Family Stone, Ray Charles, and Marvin Gaye.[1] Amid his parents’ divorce he turned to music as a refuge, teaching himself guitar in his mid‑teens and later discovering his singing voice in his early twenties when he unexpectedly stepped up to sing after his college band’s lead vocalist quit.[1][2]

Landers spent years honing his craft in his bedroom, listening repeatedly to records by Stevie Wonder, Al Green, Sly & The Family Stone, Ray Charles, and others, before forming the Lamont Landers Band, a four‑piece group that became a staple in college towns across the U.S. Southeast.[2] His breakthrough came around age 22, when a candid video filmed by his sister of him performing Ray Charles’ “Hit the Road Jack” went viral online, earning hundreds of thousands of views overnight and rapidly expanding his audience.[1][2] He went on to appear on national television, including “America’s Got Talent” Season 14 and “Showtime at the Apollo,” bringing his blend of retro‑soul vocals, tight funk grooves, and blues‑rooted guitar to wider audiences.[1][2][5]

Artistically, Landers draws heavily from classic soul, Southern rock, and vintage R&B, combining a soaring, emotionally charged voice with gritty guitar tone and grooves influenced by Motown, funk, and church‑inflected organ sounds.[1][2] After building a following through live shows, viral covers, and TikTok performances, he attracted the attention of GRAMMY‑winning producer Dave Cobb when Questlove reposted Landers’ cover of the Spinners’ “Rubber Band Man.”[1] Cobb invited him to record at his Savannah, Georgia studio, leading to Landers signing with Cobb’s Republic Records imprint, Lucile, and cutting a body of original material that includes socially aware tracks like “America,” the post‑breakup soul cut “Whole Lot of Love to Give,” the playful “Oh Shit! (I’m in Love),” and the deeply personal “I Have Always Loved You,” dedicated to his daughter.[1] While still in the early stages of his recording career, Landers has already established a reputation as a compelling live performer and modern torchbearer of retro soul emerging from the American South.[1][2][3]

## Fun Facts
- A casual home video of Landers performing Ray Charles’ “Hit the Road Jack,” filmed by his sister, went viral with over 400,000 views overnight after being shared on Reddit, effectively launching his professional career.[2]
- Before he ever thought of himself as a singer, Landers primarily saw himself as a guitarist; he only discovered his vocal ability in his early twenties when he stepped up to sing after his college band’s lead singer quit.[1][2]
- Questlove’s repost of Landers’ cover of the Spinners’ “Rubber Band Man” on social media directly led to GRAMMY-winning producer Dave Cobb hearing his work and inviting him to record, a connection that resulted in his signing to Cobb’s Lucile imprint at Republic Records.[1]
- One of Landers’ most personal recorded songs, “I Have Always Loved You,” is written as a heartfelt letter to his daughter, expressing what he describes as the overwhelming depth of feeling he has as a father.[1]
