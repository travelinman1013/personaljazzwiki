## Biography
David Peel (born David Michael Rosario on August 3, 1942, in Brooklyn, New York; died April 6, 2017) was a New York City-based musician and countercultural activist who emerged as a pioneering figure in proto-punk and street rock during the late 1960s. Beginning his career as a street busker in Greenwich Village and Washington Square Park during the mid-1960s, Peel developed a raw, acoustic "street rock" style that addressed marijuana legalization, police brutality, and anti-war sentiment. His unfiltered approach to songwriting and performance made him a distinctive voice in the underground music scene, where he performed alongside folk musicians and hippies before transitioning to electric rock.

Peel's most significant commercial period came through his association with Elektra Records, where his band The Lower East Side released two influential albums: "Have a Marijuana" (1968), recorded live on the streets of New York, and "The American Revolution" (1970). These records showcased his proto-punk aesthetic and nihilistic worldview, directly influencing the emerging New York punk movement of the mid-1970s. His brief but high-profile collaboration with John Lennon and Yoko Ono resulted in his signing to Apple Records in 1972 and the release of "The Pope Smokes Dope," which, despite being largely unavailable in record stores, cemented his place in counterculture history. Following his time in the mainstream, Peel maintained an independent career, founding his own Orange Records label and continuing to record prolifically throughout his life, while also remaining an active participant in social movements including Occupy Wall Street in 2011.
