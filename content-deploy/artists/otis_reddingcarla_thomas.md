## Biography
Carla Thomas, born Carla Venita Thomas on December 21, 1942, in Memphis, Tennessee, emerged as a pivotal figure in soul music, often hailed as the Queen of Memphis Soul. The daughter of entertainer Rufus Thomas, she began performing young, joining the Teen Towns group at age 10 despite not being in high school, and sang country-influenced songs like Brenda Lee's on local radio. Her professional breakthrough came in 1960 at age 17 with the duet 'Cause I Love You' alongside her father Rufus, recorded at Satellite Records (later Stax), which drew Atlantic Records' attention and launched her solo career with the self-written hit 'Gee Whiz (Look at His Eyes),' reaching Top 10 on the pop chart while she attended Hamilton High School.[2][1][5]

Thomas became Stax Records' most successful female artist in the 1960s, releasing full-length albums—the only woman on the label to do so—and charting over 20 times with hits like 'B-A-B-Y' (1966, #14 pop) and 'Let Me Be Good to You.' Her defining collaboration was the 1967 duet album King & Queen with Otis Redding, featuring smashes like 'Tramp' (#26 pop) and 'Knock on Wood,' blending her sophisticated vocals with his raw energy to propel Stax's Memphis Sound globally, including the 1967 Stax/Volt European tour. She earned two Grammy nominations that year and remained a cornerstone of Southern soul.[1][2][4][6]

Post-1960s, Thomas received the 1993 Rhythm & Blues Foundation Pioneer Award alongside James Brown and Solomon Burke, appeared in the 2003 documentary Only the Strong Survive, and featured on Valerie June's 2021 Grammy-nominated 'Call Me a Fool.' Her work solidified Memphis and Stax as soul music originators, paving the way for artists like Aretha Franklin and Gladys Knight, with a legacy of 12 studio albums and enduring international appeal.[1][2][8]
