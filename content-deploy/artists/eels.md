## Biography
Mark Oliver Everett, known professionally as E, was born on April 10, 1963, in the United States. The son of a quantum physicist father with whom he shared little warmth, Everett showed early interest in music influenced by his sister's records rather than academics like physics or math. He began writing songs as a young child, including one at age 10 about his first girlfriend on his mother's upright piano, and pursued music seriously thereafter, releasing solo work before forming Eels in Los Angeles in 1995.[1][2][3][4][6]
