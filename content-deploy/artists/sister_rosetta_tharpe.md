## Biography
Sister Rosetta Tharpe, born Rosie Etta Atkins (also known as Rosetta Nubin) on March 20, 1915, in Cotton Plant, Arkansas, was a pioneering American singer, guitarist, and songwriter whose innovative blend of gospel, blues, and jazz laid the groundwork for rock and roll. Raised in a deeply religious household by her mother, Katie Bell Nubin, a singer and evangelist, Tharpe began performing in church at the age of four and soon toured the South with her mother as part of an evangelist troupe. Their move to Chicago in the 1920s exposed Tharpe to the vibrant jazz and blues scenes, influences she would later weave into her gospel performances[1][2][5].

By the late 1930s, Tharpe had moved to New York City, where her electrifying guitar playing and charismatic stage presence brought gospel music into nightclubs and concert halls, breaking barriers for both women and Black artists. Her recordings for Decca Records, including "Rock Me" and "This Train," showcased her unique style—combining spiritual lyrics with rhythmic, jazz-inflected guitar work. Tharpe's collaborations with artists like Marie Knight and her willingness to cross musical boundaries made her a national sensation. Despite facing criticism from some in the gospel community for her forays into secular music, she remained a prolific performer, touring extensively in the U.S. and Europe until her death in 1973[1][2][3].

Tharpe's legacy is profound: she is widely recognized as a foundational figure in the development of rock and roll, directly influencing artists such as Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Elvis Presley, and Johnny Cash. Her induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2018 cemented her status as a trailblazer whose genre-defying artistry continues to inspire generations of musicians[2][4][6].

## Fun Facts
- Tharpe was one of the first artists to use heavy distortion on her electric guitar, foreshadowing the sound of rock and roll decades before it became mainstream[4].
- Her third wedding, to manager Russell Morrison in 1951, was held in a baseball stadium and attended by 25,000 paying fans, doubling as a concert[1][3].
- She recorded what is believed to be the first interracial duet in the U.S. with country singer Red Foley[1].
- Despite her public marriages to men, it is widely accepted that Tharpe also had relationships with women, making her an important figure in LGBTQ+ music history[3].
