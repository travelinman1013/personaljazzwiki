## Biography
Tres Muchachos & Compañeros is a Russian band formed in 1999 in St. Petersburg by three friends: Efremenko Sergey (Tres, vocals), Denis Rachkov (guitar), and Kirill Oskin (bass). Specializing in **son cubano** and **cha cha cha**, the group emerged from the vibrant Latin music scene in Russia, blending traditional Cuban rhythms with their unique interpretations.[1][6]

The band's career gained international exposure through their contribution to Putumayo World Music's 2006 compilation album *Rumba, Mambo, Cha Cha Chá*, where they covered Jimmy Bosch’s “Pa’ Mantener Tradición” (To Maintain Tradition). This track highlighted their commitment to preserving classic Latin dance styles like rumba, mambo, and cha cha chá, adapted with a retro-flavored energy. Active primarily in the 2000s, they maintained a niche popularity, reflected in their Spotify popularity score of 11, while performing and recording music rooted in Cuban traditions.[1][6]

Though detailed accounts of their full discography or later activities are limited, Tres Muchachos & Compañeros represent Russia's unexpected embrace of Afro-Cuban genres, contributing to the global appeal of these timeless styles through live performances and recordings.[1][6]
