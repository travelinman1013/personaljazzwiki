## Biography
Almir Guineto (born Almir de Souza Serra, July 12, 1946 – May 5, 2017) was a pioneering Brazilian sambista, singer, songwriter, and instrumentalist, celebrated as one of the founding fathers of the pagode style of samba. Raised in the Salgueiro hills of Rio de Janeiro in a family deeply rooted in samba, Guineto developed his musical talents early and became an influential figure in the genre from the 1970s onward. He began his career as a member of Os Originais do Samba, a group instrumental in shaping the pagode sound, and later became a founding member of the legendary Fundo de Quintal, further popularizing pagode through the 1980s and 1990s.

Guineto is widely recognized for introducing the banjo to samba, modifying it with nylon strings to create a distinctive, percussive sound that became a hallmark of his music and the pagode movement. As both a performer and songwriter, he achieved national acclaim with hits like "Conselho," "Saco Cheio," and "Caxambú," and his compositions were recorded by major artists such as Beth Carvalho and Zeca Pagodinho. Guineto's music resonated with everyday Brazilians, blending lyrical storytelling with infectious rhythms, and his powerful, raucous voice became his trademark. Over his career, he released more than a dozen albums, including the influential "O Suburbano" (1981) and "Almir Guineto" (1986).

Beyond his solo work, Guineto served as director of the Salgueiro samba school and was a frequent presence at the Cacique de Ramos samba gatherings, helping to foster a vibrant community of musicians. His legacy endures as a cornerstone of modern samba and pagode, with his innovations and popular songs continuing to inspire new generations of Brazilian artists.
