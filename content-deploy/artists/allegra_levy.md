## Biography
Allegra Levy is a critically acclaimed American jazz vocalist, songwriter, and composer, known for her sophisticated original songs and richly expressive contralto voice. Born and raised in West Hartford, Connecticut—a town celebrated for its strong jazz education programs—Levy was immersed in music from an early age, influenced by her parents' love of folk and pop, and later by jazz legends such as Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughan, and Dianne Reeves. She honed her craft at the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston, where she earned a degree in Jazz Vocal Performance and was deeply shaped by the institution's culture of composition and innovation.

After moving to New York, Levy quickly established herself on the city's vibrant jazz scene, performing at iconic venues like the Jazz Standard, Blue Note, Birdland Theater, and the Bitter End. Her debut album, released in 2014, was praised by The New York Times as 'fresh, exotic, and far beyond the ordinary.' She has since released several albums on the SteepleChase label, including 'Looking at the Moon' and 'Lose My Number: Allegra Levy Sings John McNeil,' the latter featuring her own lyrics set to the music of renowned trumpeter John McNeil. Levy's work is characterized by harmonically adventurous yet accessible originals, blending the Great American Songbook tradition with modern sensibilities and a touch of lyrical wit.

Levy's career is marked by both critical recognition and a commitment to musical outreach. She has been named one of DownBeat Magazine's Top 10 Rising Star Jazz Vocalists and has won multiple songwriting awards, including the John Lennon Songwriting Competition and the Great American Song Contest. In recent years, she has expanded her repertoire to include jazz-infused children's music, earning acclaim for her ability to make jazz accessible to younger audiences. Levy also serves in a leadership role with the Women in Jazz Organization, advocating for greater visibility and equity in the jazz community.
