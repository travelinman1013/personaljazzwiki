## Biography
Brenda Lee, born Brenda Mae Tarpley on December 11, 1944, in Atlanta, Georgia, emerged as one of the most dynamic and versatile vocalists in American music. Raised in modest circumstances in Conyers and Lithonia, Georgia, Lee began singing almost as soon as she could talk, captivating local audiences from the age of five. After the tragic death of her father when she was just seven, Lee became the primary breadwinner for her family, performing regularly on local radio and television and winning talent contests with her powerful voice that belied her small stature.

Lee's national breakthrough came in 1956 when, at age eleven, she performed Hank Williams’s “Jambalaya” onstage with country star Red Foley, who signed her as a regular on his ABC-TV program 'Ozark Jubilee.' Shortly after, she secured a contract with Decca Records, and by age twelve, she had her first Billboard hit. Throughout the late 1950s and 1960s, Lee became an international sensation, known for her energetic rockabilly, pop, and country recordings. Her signature song, 'Rockin’ Around the Christmas Tree,' became a perennial holiday classic. Nicknamed 'Little Miss Dynamite,' Lee’s career spanned child stardom, teen idol status, and later, country music acclaim.

Lee’s musical style is marked by her expressive, emotionally charged vocals, blending elements of rock and roll, country, and pop. She is celebrated as a pioneer of early rock and roll and remains one of the few artists inducted into both the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Country Music Hall of Fame. Her enduring influence is evident in the generations of artists who cite her as an inspiration.
