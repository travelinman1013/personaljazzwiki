## Biography
Billy Iuso is a New York native whose early musical journey began in the vibrant Wetlands scene of the early 1990s, where he formed Brides of Jesus, a band known for its funky, psychedelic, guitar-driven jam sound. Brides of Jesus quickly gained traction, sharing bills with notable acts such as Blues Traveler, Widespread Panic, and Dave Matthews Band, and became a staple among the jam band community. Iuso's exposure to the music of Little Feat led him to the legendary New Orleans funk group The Meters, and soon he was opening for the Funky Meters across the country. Encouraged by George Porter Jr. and Art Neville, Iuso relocated to New Orleans in 1996, immersing himself in the city's rich musical culture and establishing lifelong connections with its artists.[1][2][3][4][5]

After Brides of Jesus disbanded in 2001, Iuso took a brief hiatus from performing, working as a tour manager for The Meters, Neville Brothers, and George Porter Jr., which deepened his understanding of the music business. Missing the stage, he formed Billy Iuso & the Restless Natives in 2002, releasing a prolific catalog of albums that received airplay on New Orleans' WWOZ Radio. His music, rooted in funk, rock, and jam traditions, is celebrated for its lyrical depth and dynamic live performances. Over the past two decades, Iuso has played hundreds of venues and festivals across the US, Europe, and the Caribbean, including regular appearances at Tipitina’s and the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival.[1][2][3][4]

In recent years, Iuso streamlined his act, performing simply as "Billy Iuso" and continuing to collaborate with top-tier New Orleans musicians. His 2023 album "52 hz" reflects both his enduring creativity and adaptability, featuring songs inspired by the pandemic and revisiting material from his youth. Iuso remains a prominent figure in the New Orleans music scene, known for his genre-blending style, collaborative spirit, and influence on the next generation of musicians.[1][3][4]
