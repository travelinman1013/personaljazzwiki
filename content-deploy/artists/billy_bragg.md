## Biography
Stephen William Bragg, known as Billy Bragg, was born on December 20, 1957, in Barking, Essex, England. Educated at Barking Abbey Comprehensive School, he left in 1974 with one O-level and worked as a clerk and bank messenger before forming the punk rock band Riff Raff in 1977 with friends, including Wiggy. The band released indie singles but split in 1980 after limited success. Disillusioned, Bragg briefly joined the British Army in 1981, buying himself out after basic training to pursue music solo, initially under the pseudonym Spy vs Spy. His debut album, *Life’s a Riot with Spy vs Spy* (1984), entered the UK Top 40, featuring hits like 'A New England' covered by Kirsty MacColl.[1][2][3]
