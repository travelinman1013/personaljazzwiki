## Biography
Nathaniel Adams Coles, known professionally as Nat King Cole, was born on March 17, 1919, in Montgomery, Alabama. Raised in Chicago, Cole was exposed to music early through his mother, a church organist, and began formal piano lessons at age 12. By his teens, he was performing in jazz clubs and eventually formed the King Cole Trio in the late 1930s, pioneering a unique piano-guitar-bass format that influenced the development of small jazz ensembles.[2][6] The trio's blend of jazz and vocal harmonies quickly gained popularity, and their breakthrough came with the hit 'Straighten Up and Fly Right' in 1943.[5][6]

Cole's velvety baritone and sophisticated style propelled him from jazz pianist to international pop star. Signing with Capitol Records in 1942, he recorded a string of hits including 'Sweet Lorraine,' 'Route 66,' 'Nature Boy,' 'Mona Lisa,' and 'Unforgettable.'[1][4][5] His crossover appeal made him one of the first African American artists to achieve mainstream success, and in 1956, he became the first African American to host a national television show, breaking significant racial barriers in the entertainment industry.[3][7] Cole's career spanned radio, film, and television, and he remained a beloved figure until his untimely death from lung cancer in 1965.[2][3]

Nat King Cole's legacy endures as a foundational figure in vocal jazz and pop music. His influence is evident in the work of countless artists who followed, and his recordings remain standards in American music. Cole received numerous accolades, including a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award and induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as an 'Early Influence.'[2][4] His pioneering role in breaking down racial barriers and his timeless musical contributions continue to inspire generations.
