## Biography
George Henry Jackson (March 12, 1945 – April 14, 2013) was a prolific American songwriter and soul singer, renowned for his contributions to blues, rhythm and blues, rock and roll, and southern soul. Born in Indianola, Mississippi, Jackson moved to Greenville at age five and was deeply influenced by gospel music, singing in church and absorbing the styles of groups like the Five Blind Boys of Mississippi and Sam Cooke’s Soul Stirrers. He began writing songs as a teenager and, after an early introduction to Ike Turner, recorded his first single in New Orleans, though it failed to chart.

Jackson’s career blossomed in Memphis, where he helped form The Ovations and wrote their 1965 hit "It's Wonderful To Be in Love." He also wrote for Goldwax artists such as Spencer Wiggins and James Carr, and recorded with Dan Greer as George and Greer. His versatile tenor, shaped by gospel and soul influences, led to a steady output of singles across various labels, though he never achieved major fame as a performer. Jackson’s true legacy lies in his songwriting: at FAME Studios in Muscle Shoals, Alabama, he penned hits for Clarence Carter, Wilson Pickett, and Candi Staton, among others. Notably, he wrote "One Bad Apple" for The Osmonds and co-wrote "Old Time Rock and Roll," which became a signature hit for Bob Seger.

Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Jackson continued to write for leading soul and blues artists, including Johnnie Taylor, Bobby Bland, Latimore, Denise LaSalle, and Z.Z. Hill. He founded his own publishing company, Happy Hooker Music, and joined Malaco Records as a staff songwriter. Jackson’s work is celebrated for its emotional depth, melodic strength, and enduring influence on the soul genre, cementing his reputation as one of the unsung architects of American soul music.
