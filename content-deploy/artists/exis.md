## Biography
Exists is a prominent Malaysian pop rock band that originated in Johor Bahru in 1991, initially known as Exist. The founding lineup included vocalist Muhammad Ali 'Mamat' Kamarudin, guitarists Azhrul 'Along' Nasir and Shah Nizam Abdul 'Shah' Halim, keyboardist Mohd Faizal 'Ajai' Maas, bassist Musa 'Musrad' Radhi, and drummer Saharudin 'Ujang' Saniman. Their breakthrough came with the heartfelt single 'Untukmu Ibu' in 1991, which quickly established them as a significant force in the Malaysian music scene. Their debut self-titled album was released the same year, marking the beginning of a prolific recording career.

Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, Exists released a series of successful albums, including 'Anugerah' (1993), 'Diammu Gunung Berapi' (1995), and 'Ada' (2001), evolving their sound from rock kapak (a local rock subgenre) to incorporate elements of pop and balladry. The band underwent several lineup changes, most notably with the departure of original vocalist Mamat in 1994 and the arrival of Mohd Rohaizad Mohd 'Ezad' Lazim. After a brief period as Exist, they added an 's' to their name in 1997. Despite periods of hiatus and further changes, Exists has remained influential, reuniting for major concerts and continuing to draw large audiences well into the 2020s.

Musically, Exists is known for their emotive melodies, powerful vocals, and a style that bridges classic Malay pop and contemporary rock. Their legacy is cemented by their enduring popularity, cross-generational appeal, and significant contributions to the development of Malaysian pop and rock music.
