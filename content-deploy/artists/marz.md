## Biography
Marz, born Zlatko Bobby Hukic and also known as Bobby Marz, is a Croatian-born rapper, singer, and guitarist who built his career out of Chicago, Illinois.[2][7] He immigrated from Croatia as a child and grew up in Chicago, where an early love of heavy metal gradually expanded into a deep interest in hip‑hop.[1][2] Determined to break into the music business, he persistently pursued an internship at Chicago Trax, a prominent recording studio, eventually landing a job as a tech and assistant engineer despite having no formal experience.[1][2][5] There he worked sessions for high‑profile acts including Peter Gabriel and industrial metal band Ministry, quietly developing both his engineering skills and his own solo material.[2][5]

His big break came in the mid‑1990s when Ministry frontman Al Jourgensen heard him working at Chicago Trax and invited him to contribute guitar and engineering to the band’s 1996 album *Filth Pig*, which became Ministry’s highest‑charting release.[1][2] Marz soon became a full‑time member of Ministry, touring internationally and remaining with the group through the recording of their 1999 album *Dark Side of the Spoon* before stepping away, later returning for one more tour.[1][2] Around 2000 he shifted toward a hybrid of industrial, metal, and rap, fronting his own band Marz and signing with E‑Magine Records, which released his debut album *Lung Fu Mo She*, described as a “toxic blend of industrial drumming and guitars” with aggressive rap vocals and themes of self‑empowerment.[2] Tracks from the album appeared in mainstream outlets such as MTV’s *The Real World*, the *WWF Tough Enough 2* soundtrack, and advertising for the film *Catwoman*, giving him broad exposure beyond the underground.[2]

In the early 2000s Marz became closely associated with the Insane Clown Posse and their Juggalo fanbase, touring on ICP’s “Bizaar Bizzar” tour with his band and later contributing to the supergroup Dark Lotus, whose lyrics explored dark, occult‑themed imagery.[1][2] He also signed with Korn’s label Elementree, toured on Korn’s “Pop Sux” tour, and recorded collaborations with Jonathan Davis and producer Swizz Beatz, further cementing his role as a crossover figure between metal, industrial, and hip‑hop.[2][8] Over the next several years he released a steady stream of projects, including *Gorilla Pimpin* (2003), *TGZ Nation: The Mixtape* (2004), *Against All Odds* (2005), and *Marz Presents: Grind Music The Movement* (2007), while also founding his own label, Billion Dollar Ballers.[2][7] Later interviews and Christian media profiles highlighted a sharp personal and spiritual turn, describing his past involvement with gangs and occult‑themed material and his subsequent conversion to Christianity, after which he redirected his music and public work toward faith‑based themes and outreach.[1] His legacy rests on his unusual path from Croatian immigrant and studio intern to industrial‑metal guitarist, Juggalo‑approved rapper, and eventually Christian hip‑hop artist, as well as on his distinctive fusion of heavy industrial sonics with aggressive rap delivery.

## Fun Facts
- Marz broke into the music industry by repeatedly calling a Chicago studio receptionist with a fake résumé until he was given an internship at Chicago Trax, beating out formally trained applicants through persistence alone.[1][2][5]
- His first major album credit, Ministry’s *Filth Pig*, was simultaneously the band’s highest‑charting release and a commercial disappointment due to its stylistic shift, giving him an early lesson in the gap between chart success and fan reception.[1][2]
- Songs from his debut album *Lung Fu Mo She* ended up in unexpected mainstream placements, including an ad campaign for the film *Catwoman*, MTV’s *The Real World*, and the *WWF Tough Enough 2* soundtrack, exposing his industrial‑rap hybrid to audiences far beyond metal and Juggalo circles.[2]
- After years of touring with acts like Ministry, ICP, and Korn and participating in occult‑themed projects such as Dark Lotus, Marz later became a Christian rapper and has spoken publicly about redirecting his life toward faith, street outreach, and prison ministry.[1]
