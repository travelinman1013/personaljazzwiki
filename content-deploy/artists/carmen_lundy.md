## Biography
Carmen Latretta Lundy, born November 1, 1954, in Miami, Florida, is a renowned American jazz singer, composer, arranger, and multi-instrumentalist celebrated for her original material and innovative musicianship. Raised in a musical family—her mother, Oveida, led the gospel group the Apostolic Singers of Miami—Lundy began piano lessons at age six and was immersed in gospel and jazz from an early age. By her early teens, she was performing in vocal groups and soon pursued formal music studies at the University of Miami, where she earned her Bachelor of Music degree and performed alongside future luminaries such as Pat Metheny and Bruce Hornsby[1][3][5][7][8].

Lundy launched her professional career in Miami’s vibrant club scene before moving to New York City in 1978, where she quickly established herself in the jazz world. Her debut solo album, 'Good Morning Kiss' (1985), reached No. 3 on Billboard’s Jazz Chart and marked the beginning of a prolific recording career spanning 16 albums and over 150 published songs. Lundy’s compositions have been recorded by artists like Kenny Barron, Ernie Watts, Terri Lyne Carrington, and Regina Carter. She has received multiple Grammy nominations, including for her 2023 album 'Fade To Black.' In addition to her vocal artistry, Lundy is also a composer, arranger, actress, painter, and filmmaker, with her documentary 'Nothing But The Blood' winning Best Music Documentary at the Downtown LA Film Festival in 2022[1][3][7].

Known for her sophisticated blend of vocal jazz, soul, and gospel influences, Lundy is recognized as one of the most respected jazz singers of her generation. She has contributed significantly to the evolution of vocal jazz, both as a performer and as a mentor, and continues to inspire new generations of musicians through her artistry and commitment to original music[1][4][5][6][7].
