## Biography
Bobby Patterson, born March 13, 1944 in Dallas, Texas, is a celebrated American soul and R&B singer, songwriter, producer, and multi-instrumentalist. He began performing at age 10, playing guitar and drums, and by his early teens had formed the Royal Rockers, a band that won local talent contests and earned him his first recording opportunity in California. Patterson's early career was shaped by his work with Abnak Records, where his 1962 single 'You Just Got To Understand' led to the creation of Jetstar Records, a soul division where he recorded and produced for much of the 1960s. 

Throughout the 1970s and beyond, Patterson became a respected figure in the Dallas soul scene, known for his gritty, hard-edged vocal style reminiscent of Wilson Pickett and Otis Redding, yet marked by his own distinct flair. He scored regional hits like 'T.C.B. Or T.Y.A.,' 'Let Them Talk,' and 'I'm In Love With You,' and later transitioned into production, working with artists such as Fontella Bass, Chuck Jackson, and Little Johnny Taylor. Patterson's songs were covered by blues and rock acts including Albert King and the Fabulous Thunderbirds, further cementing his influence. 

Patterson's career is notable for its breadth: he has been a singer, songwriter, producer, label owner, and radio DJ, notably hosting a popular soul show on Dallas's KKDA-AM from 1997 to 2012. His musical legacy is defined by his commitment to soul and blues traditions, his ability to adapt across decades, and his mentorship of younger musicians. Patterson's enduring presence was recognized with the Willie Dixon Lifetime Achievement Writers Award in 2022, and his recent recordings and performances continue to inspire new generations of soul fans.
