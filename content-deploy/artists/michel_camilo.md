## Biography
Michel Camilo is a Grammy Award-winning pianist and composer born on April 4, 1954, in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. Raised in a musical family, he began his formal music studies at age nine, initially on accordion before switching to piano. By sixteen, Camilo was the youngest member of the National Symphony Orchestra of the Dominican Republic, having studied for thirteen years at the National Conservatory and earning a Professorship in Music. In 1979, inspired by encouragement from visiting musicians, he moved to New York to study at Mannes College and The Juilliard School, immersing himself in the vibrant jazz scene.

Camilo's career rapidly ascended after his move to the United States. His composition "Why Not?" became a hit for the Manhattan Transfer and Paquito D'Rivera, and he joined D'Rivera's band for several years, touring internationally and recording two albums. Camilo debuted at Carnegie Hall in 1985 and released his self-titled album in 1988, which topped jazz charts for ten weeks. His musical style is distinguished by a high-powered virtuosity and a dynamic blend of Latin, jazz, and classical influences, often featuring Caribbean rhythms and jazz harmonies. He has recorded extensively in solo, duo, trio, sextet, big band, and orchestral formats, and has composed scores for Spanish-language films.

Camilo's legacy is marked by numerous accolades, including a Grammy, an Emmy, three Latin Grammy awards, and multiple honors from Spain and the Dominican Republic. He has served as jazz creative director for the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, musical director of the Heineken Jazz Festival, and held professorships at Berklee College of Music. Camilo continues to tour globally, lecture, and inspire new generations of musicians, recognized as one of the leading figures in Latin jazz and jazz fusion.
