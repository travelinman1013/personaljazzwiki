## Biography
Wayne Alpern is a New York City-based composer, arranger, and scholar known for his innovative integration of popular, jazz, and classical idioms[5][7][9]. Born in Detroit, Michigan, Alpern grew up immersed in the city’s Motown sound, which deeply influenced his musical sensibilities[1]. He pursued higher education at Oberlin College (where he majored in sociology but played rhythm guitar in a rock band called the Schades), the University of Michigan, Yale University, and the City University of New York, with additional studies at Harvard, Juilliard, Wesleyan, and the University of Pennsylvania[1][4]. His academic focus included Schenkerian analysis and 20th-century music, reflecting a rigorous theoretical foundation that informs his compositions[1].

Alpern’s career has spanned roles as a classical conductor, string player, arranger, and editor—notably serving as Steve Reich’s editor, a composer recognized for altering the course of musical history[1]. Alpern’s own music is characterized by a synthesis of tradition and innovation, often described as “new wine in old bottles”—blending classical forms with contemporary harmonies and improvisational elements, though his work is more precisely composed than freely improvised jazz[3]. His albums, such as Scarab (reimagining Beatles tunes), Skeleton (jazz standards for brass ensemble), and Modern Music (solo piano pieces), showcase his ability to recompose and rearrange existing material while maintaining a tonal, accessible aesthetic[1][2][3]. Alpern’s compositions are published by Henri Elkan Music Publishing Company, which he inherited through his wife’s family[2]. His work is noted for its ageless quality, aiming to reach audiences across generations by balancing the authority of the past with the creative freedom of the present[2][3].

## Fun Facts
- Alpern played rhythm guitar in a top 40s rock band called the Schades while studying sociology at Oberlin College, defying family expectations to pursue music professionally[4].
- He inherited Henri Elkan Music Publishing Company from his wife’s family; Henri Elkan was a notable classical musician who fled Holland during World War II and established the company in Philadelphia in 1958[2].
- Alpern’s album Skeleton is so named because it features a heavy trombone section ('bones') and reflects his creative approach of treating a tune like a skeleton and 'putting different skin on it'[2].
- Despite his deep jazz and classical training, Alpern’s early musical influences included Motown and 1960s rock, and he could play many famous songs of the era on guitar[1][2].
