## Biography
NADUH is a five-piece, femme-powered hip hop and R&B group based in Vancouver, Canada. Formed in the late 2010s, the group is notable for writing, engineering, and producing all of their own music, resulting in a sound that is both authentic and representative of their collective vision. Their music is characterized by sultry harmonies, powerful lyricism, and a blend of 90s R&B, funk, soul, and modern hip hop influences, creating a unique sonic identity that stands out in the contemporary music landscape.[3][4][5]

Emerging from Vancouver's vibrant music scene, NADUH quickly gained attention for their unapologetically femme-forward approach and their commitment to creative autonomy. Their songs often explore themes of empowerment, self-love, and cosmic connection, with an 'astrological twist' that reflects their playful and spiritual sensibilities. By handling every aspect of their music production, NADUH has established themselves as trailblazers for women and non-binary artists in the hip hop and R&B genres.[3][4][5][6]

Although still early in their career, NADUH's impact is already being felt in the Canadian music industry, where they are recognized for filling a gap in representation and for inspiring a new generation of artists to take control of their creative processes. Their live performances and recorded works continue to draw praise for their energy, cohesion, and the empowering messages they deliver.
