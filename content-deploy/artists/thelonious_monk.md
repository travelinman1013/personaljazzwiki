## Biography
Thelonious Sphere Monk was born on October 10, 1917, in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, and moved to New York City with his family at the age of three. He began playing piano at a young age, initially learning stride piano from a neighbor and later studying classical music under Simon Wolf, where he developed a fondness for Chopin and Rachmaninoff. Monk dropped out of Stuyvesant High School at 17 to pursue music, touring with an evangelist before settling in New York and becoming a paid jazz musician. He gained prominence in the 1940s as the house pianist at Minton's Playhouse in Harlem, where he played a pivotal role in the development of bebop alongside legends like Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie. Monk's unique improvisational style, characterized by angular melodies, percussive playing, and dissonant harmonies, was initially misunderstood but eventually recognized as revolutionary. Over his career, he composed enduring jazz standards such as 'Round Midnight,' Blue Monk,' and 'Straight, No Chaser,' and recorded for labels including Blue Note, Prestige, Riverside, and Columbia. Monk's influence extended far beyond his own recordings, shaping the course of modern jazz and earning him a place as one of the genre's most innovative composers and pianists.
