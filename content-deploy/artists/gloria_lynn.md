## Biography
Gloria Lynne, born Gloria Wilson (also known as Gloria Alleyne) on November 23, 1929, in Harlem, New York City, was a celebrated American jazz and R&B vocalist whose career spanned nearly five decades. Raised in a musically rich environment, Lynne's earliest influences came from her mother, a gospel singer, and from singing in the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church Choir. Her prodigious talent was recognized early when she won the Amateur Night contest at the Apollo Theater at age 15, setting her on a path toward professional music.

Lynne began her career in the 1950s, performing with vocal groups like the Enchanters and the Dell-Tones before launching her solo career. Signing with Everest Records in 1958, she quickly gained acclaim for her ability to bridge jazz, soul, and R&B, with her 1964 recording of 'I Wish You Love' becoming a signature classic. Throughout the 1960s, Lynne toured and shared stages with legends such as Ray Charles, Ella Fitzgerald, Billy Eckstine, and Johnny Mathis. Despite challenges with poor management and unpaid royalties, she sustained her career through live performances and songwriting, notably penning lyrics for Herbie Hancock's 'Watermelon Man.'

Lynne's artistry was marked by her rich, emotive voice and her affinity for romantic music, often interpreting love songs with great sensitivity. She continued performing and recording into the 2000s, earning honors such as the Rhythm and Blues Foundation's Pioneer Award and having July 25, 1995, proclaimed 'Gloria Lynne Day' in New York City. Lynne passed away on October 15, 2013, leaving a lasting legacy as one of the most expressive and influential voices in American jazz and soul.
