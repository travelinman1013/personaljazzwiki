## Biography
Koko Taylor, born Cora Anna Walton on September 28, 1928, in Bartlett, Tennessee, grew up in a sharecropper’s family near Memphis. Orphaned by age 11, she and her siblings worked in the cotton fields by day and made music together at night, inspired by blues legends like Bessie Smith and Memphis Minnie. In 1952, she moved to Chicago with her husband, Robert 'Pops' Taylor, seeking better opportunities. There, she worked as a housekeeper and began singing in the vibrant Chicago blues club scene, where her powerful, gritty vocals quickly drew attention.

Her big break came in 1962 when Willie Dixon, a prominent blues composer and producer, discovered her and secured her a contract with Chess Records. Taylor’s 1965 recording of 'Wang Dang Doodle,' written by Dixon, became a million-selling hit and established her as a major force in blues music. Over her career, she recorded for Chess and later Alligator Records, earning the title 'Queen of the Blues.' Taylor’s style blended Chicago blues, electric blues, rhythm and blues, and soul blues, characterized by her raw, impassioned delivery and commanding stage presence. She won more Blues Music Awards than any other female artist and was a Grammy winner, performing internationally for over four decades.

Taylor’s legacy is profound: she broke gender barriers in the male-dominated blues world, influenced generations of musicians, and brought Chicago blues to a global audience. Even after surviving a near-fatal car accident in 1989, she continued to tour extensively, performing over 70 shows a year until her final appearance in 2009. Koko Taylor died on June 3, 2009, in Chicago, leaving behind a lasting imprint on American music.
