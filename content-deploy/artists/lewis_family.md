## Biography
The Lewis Family, known as the 'First Family of Bluegrass Gospel,' originated from Lincolnton, Georgia, a small community of 1,500 residents on the northeast edge of the state. The family's musical journey began in 1947 as the Lewis Brothers, a string band featuring brothers Wallace, Esley, and Talmadge, who performed country music and fiddle tunes at local square dances. The group was founded by Pop Lewis (Roy Lewis Sr.) and Mom Lewis (Pauline Lewis, née Holloway), who married in 1925. In 1951, the family adopted the name The Lewis Family and made a pivotal stylistic shift to an all-gospel format, incorporating Pop on bass, his children Wallace on guitar, Talmadge on mandolin and fiddle, Roy M. 'Little Roy' on banjo, and daughters 'Miggie,' Polly, and Janis on vocals. This configuration would become their classic lineup and define their sound for decades to come.

Throughout their career spanning 58 years, The Lewis Family became one of the most prolific and celebrated acts in bluegrass gospel music. They recorded their first songs in 1953 at WJAT radio studios in Swainsboro, Georgia, initially intended for the Bibletone label before finding a home with Sullivan Records, which released two 78-rpm discs in 1954. By 1970, they moved to Canaan Records of Waco, Texas, one of the leading independent gospel labels, releasing 23 albums over 14 years—approximately one every seven months. Their stage show became legendary for its entertainment value, featuring hard-driving banjo instrumentals, trio vocal selections, spirituals, original compositions, and comedy routines. The group performed more than 200 dates annually and received more repeat bookings than any other band on the bluegrass festival circuit, appearing at prestigious venues including New York's Lincoln Center, The Smithsonian, and the Grand Ole Opry.

The Lewis Family's legacy was cemented through numerous accolades and their influence on bluegrass gospel music. They were inducted into the Gospel Music Hall of Fame in 2005 and the International Bluegrass Music Hall of Fame in 2006, receiving bluegrass music's highest honor. In 2000, each group member received the Grand Ole Gospel Reunion's 'Living Legend Award,' and in 2003, The Lewis Family Pavilion was dedicated in their hometown. The group recorded more than 60 albums and six videos throughout their career, recording for Daywind Music Group since 1995. They retired in 2009 after their final concert at The Lewis Family Pavilion in Lincolnton, Georgia, leaving behind a remarkable legacy that spanned three generations of family musicians and helped define the bluegrass gospel genre.
