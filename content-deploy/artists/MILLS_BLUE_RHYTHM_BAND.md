## Biography
The Mills Blue Rhythm Band was a prominent American big band formed in Harlem, New York City, in 1930, during the height of the swing era. Initially known as the Coconut Grove Orchestra, the group underwent several name changes before impresario Irving Mills took over as manager in 1931, branding them as the Mills Blue Rhythm Band. The band quickly became a fixture at Harlem’s famed Cotton Club, often performing as stand-ins for more famous acts like Duke Ellington and Cab Calloway, and earning a reputation as swing’s consummate utility players. Their versatility allowed them to excel in hot jazz, blues, and orchestrated pop, capturing the bustling energy of the Harlem Renaissance.[1][2][4]

Throughout the 1930s, the Mills Blue Rhythm Band was a revolving door of top-tier jazz talent, with musicians such as Henry “Red” Allen, J.C. Higginbotham, Charlie Holmes, and Charlie Shavers passing through its ranks. Leadership changed hands multiple times, with figures like Bingie Madison, Willie Lynch, Edgar Hayes, and finally Lucky Millinder shaping the band’s direction. Under Millinder’s leadership from 1934, the band achieved its greatest commercial success, recording over 150 sides for major labels including Brunswick, Columbia, and Victor. Despite producing hits like “Truckin’” and “Ride, Red, Ride,” the band never attained the enduring fame of its contemporaries, largely due to the lack of a singular, marketable frontman and Mills’ tendency to position them as understudies to his bigger acts.[1][2]

The group disbanded in 1938, with Millinder moving on to form his own successful orchestra. The Mills Blue Rhythm Band name was briefly revived in 1947 for two recording sessions, but only trumpeter Charlie Shavers returned from the original lineup. Today, the band’s recordings are regarded as jazz classics, prized by collectors and historians for their technical brilliance and their role in shaping the sound and culture of the swing era.[1][2]
