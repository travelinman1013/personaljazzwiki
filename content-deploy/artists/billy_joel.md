## Biography
Billy Joel was born on May 9, 1949, in the Bronx, New York, and demonstrated exceptional musical talent from an early age.[6] Steered toward classical music by his parents, he began piano lessons at age 4.[5] Inspired by the Beatles' iconic performance on The Ed Sullivan Show and the British Invasion, Joel fully committed to a career in music, dropping out of high school to pursue his rock star dreams.[2] His early professional journey proved challenging; in 1971, he recorded the poorly produced Cold Spring Harbor for Family Productions, which locked him into an exploitative long-term contract.[5] However, a live recording of his song "Captain Jack" caught the attention of Columbia Records executives in 1972, who extricated him from his contract and offered him a fresh start.[5]

Joel achieved his critical and commercial breakthrough with the 1973 release of Piano Man, whose title track became his signature song, ending nearly every concert.[4] Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, he became one of the most commercially successful artists in rock and pop music, releasing 12 studio albums from 1971 to 1993.[4] His 1977 album The Stranger marked a turning point in his career, establishing him as a major force in popular music.[4] The 1978 album 52nd Street reached number one on the Billboard charts and won multiple Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year.[3] His soft rock and pop compositions, often featuring introspective lyrics and sophisticated piano arrangements, resonated with audiences worldwide. By 1999, his global song sales exceeded $100 million, and he was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame by his idol, Ray Charles.[2]

Joel's legacy extends far beyond his recording career. He has accumulated 33 Top 40 hits and 23 Grammy nominations since signing his first solo recording contract in 1972.[1] He was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1992 and received the Johnny Mercer Award, the organization's highest honor, in 2001.[1] In 2014, Joel began a record-breaking residency at Madison Square Garden, a venue he had long considered a "temple," eventually performing 150 shows there before concluding the residency in July 2024, breaking the venue's record for the most lifetime performances by an artist.[5][6] His influence on popular music and his enduring commercial success have solidified his position as one of the most important singer-songwriters of the late 20th century.

## Fun Facts
- Billy Joel performed under a pseudonym in a Los Angeles piano bar while seeking refuge from his exploitative Family Productions contract, before Columbia Records discovered him through an underground recording of 'Captain Jack.'[5]
- In 2024, Joel performed 'Turn the Lights Back On,' his first new pop song in decades, at the Grammy Awards ceremony, marking a significant return to recording after focusing on classical music and touring.[5]
- Joel's residency at Madison Square Garden, which began in January 2014 and concluded in July 2024 with his 150th show, broke the venue's record for the most lifetime performances by any artist, a particularly meaningful achievement given that he had considered the Garden a 'temple' growing up.[5][6]
- In the early 2000s, Joel grappled with alcohol addiction and spent time in rehabilitation, but has since recovered and continued his musical career.[2]
