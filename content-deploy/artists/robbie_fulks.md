## Biography
Robbie Fulks, born Robert William Fulks on March 25, 1963 in York, Pennsylvania, is a pioneering figure in American alternative country and Americana music. Raised in a musically inclined family, Fulks spent his formative years in Pennsylvania, Virginia, and North Carolina, where he absorbed a wide range of traditional American music. He began playing banjo at age six and guitar at eleven, later attending Columbia University in New York City before leaving to pursue music full time. 

Fulks moved to Chicago in the early 1980s, joining the Special Consensus Bluegrass Band and teaching at the Old Town School of Folk Music. He became a staff songwriter in Nashville during the 1990s, but his solo career took off with the release of 'Country Love Songs' (1996) and 'South Mouth' (1997), records that helped define the alt-country movement. Known for his sharp wit, inventive storytelling, and instrumental virtuosity, Fulks has released over 15 albums, including the Grammy-nominated 'Upland Stories' (2016). His work spans honky tonk, bluegrass, and roots music, and he is celebrated for both his reverence for tradition and his willingness to push genre boundaries.

Over a career spanning more than three decades, Fulks has collaborated with a wide range of artists, produced records for others, and seen his songs covered by notable musicians. His influence on the Americana and alt-country scenes is profound, and his legacy is marked by both critical acclaim and a fiercely independent artistic spirit.
