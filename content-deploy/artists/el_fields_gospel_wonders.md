## Biography
E.L. Fields' Gospel Wonders is a gospel choir based at the Universal Church of God in New York City, active since at least the late 1970s, blending traditional gospel with funk elements to create a distinctive **gospel funk** style.[1][5] The group provided a platform for emerging vocalists, notably featuring Sharon Jones, who sang with them during her early career before her rise to fame in soul and funk.[3][4][5] Jones contributed original songs like 'Call on God,' written in the 1970s for the choir, reflecting the group's deep roots in church music and community worship.[4][5]

The choir's recordings remained obscure until the 2010s, when Daptone Records released 'Heaven Bound,' a late-1970s track featuring Sharon Jones' powerful vocals backed by the group's uplifting harmonies and funky instrumentation.[1][2][6] This release highlighted their role in Jones' formative years and preserved their **funk gospel** sound for modern audiences.[1][7] Though specific details on E.L. Fields' personal life are unavailable, the group's legacy endures through these archival efforts and Jones' later reflections on her gospel beginnings.[3][5]

Their influence persists in the revival of authentic soul-gospel hybrids, bridging 1970s church music with contemporary funk audiences, though no extensive discography or ongoing activity is documented beyond the Daptone single.[1][2]

## Fun Facts
- Sharon Jones wrote 'Call on God' for the group in the late 1970s, intending it for an all-gospel album that never materialized; it was later recorded during her Dap-Kings sessions in 2007.[4][5]
- 'Heaven Bound' marks the first released gospel funk recordings featuring Sharon Jones from the late 1970s, unearthed and issued by Daptone Records in 2017.[1][2]
- The choir operated out of the Universal Church of God in New York City, where Sharon Jones sang throughout much of her life before her mainstream success.[5]
