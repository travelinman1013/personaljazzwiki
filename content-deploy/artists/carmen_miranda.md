## Biography
Carmen Miranda, born Maria do Carmo Miranda da Cunha on February 9, 1909, in Marco de Canaveses, Portugal, moved to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, as an infant. Raised in a working-class family, she began working at a young age to support her household, first in a tie shop and later running a successful hat business. Her passion for music led her to sing at local parties and on radio, and by age 20, she was discovered by composer Josué de Barros, who helped launch her recording career. Her 1930 hit 'Pra Você Gostar de Mim (Taí)' made her a national sensation, and she quickly became Brazil's most popular recording artist of the decade, pioneering the samba genre on radio and in film.

Miranda's international breakthrough came in 1939 when Broadway producer Lee Shubert invited her to star in 'The Streets of Paris' in New York. She brought her Brazilian band, Bando da Lua, with her, ensuring the authenticity of her music. Her vibrant stage presence, signature fruit-laden hats, and energetic performances captivated American audiences, leading to a successful Hollywood film career with 14 feature films between 1940 and 1953, including 'Down Argentine Way' and 'That Night in Rio.' Miranda became an emblem of Latin American culture in the United States, though her flamboyant persona sometimes drew criticism for reinforcing stereotypes.

Musically, Miranda blended Brazilian samba with jazz and other Latin styles, influencing the development of tropical music in the Americas. Her legacy endures as a trailblazer for Latin artists in international entertainment, the first Latin American to leave her handprints at Hollywood’s Chinese Theatre, and a posthumous recipient of a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. She remains a symbol of cultural fusion and exuberant showmanship.
