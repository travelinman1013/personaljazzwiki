## Biography
Ernest Joseph "Tabby" Thomas, born January 5, 1929, in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, was a seminal figure in the development and preservation of swamp blues—a style rooted in the musical traditions of southern Louisiana. After graduating high school, Thomas served in the U.S. Air Force, where he won a talent contest on KSAN radio in San Francisco in 1959, besting future stars like Etta James and Johnny Mathis. This early recognition led to his first recording contract, but it was upon returning to Baton Rouge that Thomas began to shape his legacy, recording for several local labels before finding success with Excello Records, notably with the 1961 single "Hoodoo Party".[1][2]

Throughout the 1960s and beyond, Thomas became a central figure in Baton Rouge's blues scene, performing with his band the Mellow, Mellow Men and collaborating with local musicians. He briefly retired from performing to found his own label, Blue Beat, supporting regional artists. In 1978, he and his family, including his son Chris Thomas King, opened Tabby's Blues Box and Heritage Hall, which became Baton Rouge's premier blues venue and a hub for the genre until its closure in 2004. Thomas also gained international recognition, performing regularly in the UK and Europe, and remained active as a performer and radio host until health issues curtailed his career. He passed away on January 1, 2014, leaving a profound impact on Louisiana blues and a legacy as a champion of the swamp blues tradition.[1][2][5]
