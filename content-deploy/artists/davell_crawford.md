## Biography
Davell Crawford, acclaimed as the 'Piano Prince of New Orleans,' is a multi-talented musician who represents the continuation of New Orleans' legendary piano tradition.[1][2] Born into a musical family with deep roots in the city's cultural heritage, Crawford began playing piano at the remarkably young age of two and performed professionally starting at age seven.[8] He grew up immersed in New Orleans' rich musical landscape, influenced by the city's unique blend of jazz, gospel, funk, R&B, and traditional Creole music. His grandfather, James 'Sugar Boy' Crawford, was a renowned pianist who passed down the distinctive New Orleans piano tradition characterized by a strong left hand and grooved accompaniment style.[1]

Crawford's musical identity synthesizes classical training, church music from his upbringing in Catholic and Baptist communities, and the improvisational traditions of New Orleans jazz and funk.[1] His style encompasses modern and classic jazz, rhythm and blues, funk, blues, gospel, and soul, creating what he describes as a 'gumbo' of musical influences.[1][2] He has performed extensively throughout the United States and internationally, touring countries including Spain, Italy, France, Russia, Finland, Brazil, Morocco, and Portugal.[2] Beyond his performance career, Crawford has been a dedicated advocate for the arts, teaching in schools and conducting master classes about American roots music and the importance of preserving New Orleans' musical heritage.[2]

Crawford stands as one of the few contemporary musicians committed to keeping the piano sounds of New Orleans alive while adding freshness and vitality to the tradition.[2] He has become one of the most versatile and documented young piano players in America, recognized for his responsibility to preserve, carry forth, and breathe new life into the music of his heritage.[1] His work reflects a deep understanding of New Orleans' tribal musical community and its philosophy of collective support and mentorship among musicians.
