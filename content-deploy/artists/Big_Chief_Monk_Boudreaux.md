## Biography
Joseph 'Big Chief Monk' Boudreaux, born Joseph Pierre Boudreaux in New Orleans, Louisiana, grew up deeply immersed in the Mardi Gras Indian tradition. His family, of both African American and Native American descent, was rooted in the masking culture, with his father serving as a major influence and mentor. Monk began masking at age 12, learning the songs, chants, and sewing techniques that define the tradition, initially under the guidance of his father and later the legendary Black Johnny, a renowned singer among the Indians. 

Boudreaux's career took off in the 1960s when he joined the Wild Magnolias, a group that helped bring the Mardi Gras Indian sound to a broader audience. He later became Big Chief of the Golden Eagles, a position of great honor and responsibility, earned through years of dedication and leadership. Monk's innovative approach to music—incorporating traditional Indian chants with funk, jazz, and other New Orleans genres—has led to Grammy nominations and performances at major festivals, including the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival since its inception. He is also featured in the award-winning documentary 'Bury the Hatchet' and has received the National Endowment for the Arts National Heritage Fellowship, the highest honor in U.S. folk and traditional arts.

Musically, Boudreaux is celebrated for his improvisational style, blending traditional Mardi Gras Indian rhythms with contemporary influences, and for his role in preserving and evolving the culture. As an educator and mentor, he continues to teach younger generations the importance of the tradition, ensuring its survival and relevance. His legacy is not only in his recordings and performances but also in his tireless work to keep the spirit and artistry of the Mardi Gras Indians alive.

## Fun Facts
