## Biography
Jaimie “Breezy” Branch (stylized as jaimie branch) was an American trumpeter, composer, and bandleader whose work fused free jazz, punk, noise, and electronic experimentation. Born on June 17, 1983 in Huntington, New York, she began playing trumpet at age nine and performed her first improvised solo with her middle-school jazz band at 11.[2][3] In her early teens she transcribed Miles Davis’s solo on “On Green Dolphin Street,” played in jazz, classical, and rock ensembles, and at 14 moved with her family to Wilmette, a suburb of Chicago, where exposure to the city’s rich creative-music scene became foundational to her artistic identity.[2][3] From 2001–2005 she studied at the New England Conservatory of Music, earning a Bachelor of Music in jazz trumpet performance and studying with figures such as Joe Morris, Steve Lacy, John McNeil, and Charles Schlueter.[2][3][4]

After returning to Chicago, Branch worked as a musician, organizer, sound engineer, and presenter, holding a job at the Jazz Record Mart, booking punk and free-jazz shows, and immersing herself in Fred Anderson’s Velvet Lounge community.[2][3] She became an in-demand collaborator, recording with Jason Ajemian, Keefe Jackson’s Project Project, Tim Daisy’s New Fracture Quartet, and others, while leading projects like her trio Princess, Princess and the group Bomb Shelter.[1][2][3] In 2012 she moved to Baltimore to pursue a master’s degree in jazz performance at Towson University and founded the label Pionic Records, before relocating to New York to address heroin addiction and ultimately settling in Brooklyn in 2015.[2][3] There she launched her acclaimed quartet Fly or Die and the electro-acoustic duo Anteloper with drummer Jason Nazary, issuing a run of boundary-pushing albums on International Anthem, including her debut “Fly or Die” (2017), “Fly or Die II: Bird Dogs of Paradise” (2019), and the posthumously released “Fly or Die Fly or Die Fly or Die (World War)” (2023).[2][3]

Branch’s music is marked by a fierce, vocal-like trumpet sound, long sustained tones, timbral experimentation with mutes and electronics, and a compositional language that balances groove, melodic hooks, and open-form improvisation.[3] She cited Don Cherry, Axel Dörner, Booker Little, Miles Davis, and Evan Parker among her key influences, and her bands often folded song forms, political commentary, and punk energy into an avant-garde jazz framework.[2][3] Deeply embedded in community-oriented scenes in Chicago, Baltimore, and Brooklyn’s Red Hook neighborhood, she collaborated with a wide spectrum of artists—from free-jazz elders like William Parker and David Murray to noise group Wolf Eyes, Brazilian singer Elza Soares, Rob Mazurek’s Exploding Star Orchestra, and British poet-saxophonist Alabaster dePlume—helping redefine the boundaries of contemporary improvised music.[3] Branch died at home in Red Hook, Brooklyn, on August 22, 2022, at age 39 from an accidental drug overdose, leaving behind a compact but widely celebrated body of work that has become a touchstone for a new generation of experimental jazz musicians.[2][3]

## Fun Facts
- Branch intentionally stylized her professional name in all lower-case (“jaimie branch”) as an aesthetic choice aligned with her underground and DIY sensibilities.[3]
- As a teenager she was the youngest member of a ska-punk band at her high school while simultaneously playing in the school’s jazz and classical orchestras, foreshadowing her later fusion of punk, jazz, and experimental music.[3]
- For one of her senior recitals at New England Conservatory, she arranged a song by the experimental rock band Mr. Bungle, reflecting her comfort crossing between avant-rock and jazz worlds.[3]
- She was deeply involved in community-building in Brooklyn’s Red Hook, helping produce the Brackish music series and becoming, in the words of her label, one of the neighborhood’s informal “mayors” thanks to her presence at venues like Bait & Tackle and 360 Record Shop.[3]
