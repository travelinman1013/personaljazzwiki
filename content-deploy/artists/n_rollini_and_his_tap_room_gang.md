## Biography
Adrian Rollini and his Tap Room Gang was a jazz ensemble led by multi-instrumentalist Adrian Francis Rollini, operating primarily in the mid-to-late 1930s based at the Hotel President in New York City. The group emerged during a transformative period in Rollini's career, as he transitioned from the hot jazz style of the 1920s California Ramblers era toward a more polished, centered sound that characterized the swing era. Rollini, born June 28, 1903, in New York to Italian parents, was a child prodigy who began piano lessons at age two and performed classical pieces at the Waldorf Astoria by age four. By the time he established Adrian's Tap Room in 1935 at the Hotel President (234 West 48th Street), he had already built a formidable reputation as a bass saxophonist, pianist, vibraphonist, and bandleader across multiple ensembles throughout the 1920s and early 1930s.

The Tap Room Gang represented Rollini's most direct engagement with nightclub performance and management, as he not only led the small ensemble of 6-8 players but also managed the club itself. The group became known for featuring Rollini's combo augmented by visiting jazz musicians, creating a dynamic performance space that reflected the collaborative spirit of the swing era. Notably, Rollini assembled a mixed-race group to perform at Adrian's Tap Room in July 1935, demonstrating progressive racial integration in jazz performance at approximately the same time as Benny Goodman's more widely celebrated band integration. During this period, Rollini began concentrating more heavily on vibraphone and appeared on radio broadcasts, including work on the Hit Parade in 1936. The Tap Room Gang operated until Rollini's death on May 15, 1956, serving as a testament to his enduring influence and commitment to live jazz performance in New York's vibrant music scene.
