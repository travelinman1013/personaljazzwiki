## Biography
Kokoroko is a London-based Afrobeat and jazz fusion band formed in 2014 by trumpeter Sheila Maurice-Grey and percussionist Onome Edgeworth, who met during an arts trip in Kenya. Inspired by their shared desire to connect young people of the African diaspora with genres like Afrobeat and Highlife, they returned to London and assembled a group of like-minded musicians, many of whom came from the Trinity Laban Conservatory and the influential music education foundation Tomorrow's Warriors[1][3]. The band's name, 'Kokoroko,' is derived from the Urhobo language of southern Nigeria, meaning 'be strong' or 'hard to break'[2][4].

Kokoroko quickly became a vital force in the burgeoning London jazz scene, blending West African musical traditions with elements of funk, jazz, hip-hop, grime, gospel, and Caribbean sounds. Their breakthrough came in 2018 when their track 'Abusey Junction,' featured on Gilles Peterson's 'We Out Here' compilation, went viral and garnered millions of streams[2][3]. The band followed up with a self-titled EP in 2019 and their debut album 'Could We Be More' in 2022, which was named one of The Guardian's top ten albums of the year[2]. Their music is characterized by lush horn arrangements, polyrhythmic grooves, and a commitment to honoring and evolving the legacy of West African music[1][4][5].

Kokoroko's legacy is marked by their role in revitalizing and reinterpreting Afrobeat and Highlife for new audiences, especially within the Black British diaspora. Their all-female brass section, led by Maurice-Grey, and collaborative approach to composition and performance have made them a standout ensemble in contemporary jazz and world music. In 2025, they released their second album, 'Tuff Times Never Last,' further cementing their reputation as innovators and ambassadors of diasporic musical heritage[2].
