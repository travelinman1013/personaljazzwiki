## Biography
Stereolab is an Anglo-French avant-pop band formed in London, England, in 1990 by guitarist/keyboardist Tim Gane and French vocalist/multi-instrumentalist Laetitia Sadier, following the dissolution of Gane's previous band, McCarthy. The pair quickly established a prolific partnership, releasing a string of EPs and their debut album 'Peng!' in 1992, and soon expanded the lineup to include key members such as Mary Hansen (vocals, guitar, keyboards, percussion) and Andy Ramsay (drums), both of whom became integral to the band's sound. Stereolab distinguished themselves by blending 1950s–60s pop, lounge music, and the 'motorik' rhythms of krautrock with vintage keyboards and experimental structures, earning them early recognition as pioneers of the 'post-rock' genre.[1][2][3]

Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, Stereolab released a series of critically acclaimed albums, including 'Transient Random-Noise Bursts With Announcements,' 'Emperor Tomato Ketchup,' and 'Dots and Loops.' Their music was marked by intricate arrangements, use of irregular time signatures, and a unique mix of English and French lyrics. The band also founded their own label, Duophonic Records, which allowed them creative independence. Despite the tragic loss of Mary Hansen in 2002, Stereolab continued to evolve, releasing new material and maintaining a dedicated cult following. Their influence extended beyond their own recordings, impacting a generation of alternative and electronic musicians.[1][2][3][4]

Stereolab's legacy is defined by their innovative fusion of genres, their embrace of both pop sensibility and avant-garde experimentation, and their role in legitimizing and popularizing sounds previously considered outside the mainstream rock canon. Their work has inspired numerous artists and remains a touchstone for fans of art pop, krautrock, and neo-psychedelia.[1][2][3]
