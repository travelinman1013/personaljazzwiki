## Biography
The Shirelles were an American girl group formed in 1957 in Passaic, New Jersey, consisting of four teenage schoolmates: Shirley Owens (later Shirley Alston Reeves), Doris Kenner Jackson, Micki Harris, and Beverly Lee. Originally performing under the name the Poquellos at their high school talent show, they caught the attention of Florence Greenberg, owner of Tiara Records, after her daughter Mary Jane Greenberg insisted the girls audition. After signing to Tiara Records and later to Greenberg's newly formed Scepter Records in 1959, the group worked with producer and songwriter Luther Dixon, who became instrumental in shaping their sound and career trajectory. Their breakthrough came with "Tonight's the Night" in 1960, which reached number 39 on the charts, followed by their landmark hit "Will You Love Me Tomorrow" (1960), written by Carole King and Gerry Goffin, which became the first girl group record to reach number one on the Billboard charts.

During the early 1960s, The Shirelles achieved remarkable commercial success, producing seven top 20 hits and six top 10 hits in less than three years, establishing themselves as one of the most popular vocal groups of the era. Their sophisticated vocal harmonies and blend of doo-wop and rhythm and blues influenced an entire generation of girl groups. However, their fortunes declined in the mid-1960s due to the British Invasion and intense competition from other girl groups such as The Supremes, The Ronettes, and Martha & the Vandellas. Legal disputes with Scepter Records kept them contractually bound until 1966, preventing them from recording elsewhere during a critical period. Their last charting single was "Last Minute Miracle" in 1967, which peaked at number 99.

After leaving Scepter Records, The Shirelles continued recording and touring with various lineup changes. In 1968, original member Doris Jackson retired to raise her family, reducing the group to a trio. The group subsequently signed with United Artists Records in 1970 and RCA Records in 1971, their final major label. Though their hit-making days had ended, The Shirelles remained active performers for decades, leaving an enduring legacy as pioneers of the girl group era and paving the way for countless female vocal groups that followed. By their 2014 induction into the New Jersey Hall of Fame, only Shirley Alston Reeves and Beverly Lee survived among the original members.

## Fun Facts
- The Shirelles' name was created by Florence Greenberg, who combined lead singer Shirley Owens' first name with "The Chantels" to create a more commercial group name, changing from their original name "The Poquellos."
- "I Met Him on a Sunday," their debut single that launched their career, was a song the girls wrote themselves for their high school talent show, and it reached number 49 on the Billboard charts in April 1958 when they were still teenagers.
- In 1964, The Shirelles discovered there was no money left in the Greenberg trust fund that was created to protect their earnings, leading to legal disputes and a court injunction that prevented them from leaving Scepter Records despite their desire to do so.
- "Will You Love Me Tomorrow" was selected by Rolling Stone as one of the greatest songs of all time, cementing its status as a pop classic and a landmark achievement in music history.
