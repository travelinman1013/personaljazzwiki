## Biography
Rockin' Dopsie, born Alton Jay Rubin on February 10, 1932, in Carencro, Louisiana, emerged as one of the founding architects of zydeco music alongside Boozoo Chavis and Clifton Chenier.[2][4] After moving to Lafayette, Louisiana at age 19, Dopsie began performing in clubs during the mid-1950s, initially playing washboard with his cousin Chester Zeno before adopting his now-iconic stage name from a visiting dancer called Doopsie.[2] His musical trajectory accelerated significantly in 1955 when he met Clifton Chenier, zydeco's most important founding father, whose mentorship proved transformative in helping Dopsie realize his full potential as a musician.[4] Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, Dopsie recorded occasionally for small independent labels while maintaining his day job as an electrical contractor, but his career gained substantial momentum beginning in 1976 when he was signed by Swedish record label Sonet and released his first album, *Doin' The Zydeco*.[2] Starting in 1979, Dopsie toured Europe regularly with his group, the Twisters, achieving remarkable popularity abroad—notably performing before a crowd of 5,000 at the 1987 Montreux Festival despite a rainstorm.[4] His breakthrough in the American mainstream came in 1986 when he played accordion on Paul Simon's Grammy award-winning album *Graceland*, specifically on the track "That Was Your Mother (Standing On The Corner In Lafayette, Louisiana)."[1][2] Rockin' Dopsie passed away on August 26, 1993, but his legacy endured through his sons, with his son David (Rockin' Dopsie Jr.) continuing to lead the Zydeco Twisters and maintaining the family's status as "Zydeco's Royal Family."[1][2]

## Fun Facts
- Rockin' Dopsie took his stage name from a visiting dancer called Doopsie, pronouncing his own name the same way, which became the iconic 'Dopsie' (pronounced 'Doopsie') that defined his seven-decade legacy in zydeco.[1][2]
- At the 1987 Montreux Festival, a crowd of 5,000 people braved a rainstorm to dance to Rockin' Dopsie and his Zydeco Twisters, demonstrating his remarkable popularity in Europe.[4]
- Rockin' Dopsie Jr. has been called 'The James Brown of Zydeco' and 'The Mick Jagger of the Swamps' due to his high-energy showmanship, performing dynamic stage moves including agile splits in the James Brown tradition.[1][5]
