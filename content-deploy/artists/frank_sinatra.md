## Biography
Frank Sinatra, born Francis Albert Sinatra on December 12, 1915, in Hoboken, New Jersey, was the son of Italian immigrants and grew up in a working-class neighborhood. He began his musical journey in the 1930s, first gaining attention as the lead singer of the Hoboken Four, which won a radio talent show and performed locally. His big break came in 1939 when bandleader Harry James discovered him and invited him to join his orchestra, followed by a pivotal stint with Tommy Dorsey’s orchestra, where Sinatra’s emotive vocal style and smooth phrasing quickly made him a national sensation[1][2][3][4].

Sinatra launched his solo career in 1942, signing with Columbia Records and releasing his debut album, 'The Voice of Frank Sinatra,' in 1946. He became the idol of the 'bobby soxers'—young female fans drawn to his romantic crooning. Throughout the 1950s, Sinatra refined his artistry at Capitol Records, working with arranger Nelson Riddle on landmark albums like 'In the Wee Small Hours' and 'Songs for Swingin' Lovers!' His career extended into acting, earning him an Academy Award for 'From Here to Eternity.' In 1960, Sinatra founded Reprise Records, collaborating with jazz legends such as Count Basie, Duke Ellington, and Antonio Carlos Jobim, and continued to release acclaimed albums and perform globally[1][3][5][8].

Sinatra’s musical style blended jazz, swing, and big band influences, marked by impeccable phrasing and emotional depth. He was celebrated for his charismatic stage presence and versatility, recording approximately 1,800 songs and appearing in dozens of films. His legacy endures as one of the most influential entertainers of the 20th century, inspiring generations of vocalists and musicians. Sinatra passed away on May 14, 1998, leaving behind a profound impact on American music and culture[1][3][8].
