## Biography
Mary Lane, born November 23, 1935, in Clarendon, Arkansas, is a legendary blues singer whose career has spanned over six decades. Growing up in the rural South, she spent her early years picking cotton before moving to Chicago, where she became a mainstay of the city's West Side blues scene. Her powerful voice and authentic delivery quickly earned her respect among blues aficionados, though she remained relatively under-recognized for much of her career. Over the years, Lane has performed at iconic Chicago blues clubs and has released several albums, including 'Travelin’ Woman,' which marked her debut on the Women of the Blues label. Her music is deeply rooted in the Chicago blues tradition, characterized by gritty vocals and emotional storytelling.

Lane’s style is a blend of classic West Side blues with elements of southern gothic and grunge, reflecting both her Southern roots and her urban Chicago experience. Despite her late recognition, she has become a celebrated figure in the blues community, with a new documentary, 'I Can Only Be Mary Lane,' highlighting her life and legacy. At age 86, Lane continues to inspire new generations of blues musicians and fans, embodying the resilience and spirit of the genre.
