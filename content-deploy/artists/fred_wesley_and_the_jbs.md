## Biography
Fred Wesley and the JBs are a seminal force in the evolution of funk and jazz-funk, led by trombonist and bandleader Fred Wesley. Born in Columbus, Georgia, and raised in Mobile, Alabama, Wesley began his musical journey as a teenage trombonist with Ike and Tina Turner. His career took a pivotal turn when he joined James Brown’s band in 1968, quickly rising to the roles of music director, arranger, and primary composer. Wesley was instrumental in shifting Brown’s sound from soul to funk, contributing signature grooves and solos that defined the genre’s language. As the leader of The J.B.'s, Wesley co-wrote and performed on numerous hits, including 'Doing It to Death,' which sold over a million copies and earned a gold record.

After leaving James Brown’s band in 1975, Wesley, alongside saxophonist Maceo Parker, joined George Clinton’s Parliament-Funkadelic collective, further pushing the boundaries of funk. He also collaborated with Bootsy’s Rubber Band, solidifying his reputation as one of funk’s most influential architects. In the late 1970s, Wesley expanded his reach into jazz, joining the Count Basie Orchestra and later releasing several jazz albums as a leader. The band, now known as Fred Wesley and the New JBs, continues to celebrate the roots of funk and jazz, performing classic hits and new compositions worldwide. Wesley’s legacy is marked by his innovative arrangements, genre-defining trombone work, and his role as a bridge between soul, funk, and jazz traditions.
