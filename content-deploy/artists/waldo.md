## Biography
Waldo Mendoza is a Cuban singer and songwriter known as one of the prominent romantic voices in contemporary Cuban popular music.[1][5][7] Born in Havana on September 22, 1966, he studied Musical Education at the Enrique José Varona Higher Pedagogical Institute, where he was already composing songs and participating in university festivals.[1][7] One of his early pieces, “Vivirás feliz,” won five special awards at the University Student Federation (FEU) Festival in 1985, signaling his potential as a composer and performer.[1] After graduating, he began his professional career in Santiago de Cuba, immersing himself in the country’s rich musical traditions and building his reputation regionally.[1][7]

In Santiago he founded the group La Idea, touring with it to Spain, Czechoslovakia and Germany, which broadened his artistic outlook and performance experience.[1][7] He later joined the Salsa Caracol orchestra, performing in venues such as the Hotel Santiago and touring to Jamaica in 1997, before returning to Havana to co‑found the group Tumbao Habana with bandleader Pascual Cabrera, who incorporated Mendoza’s songs into the group’s repertoire.[1][7] Although active in timba and salsa projects, Mendoza’s personal preference for bolero and romantic ballads led him to pursue a solo career, where he cultivated a style that fuses traditional Cuban song forms with contemporary Latin pop and ballad sensibilities.[1][4][5] Albums such as “Repartiendo Amor” (Bis Music, 2013) and “Época de amar” (EGREM, 2017), along with projects like “Santiago en mí” recorded with tres player Fernando Dewar and Septeto Santiaguero, showcase his warm, expressive voice and his focus on themes of love, family and everyday life.[1][5][7]

Over more than two decades as a solo artist, Waldo Mendoza has become widely recognized in Cuba for his elegant stage presence and his clear, in‑tune, emotive singing, earning him the informal title of “la voz romántica de Cuba.”[5] He has held a long‑running residency at the Café Cantante Mi Habana at the National Theater of Cuba, performing there regularly on Saturdays for roughly twenty years, and celebrating his 20th anniversary as a soloist with the campaign and DVD “20 Años. Bendito tiempo,” which compiles many of his own compositions and several video clips.[5] His work has been honored with awards such as the Popularity Award in the Adolfo Guzmán Music Contest (2007), multiple popularity prizes on Cuban television program “Entre tú y yo” (2011–2013), a Cubadisco Award for the live DVD “Hojas del alma,” and a Lucas Award for Best Video Ballad for the video of his song “Quién,” underscoring his impact within Cuba’s romantic and pop music landscape.[1][5]
