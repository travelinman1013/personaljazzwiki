## Biography
Billy Paul, born Paul Williams on December 1, 1934, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, was a pioneering American soul singer best known for his 1972 Grammy-winning hit "Me and Mrs. Jones." Raised in a musically supportive family, Paul began singing at age 11 on local radio and received formal training at the West Philadelphia Music School and the Granoff School of Music. His early exposure to jazz and club performances, including a formative week performing alongside Charlie Parker at age 16, deeply shaped his artistic approach. 

Paul's career spanned jazz, soul, and the emerging Philadelphia soul sound of the 1970s, working closely with producers Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff. His vocal style was distinctive for its blend of smoothness and grit, influenced by female jazz vocalists and his own aspirations to play saxophone—he often described his singing as treating his voice like a horn. Beyond "Me and Mrs. Jones," Paul's catalog includes adventurous albums like "War of the Gods," which fused soul, funk, and psychedelic elements. Despite facing radio resistance for his more socially conscious material, Paul remained a respected figure in soul music until his death in 2016.

Billy Paul's legacy is that of a versatile and socially aware artist, celebrated for his contributions to the Philadelphia soul movement and for inspiring later generations of musicians with his unique vocal phrasing and commitment to musical innovation.
