## Biography
Cary Lewis Morin is an American singer, songwriter, and fingerstyle guitarist born in Billings, Montana, and now based in Fort Collins, Colorado.[1][2] A member of the Crow Nation with Assiniboine Sioux and Black heritage, Morin grew up in Great Falls, Montana, near the Crow Reservation in a household steeped in diverse musical influences ranging from traditional Crow music to contemporary rock, country, and pop.[3][4] He began his musical journey at age five when his mother arranged piano lessons by trading laundry services with a neighbor, though he gravitated toward learning songs by ear from the radio rather than formal instruction. At age 10, he picked up the guitar and never looked back, recognizing early that music would be his life's calling.[4] His family's cultural heritage profoundly shaped his artistic vision, particularly his grandfather's brother Thomas Yellowtail, the spiritual leader and Sun Dance Chief of the Crow Nation, whose wisdom and presence at his early performances inspired Morin's songwriting and worldview.

Throughout his career, Morin has developed a distinctive musical style characterized as "acoustic Native Americana" that seamlessly blends bluegrass, blues, jazz, reggae, folk, and rock elements.[1][3] His musical influences include Neil Young, Bob Marley, and Jimi Hendrix, and he has been compared to Oklahoma guitarist Jesse Ed Davis for his innovative approach to fingerstyle playing.[2] Beginning in the late 1980s, Morin performed in local country, rock, and bluegrass bands as a teenager, then formed the three-piece dance band The Atoll in 1989, which gained recognition as "Best of Colorado" on Denver's KMGH-TV.[1] He later collaborated with Pura Fé on multiple recordings and has performed as a solo artist, with his wife Celeste Di Iorio in the Cary Morin Duo, and with his band Ghost Dog, which offers diverse musical arrangements showcasing his versatility.[2][4]

Morin's international touring career has established him as a major figure in contemporary Native American music, performing at prestigious venues including the Kennedy Center, Lincoln Center, Paris Jazz Festival, and the 2010 Vancouver Olympics.[1][3] His discography spans from 1993's *Circle of Friends* through his most recent album *Innocent Allies* (2024), with notable releases including *Cradle to the Grave* (2017), *When I Rise* (2018), and *Dockside Saints* (2020).[1] He has received numerous accolades including a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Fort Collins Music Association, two Indigenous Music Awards for Best Blues Album, an Independent Music Award, and recognition from NPR Music for his live performance of "Jug In The Water" as one of the best live sessions of 2020.[1] Beyond music, Morin co-authored *Turtle Island*, a 50-member stage production that played to sold-out audiences in Northern Colorado for two consecutive years, demonstrating his commitment to cultural storytelling and community engagement.[1]
