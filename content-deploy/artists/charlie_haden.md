## Biography
Charlie Haden was born on August 6, 1937, in Shenandoah, Iowa, into a highly musical family that performed as the Haden Family on KMA radio, playing country and folk music. Haden began his musical journey as a singer, making his professional debut at just two years old. His early life was shaped by both his family's musical environment and a bout with polio at age fifteen, which ended his singing career but led him to focus on the double bass—a passion inspired initially by the music of Johann Sebastian Bach.

In the late 1950s, Haden moved to Los Angeles, where he became immersed in the jazz scene and played with legends such as Art Pepper, Hampton Hawes, and Paul Bley. His most significant early contribution came as the bassist for Ornette Coleman's revolutionary quartet, where Haden helped redefine the role of the bass in jazz, moving beyond traditional accompaniment to a more liberated, interactive approach. Over the next decades, Haden's career spanned a wide array of genres and collaborations, including his politically charged Liberation Music Orchestra, his work with Keith Jarrett, and his own Quartet West. He was also a prolific recording artist, composer, and educator, known for his lyrical style and deep commitment to musical and social expression.

Haden's legacy is profound: he is celebrated as one of the most influential jazz bassists, admired for his melodic improvisation, harmonic innovation, and ability to bridge genres from free jazz to cool jazz and even country. His work inspired generations of musicians, and his recordings remain touchstones for both their artistry and their social consciousness.
