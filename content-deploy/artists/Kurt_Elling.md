## Biography
Kurt Elling, born November 2, 1967, in Chicago, Illinois, and raised in Rockford, is widely regarded as one of the leading jazz vocalists of his generation. His early musical exposure came through his father, who was Kapellmeister at a Lutheran church, instilling in Elling a love for singing in choirs and playing various instruments[2][6]. Elling discovered jazz during his college years at Gustavus Adolphus College in Minnesota, which inspired him to leave the University of Chicago Divinity School one credit short of graduation to pursue a full-time career in jazz[2][6].

Elling began performing in Chicago clubs, developing a distinctive style characterized by theatricality, improvisational scat singing, and poetic lyricism[1][3]. He was signed to Blue Note Records in the mid-1990s, releasing his debut album 'Close Your Eyes' in 1995, followed by a string of critically acclaimed albums. Over his career, Elling has been nominated for 17 Grammy Awards, winning twice for Best Jazz Vocal Album, and has topped the DownBeat Critics and Readers polls for over a decade[4][5]. His rich baritone voice and four-octave range, combined with his inventive approach to vocalese and contemporary Beat lyricism, have earned him comparisons to Frank Sinatra and recognition as a singular force in vocal jazz[4][5].

Elling's legacy includes expanding the vocabulary of jazz singing and collaborating with elite jazz musicians and orchestras worldwide. He has performed in over 70 countries, headlining major festivals and venues, and is celebrated for his compelling storytelling and virtuosic improvisation[5]. His influence is felt not only through his recordings and performances but also through his role as a mentor and collaborator, shaping the next generation of jazz vocalists.
