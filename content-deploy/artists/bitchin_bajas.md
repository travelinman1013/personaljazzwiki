## Biography
Bitchin Bajas is a Chicago-based instrumental trio known for hypnotic, psychedelic music blending synthesizers with guitars, flutes, and saxophones, drawing from krautrock, space rock, drone, and ambient genres. Formed in 2010 as a solo side project by guitarist and organist Cooper Crain of the psych/krautrock band Cave, the project began with a focus on textural, less aggressive psychedelia compared to Cave's rhythmic intensity, starting with the full-length Tones & Zones that same year. The group quickly expanded its prolific output through cassettes, EPs, split singles, and albums like 2011's Water Wrackets, 2012's Vibraquatic, and 2013's Bitchitronics, released on Drag City.[1][2][3]

The lineup solidified into a trio with the addition of Dan Quinlivan from Mahjongg, enhancing synth and guitar layers, followed by Rob Frye, also from Cave, on flute, saxophone, and guitar. Their sound evolved into sprawling, kosmische explorations on releases like the 2014 self-titled double album, 2015's Transporteur and Automaginary (with Natural Information Society), and 2016's Epic Jammers and Fortunate Little Ditties with Bonnie 'Prince' Billy. Further milestones include the 2017 double album Bajas Fresh, 2018's seven-disc compilation Rebajas, 2021's Sun Ra tribute Switched on Ra, 2022's Bajascillators, and an upcoming album announced in 2025.[1][2][6][7]

Bitchin Bajas' legacy lies in their balance of minimalist hypnosis and ambitious experimentation, influencing modern krautrock revival scenes through frequent Drag City releases, film soundtracks like Sailing a Sinking Sea (2016), and live performances that evoke Robert Fripp's guitar work and New Age mysticism. Their catalog reflects a steady evolution from lo-fi origins to polished, immersive kosmische soundscapes.[1][2]
