## Biography
Arnold McCuller, born and raised in Cleveland, Ohio, is a renowned American vocalist, songwriter, and record producer whose career spans over five decades. His passion for music was ignited early, influenced by the vibrant R&B scene in Cleveland and formative experiences singing in church choirs. After a pivotal stint with the national touring company of 'Hair,' McCuller joined the vocal quartet Revelation in the mid-1970s, recording an album and several singles before launching his solo career in 1979 with a standout cover of 'Nowhere to Run' featured in the film 'The Warriors.'

McCuller became widely recognized as a featured vocalist for James Taylor, with whom he toured and recorded from 1977 until his retirement from touring in 2022. His soulful performances, especially his solo sections in 'Shower the People,' became concert highlights and led to appearances at significant events, including President Obama's inauguration. Beyond Taylor, McCuller was a key touring and recording collaborator with Phil Collins, taking lead vocals on songs such as 'Separate Lives' and 'Easy Lover.' His solo discography, which includes seven studio and two live albums, showcases his versatility across genres like smooth jazz, blues, and Latin pop. McCuller's legacy is defined by his rich, adaptable voice and his influence as both a solo artist and a sought-after session and touring musician.
