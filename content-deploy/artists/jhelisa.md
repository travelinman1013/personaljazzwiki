## Biography
Jhelisa Anderson, born in Jackson, Mississippi, grew up in a musical family, singing in Baptist churches across the American South as part of the Little David Family with her vocalist mother and gospel radio host father, who played piano and organ. The family toured churches and gospel events, releasing their first record when she was just five years old. At sixteen, she moved to Los Angeles, working briefly at Motown before being fired upon discovery of her singing talent, then relocated to London in the early 1990s, joining Soul Family Sensation for their album 'New Wave' on One Little Indian Records and contributing to The Shamen's 'Boss Drum' and Björk's 'Debut'.[1][2][4][7]
