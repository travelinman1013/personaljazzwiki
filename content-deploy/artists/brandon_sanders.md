## Biography
Brandon Sanders is an American jazz drummer whose unconventional journey into music has become a hallmark of his artistry. Born on February 20, 1971, in Kansas City, Kansas, Sanders was immersed in a musical environment from an early age—his mother was a classical violinist, his biological father played trumpet, and his stepfather was a trombonist. His grandmother, Ernestine Parker, operated Casablanca, a legendary Kansas City jazz club frequented by icons like Lou Donaldson and Grant Green, instilling in him a deep appreciation for jazz’s legacy. As a toddler, Sanders moved with his mother to Los Angeles, where he absorbed the rhythms of Compton, first as a DJ and beatboxer, before returning to Kansas for college, where he balanced basketball with his growing passion for jazz.[1][4][5][6][9]

Remarkably, Sanders did not begin playing drums until age 25, after earning degrees in communications and social work from the University of Kansas. Inspired by his grandmother and jazz historian Dick Wright, Sanders committed himself to mastering the instrument, practicing with the discipline he once reserved for sports. Within two years, he earned a place at Berklee College of Music, studying under jazz luminaries Joe Lovano and Bill Pierce, and performing with peers such as Christian Scott, Luques Curtis, and Warren Wolf. After relocating to New York City in 2004, Sanders led ensembles featuring future stars like Esperanza Spalding and Jon Batiste, all while maintaining a parallel career as a social worker and educator.[1][2][3][4]

Sanders’ musical style is rooted in swing, groove, and storytelling, aiming to connect deeply with listeners rather than showcase technical prowess. His discography includes 'Compton’s Finest' (2023), 'The Tables Will Turn' (2024), and 'Lasting Impression' (2025), each featuring an impressive roster of collaborators. Sanders is celebrated for his resilience, late-blooming artistry, and ability to bridge generations of jazz musicians, leaving a lasting impression on audiences and peers alike.[1][3][4][9]
