## Biography
Blind Willie McTell (born William Samuel McTier, May 5, 1898 – August 19, 1959) was a pioneering American Piedmont blues and ragtime singer, songwriter, and guitarist. Born in the Happy Valley community outside Thomson, Georgia, McTell was blind in one eye from birth and lost his remaining vision by late childhood. He attended schools for the blind in Georgia, New York, and Michigan, where he learned to read and write music in braille and developed proficiency on the harmonica, accordion, and, most notably, the guitar. His family was musically inclined, with both parents and an uncle playing guitar, and he was a cousin of gospel pioneer Thomas A. Dorsey.

McTell's career began in earnest after his mother's death in the 1920s, when he became an itinerant musician, performing on the streets and in traveling shows throughout Georgia and beyond. He made his first recordings in Atlanta for Victor Records in 1927, including the enduring classic "Statesboro Blues." McTell's fluid, syncopated fingerpicking style on the twelve-string guitar, combined with his smooth tenor voice, set him apart from his contemporaries. He recorded prolifically under various names for different labels throughout the 1920s and 1930s and continued to perform and record into the 1940s and 1950s, often with collaborator Curley Weaver. Despite never achieving major commercial success during his lifetime, McTell's work spanned blues, ragtime, gospel, and popular music, and he remained active as a performer until shortly before his death from a cerebral hemorrhage in 1959.

McTell's legacy is profound: his innovative guitar work and expressive songwriting influenced generations of musicians, particularly during the American folk and blues revival. He was posthumously inducted into the Blues Foundation's Blues Hall of Fame in 1981 and the Georgia Music Hall of Fame in 1990. Songs like "Statesboro Blues" have become standards, and his distinctive approach to the twelve-string guitar and the Piedmont blues style continues to inspire artists across genres.
