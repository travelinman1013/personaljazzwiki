## Biography
The Free Nationals are an American R&B band formed in Los Angeles, California, best known as Anderson .Paak’s live backing band. The group consists of José Ríos (lead guitar, backing vocals), Ron 'T.Nava' Avant (keyboard, rhythm guitar, backing vocals), Kelsey Gonzales (bass guitar, bass synth), and Callum Connor (drums, percussion, backing vocals). The band’s origins trace back to the late 2000s when Ríos and Avant met Anderson .Paak while studying at the Musicians Institute in Hollywood; Gonzales and Connor joined soon after, solidifying the lineup. Their name, inspired by mentor Shafiq Huisayn, reflects a sense of being 'indigenous to the music,' paying homage to influential musicians who came before them. The Free Nationals gained significant exposure through their performance with Paak at NPR’s Tiny Desk Concert in 2016, which has amassed over 104 million views. They released their self-titled debut album in 2019, featuring collaborations with artists like Daniel Caesar, Mac Miller, Kali Uchis, and Chronixx, and earned a Grammy nomination for Best Progressive R&B Album[1].

Chronixx, born Jamar Rolando McNaughton on October 10, 1992, in Spanish Town, Jamaica, is a leading figure in the modern 'Reggae Revival' movement. Raised in a musical family—his father, Chronicle, was a dancehall artist—Chronixx began writing songs as a child and started recording in his early teens. He attended St. Catherine High School and initially worked behind the scenes, harmonizing for artists like Lutan Fyah and producing rhythms for Popcaan and Konshens. His career took off after personal tragedies, including the death of his younger brother, which deepened his lyrical themes of resilience and social consciousness. Chronixx’s 2014 EP 'Dread & Terrible' and his 2017 album 'Chronology' both topped reggae charts and earned critical acclaim, with the latter nominated for a Grammy. His collaboration with the Free Nationals, 'Eternal Light,' marked his first RIAA gold certification in the US, a significant milestone for a Jamaican reggae artist[2][3][4]. Chronixx’s music blends roots reggae with contemporary influences, addressing themes of love, struggle, and empowerment, and he has become a global ambassador for Jamaican culture.
