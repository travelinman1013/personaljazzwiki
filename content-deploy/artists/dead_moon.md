## Biography
Dead Moon was a pioneering garage rock band formed in 1987 in Portland, Oregon, by Fred Cole (guitar, vocals), Kathleen 'Toody' Cole (bass, vocals), and Andrew Loomis (drums). The band emerged from the ashes of Fred and Toody's earlier projects, including The Rats, and was born out of a desire to create raw, stripped-down rock and roll that harkened back to the genre's roots. Their music blended elements of punk, garage, blues, and proto-punk, characterized by gritty production, impassioned vocals, and a DIY ethic that permeated every aspect of their career. Dead Moon self-released their music through their own label, Tombstone Records, and recorded much of their early work in their home studio, capturing a sound that was both intimate and ferocious.

Over nearly two decades, Dead Moon became a cornerstone of the Pacific Northwest underground scene, influencing countless bands with their relentless energy and independent spirit. Their dedication to authenticity and self-reliance set them apart, and they remained active until their breakup in 2006. After Dead Moon disbanded, Fred and Toody continued making music as Pierced Arrows, carrying forward the legacy of their earlier work. The band's impact endures, with their music continuing to inspire new generations of rock and punk musicians.

- Dead Moon's first gig was on September 17, 1987, and they played for only three people and the bartender.
