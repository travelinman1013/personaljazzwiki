## Biography

Eldridge Holmes (1942 – November 13, 1998) was a soul and R&B singer from Violet, Louisiana, near New Orleans. He began his recording career in the early 1960s when he was discovered and first recorded by the legendary New Orleans producer [[01_Projects/PersonalArtistWiki/Artists/Allen_Toussaint]]. Holmes's debut, 'Poor Me,' reflected the traditional New Orleans R&B style, but as his career progressed, he embraced a more contemporary soul and funk sound, often working closely with [[01_Projects/PersonalArtistWiki/Artists/Allen_Toussaint|Toussaint]] throughout the 1960s and into the 1970s.[1][3][4]

Despite his talent and the high quality of his recordings, Holmes never achieved significant commercial success, with none of his singles breaking into the national R&B charts. He recorded for a variety of labels, including Alon, Jet Set, Deesu, Sansu, and Atco, and was sometimes backed by the renowned funk band [[01_Projects/PersonalArtistWiki/Artists/The_Meters]]. Notable tracks include 'The Book,' 'Pop Popcorn Children,' and 'Gone, Gone, Gone.' Holmes was also a songwriter, penning several of his own releases. By the mid-1970s, he had largely retired from music, later working in various jobs outside the industry. He passed away in 1998, leaving behind a small but highly regarded body of work that has found renewed appreciation among collectors and Northern Soul enthusiasts.[1][2][4]

Holmes's musical style was marked by a blend of deep Southern soul, New Orleans R&B, and funk, characterized by his emotive vocals and rhythmic sensibility. His collaborations with [[01_Projects/PersonalArtistWiki/Artists/Allen_Toussaint]] and [[01_Projects/PersonalArtistWiki/Artists/The_Meters]] brought a distinctive Crescent City groove to his recordings. Though overlooked in his lifetime, Holmes’s music has since been recognized for its quality and influence, particularly within the Northern Soul scene, and his legacy endures through reissues and compilations.[2][4]

## Fun Facts
- Holmes’s single 'Pop Popcorn Children,' backed by The Meters, is considered a cult classic and is highly sought after by collectors.[2][4]
- He worked various jobs outside music, including as a bus driver, nursing assistant, asbestos worker, and mechanic after his recording career ended.[1][3]
- Despite his talent, Holmes never charted nationally, and many of his records were only local hits or remained obscure until rediscovered by soul enthusiasts.[1][2]
- A compilation of his work, 'Eldridge Holmes Deep Southern Soul,' was released in 2006 but was quickly withdrawn due to rights issues.[2]
