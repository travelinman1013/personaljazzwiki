## Biography
The Rolling Stones formed in London in 1962 when childhood friends Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, who reconnected at a Dartford train station in 1961 carrying blues records, joined forces with multi-instrumentalist Brian Jones. Inspired by Chicago blues artists, they debuted on July 12, 1962, at the Marquee Club as 'the Rollin' Stones,' named after a Muddy Waters track, with initial lineup including Jagger on vocals, Richards and Jones on guitar, Dick Taylor on bass, Ian Stewart on piano, and Mick Avory on drums. Early struggles included squalid living conditions, lineup changes with Bill Wyman joining on bass in December 1962 and Charlie Watts on drums in January 1963, leading to their first public performance as the recognizable quintet plus Stewart at the Flamingo Club.[1][2][3][6]

A residency at the Crawdaddy Club in 1963, promoted by Giorgio Gomelsky, built their following among students and attracted The Beatles, paving the way for manager Andrew Loog Oldham and a Decca Records deal. Their debut single, a Chuck Berry cover 'Come On,' released in June 1963, marked the start of hits, evolving from blues covers to Jagger-Richards originals like '(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction.' Their raw, energetic R&B style contrasted the Beatles' pop, embodying the dark side of 1960s counterculture during the British Invasion.[1][3][4][6]

Tragedy struck in 1969 when founder Brian Jones was ousted and drowned shortly after; Mick Taylor replaced him, ushering a golden era with albums like *Aftermath*. Ron Wood joined in 1975, while Wyman left in 1993, replaced by Darryl Jones. Known for blues-rooted rock, rebellious image, and longevity, they released *Hackney Diamonds* in 2023, their first original studio album in 18 years, cementing their legacy as rock icons.[1][3][4]
