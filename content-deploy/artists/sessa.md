## Biography
Sessa, born Sergio Sayeg in São Paulo, Brazil, is a singer-songwriter and guitarist deeply rooted in both the Brazilian and American music scenes. Growing up in São Paulo, he was immersed in Brazil’s rich musical traditions, absorbing the rhythms and melodies of MPB (Música Popular Brasileira), Tropicália, and bossa nova from an early age. His formative years were shaped by the sounds of Caetano Veloso, Tom Jobim, and the broader spectrum of Brazilian music, as well as the influence of American rock bands like The Stooges and MC5. Moving to New York in his late teens, Sessa broadened his musical horizons, collaborating with artists from diverse backgrounds and further refining his unique style.[2][3][7]

Sessa first gained recognition as a founding member of the São Paulo psych-funk band Garotas Suecas, and later as a collaborator with New York guitarist Yonatan Gat. His solo debut, 'Grandeza' (2019), drew critical acclaim for its minimalist arrangements, sensual Portuguese lyrics, and blending of Afro-Brazilian percussion with acoustic guitar and female choral harmonies. Sessa’s music is often described as intimate, enigmatic, and evocative, with a deliberate bareness reminiscent of Leonard Cohen, yet deeply rooted in the vibrant textures of Brazilian songwriting. His follow-up work, including 'Pequena Vertigem de Amor,' continues to explore the intersections of Brazilian sophistication and psychedelic soul, cementing his reputation as a leading voice in contemporary nova MPB.[1][2][3][4]

Sessa’s legacy is defined by his ability to channel the plurality of Brazilian culture into a sound that is both timeless and forward-thinking. His live performances, often accompanied by a female backing choir and Afro-Brazilian percussionists, are celebrated for their spiritual and sensual energy, offering new directions for Brazilian pop while honoring its storied past.[1][3]
