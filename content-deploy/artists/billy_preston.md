## Biography
Billy Preston was born William Everett Preston on September 2, 1946, in Houston, Texas, and raised in Los Angeles. A child prodigy, he began playing piano at age three and was performing with gospel legend Mahalia Jackson by age ten. His early exposure to gospel and R&B shaped his musical foundation, and by his teens, he was already recording solo albums such as '16 Year Old Soul' (1963) and 'The Most Exciting Organ Ever' (1965). Preston also portrayed the young W.C. Handy in the film 'St. Louis Blues' (1958), further cementing his reputation as a prodigious talent.[4]

Preston's career took off in the 1960s when he toured Europe with Little Richard's band and met the Beatles in Hamburg. He became a sought-after session musician, joining Ray Charles's backing band and later playing in the house band for the TV show 'Shindig.' His association with the Beatles led to his historic participation in the recording of 'Get Back,' which was credited to 'The Beatles with Billy Preston,' making him one of the few musicians to receive co-credit on a Beatles single. He also contributed to the albums 'Abbey Road' (1969) and 'Let It Be' (1970), including the band's iconic rooftop concert. Preston's solo career flourished with hits like 'Outa-Space' (1972, Grammy winner), 'Will It Go Round in Circles' (1973), and 'Nothing From Nothing' (1974), and he recorded for Apple, A&M, and Motown Records, scoring a major duet with Syreeta Wright on 'With You I'm Born Again' (1979).[1][2][3][4]

Preston's musical style blended R&B, soul, funk, rock, and gospel, characterized by his virtuosic keyboard work and soulful vocals. He was renowned for his innovative use of the Hammond organ and clavinet, and his energetic stage presence. As a consummate sideman, Preston worked with a 'Who's Who' of popular music, including the Rolling Stones, Eric Clapton, and The Band, leaving a lasting legacy as both a solo artist and a collaborator. His songwriting, notably co-writing 'You Are So Beautiful,' and his genre-crossing influence have made him a pivotal figure in 20th-century music.[1][2][3][4]
