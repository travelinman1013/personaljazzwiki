## Biography
Babs Gonzales (born Lee Brown on October 27, 1919 in Newark, New Jersey; died January 23, 1980) was an American bebop vocalist, writer, and hipster poet who became one of the most colorful figures on the modern jazz scene.[1][2][5][7] Raised in Newark, he studied piano at a young age and also learned drums, eventually turning to singing as his main outlet.[2][7] By the late 1930s he had begun moving in progressive jazz circles and, after early work including a 1939 sextet with Dizzy Gillespie, he went on to brief stints as a singer with the big bands of Charlie Barnet and Lionel Hampton in the 1940s.[1][2][4][5][7] When he moved to New York he encountered the emerging bebop style; initially baffled by Charlie Parker’s playing, he later said that it was Gillespie’s patient explanations of chords and melodic lines that opened up bebop for him and set his artistic direction.[1][3]

In 1946 Gonzales formed his own group, **Babs’ Three Bips and a Bop**, aiming to create a more audience‑friendly bridge to the new music.[1][2][3][5] The group recorded a string of 78s for Blue Note, Capitol, and Apollo through the late 1940s, featuring future jazz greats such as Tadd Dameron, Sonny Rollins, Roy Haynes, Wynton Kelly, and Bennie Green, and producing titles like “Oop‑Pop‑A‑Da,” “Weird Lullaby,” “Real Crazy,” “Professor Bop,” and “Prelude to a Nightmare.”[1][2][3][4][5] “Oop‑Pop‑A‑Da” in particular became his signature composition: its scat‑heavy vocal style was credited with suggesting a widely used route to vocal improvisation and was later turned into one of Gillespie’s first commercial successes.[1][2][5] Through the 1950s and 1960s Gonzales worked as both performer and behind‑the‑scenes facilitator—serving as road manager and vocalist for James Moody in the early 1950s, recording with organist Jimmy Smith and others, composing and arranging for instrumentalists such as Bennie Green and Johnny Griffin, and issuing his own albums like *Voila* and *Tales of Manhattan* with top‑flight jazz personnel.[2][5][6]

Stylistically, Gonzales was a pioneer of **vocalese** and bop‑based scat singing, fusing rapid‑fire, slang‑rich “street poetry” with complex bebop phrasing; his take on Charlie Parker’s “Ornithology” is often cited as a prime example.[1][5][6] He cultivated a distinctive hipster persona and invented vocabulary that led some writers to dub him an “inventor of the bebop language,” and he extended that voice into self‑published books and poetry as well as music.[1][6][7] From the early 1950s he made regular trips to Europe, performing and networking, and in 1962 he became one of the first American jazz musicians to play at Ronnie Scott’s club in London.[1][2][6] Back in New York he ran his own club, Babs’ Insane Asylum, in Sugar Hill, and continued linking musicians with each other and with record companies, even as he remained more of a cult figure than a mainstream star.[1][6][7] His legacy rests on his role as an energetic proselytizer for bebop, an innovator in jazz vocal language, and a connector whose recordings helped launch careers—most notably Sonny Rollins’ first studio sides—while his writings and larger‑than‑life personality documented and mythologized the bebop era from an insider’s perspective.[1][2][5][6][7]

## Fun Facts
- Gonzales claimed that when he first heard Charlie Parker, he “did not understand anything about bebop” until Dizzy Gillespie personally sat down with him to explain the chords and melodic lines, effectively giving him a crash course in the new music.[1][3]
- He ran a Harlem nightclub called **Babs’ Insane Asylum** on Sugar Hill (155th Street and St. Nicholas Place), a hangout for musicians and hipsters that reflected his offbeat sense of humor.[1]
- Trying to replicate his New York success in Europe, Gonzales invested about $10,000 to open a Paris club whimsically named **La Maison du Idiots**, but a general strike derailed the venture and he lost access to the investment.[1]
- Beyond music, he was a self‑published author and chronicler of the bebop world, writing idiosyncratic, slang‑filled books and poetry that cemented his reputation as a kind of “Boswell of bebop.”[1][6][7]

- [[james_moody|James Moody]] - Gonzales served as vocalist, road manager, and musical director, contributing original material and performances with the saxophonist’s band.

- [[jimmy_smith|Jimmy Smith]] - Collaborated on bop‑inflected organ sessions where Gonzales delivered his characteristic spoken‑sung hipster vocals. (Track “You Need Connections” with Jimmy Smith (organ), Thornel Schwartz (guitar), and Donald Bailey (drums) for Blue Note.) [Mid‑1950s (recorded 1956)[2][5][6]]
- [[johnny_griffin|Johnny Griffin]] - Worked with Gonzales both as a sideman and on Gonzales‑led projects, combining hard‑driving tenor sax with vocalese. (Appeared with Gonzales on the album *Voila* and other sessions; also collaborated on Blue Note recordings.) [Late 1950s[5][6]]
- [[bennie_green|Bennie Green]] - Trombonist for whom Gonzales wrote and arranged material and with whom he recorded as a guest vocalist. (Album *Soul Stirrin’* on Blue Note, plus Gonzales compositions and arrangements for Green’s bands.) [1950s (notably 1958)[2][5]]

### Artists Influenced
- [[sonny_rollins|Sonny Rollins]] - Gonzales led the sessions on which Rollins made his first recordings, providing early exposure and a professional platform. (Rollins’s debut recordings at a Capitol session in 1949 with Babs’ Three Bips and a Bop.) [1949[1][2]]
- [[dizzy_gillespie_as_interpreter_of_gonzaless_material|Dizzy Gillespie (as interpreter of Gonzales’s material)]] - Gillespie’s hit version of “Oop‑Pop‑A‑Da” spread Gonzales’s scat approach and hip lyric concept to a much wider jazz audience. (Dizzy Gillespie’s commercial recording of “Oop‑Pop‑A‑Da,” based on Gonzales’s original composition and vocal concept.) [Late 1940s[1][2][5]]
- [[subsequent_jazz_vocalists_and_scat_singers|Subsequent jazz vocalists and scat singers]] - Critics and historians credit Gonzales’s “Oop‑Pop‑A‑Da” and his bebop vocalese as pioneering an accessible route to vocal improvisation still used by many aspiring jazz singers. (Influence most clearly traced through later vocalese and scat practices inspired by “Oop‑Pop‑A‑Da” and his version of “Ornithology.”) [From late 1940s onward[1][5][6]]
