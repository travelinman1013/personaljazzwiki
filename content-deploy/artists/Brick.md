## Biography
Brick was an Atlanta-based funk band that emerged in 1975 from the fusion of two Atlanta area bands—one soul funk and one jazz funk. The original lineup consisted of Jimmy Brown (vocals, saxophone, flute, horns), Ray Ransom (vocals, bass, keyboards, percussion), Regi Hargis Hickman (vocals, guitar, bass), Eddie Irons (vocals, drums, keyboards), and Donald Nevins (keyboards). The group released their debut song "Music Matic" on Main Street Records in 1975 before signing with Bang Records in 1976, a local label with national distribution that would become their home for their most successful years.

Brick achieved breakthrough success with their 1976 single "Dazz," a term they coined to describe their signature fusion of disco and jazz. The song peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100 and topped the R&B charts, establishing their unique "dazz" sound. They continued their hot streak in 1977 with two more enormous hits, "Dusic" and "Ain't Gonna Hurt Nobody," both featuring chunky, propulsive beats and catchy light pop-jazz refrains. Between 1976 and 1982, Brick released six studio albums on Bang Records: Good High, Brick, Stoneheart, Waiting on You, Summer Heat, and After 5. Their collaboration with Ray Parker Jr. in 1981 produced "Sweat (Til You Get Wet)," their last Top Ten R&B hit.

The band's career extended beyond their Bang Records years, with their final studio album Too Tough released on Magic City Records in 1988 before the group split. By the time of their dissolution, Brick had achieved seven albums, two of which reached number one on the R&B charts, along with one top 10 pop hit and four top 10 R&B hits. Jimmy Brown later became known as the father of Sleepy Brown of Dungeon Family/Organized Noize fame. The band reunited in the 2010s, releasing a four-song EP titled Strong in December with all original members returning, featuring Jimmy Brown's children Jamaul Brown and Markesha Brown on vocals.
