## Biography
Connie Curtis Crayton, known as Pee Wee Crayton, was born on December 18, 1914, in Rockdale, Texas (raised in Austin or nearby Liberty Hill), where he began his musical journey playing a cigar box guitar, ukulele, and trumpet in school before seriously taking up guitar after moving to California in 1935. Settling in Oakland and later Los Angeles, he worked various jobs including as a janitor, chauffeur, and shipyard worker during World War II, while immersing himself in the Bay Area blues scene. There, he received direct tutelage from T-Bone Walker and jazz guitarist John Collins, developing a distinctive style that blended smooth jazz sophistication with hard-edged blues phrasing, aggressive picking, string bending, and innovative amplification techniques.[1][2][3][5][6][7]

## Fun Facts

- Leo Fender personally gave him a prototype Fender Stratocaster and amp, making him possibly the first blues guitarist to use one.[2][3][5]
- He supplemented income by teaching guitar and winning money on the golf course during lean years.[2]
- Died on June 25, 1985, shortly after a triumphant hometown return to Austin's Antone’s, honored by a 'Battle of the Blues Guitars' tribute.[2]
