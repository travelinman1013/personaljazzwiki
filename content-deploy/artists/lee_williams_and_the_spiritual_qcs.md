## Biography
Lee Williams & The Spiritual QC's, formed in Tupelo, Mississippi in 1968, are widely regarded as one of the most influential traditional gospel quartets of the modern era. Lee Williams, born July 28, 1946, began singing gospel at age seven, inspired and mentored by his uncle Mitchell Thornton, a member of the Gospel Stars. Williams and his brothers initially performed as the Gospel Stars Juniors before evolving into the Spiritual QC's, a group that would become synonymous with the revival of quartet gospel in the 1990s and 2000s.[2][3][1]

The group spent decades building their reputation locally, recording early singles for Designer Records in the 1970s and performing at churches and gospel programs throughout Mississippi. Williams balanced his music career with work as a truck driver, a testament to his perseverance. Their breakthrough came in the mid-1990s when their album 'Love Will Go All the Way' and the hit single 'I've Learned to Lean' propelled them to national fame. The Spiritual QC's became known for their powerful live performances, formal presentation, and Williams's stoic, soulful vocal style, which contrasted with the more animated gospel showmen of the time.[2][1][3]

Over their career, Lee Williams & The Spiritual QC's released numerous acclaimed albums, won multiple Stellar Awards, and were recognized with honors such as the James Cleveland Lifetime Achievement Award. Their legacy endures through their impact on gospel music, particularly in restoring the prominence of the quartet style and inspiring countless artists. Williams retired in 2018 after battling dementia, and the group celebrated over 50 years of ministry and music, leaving an indelible mark on the gospel landscape.[3][2]
