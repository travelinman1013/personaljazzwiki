## Biography
Queen Omega, born Jeneile Osborne in 1981 in San Fernando, Trinidad and Tobago, is a roots reggae and dancehall artist who has become a pioneering female voice in conscious reggae music. Encouraged by her mother from an early age, she began performing in local talent shows at nine years old, initially writing calypsos and performing soca music before discovering her true artistic calling in reggae and roots music. Raised in a musical family with influences ranging from soul legends like Aretha Franklin and Whitney Houston to traditional Trinidadian music, Queen Omega's artistic foundation was deeply shaped by her adoption of the Rastafarian faith, which inspired her shift toward reggae with spiritually conscious and socially aware lyrics.

Queen Omega's professional recording career began in the early 2000s when she met producer Mickey D at the Caribbean Music Expo in Jamaica in late 2000, leading to her relocation to London for recording sessions. She released her self-titled debut album "Queen Omega" in 2001 (with her first single "Warning" featuring Sizzla and Buju Banton released that same year), followed by "Pure Love" in 2003 and the critically acclaimed "Away From Babylon" in 2004. Throughout the 2000s and 2010s, she established herself as a global reggae ambassador, touring extensively across North America, Europe, Brazil, and the Caribbean, while collaborating with respected reggae musicians and receiving recognition including the Merlin Lynn Taitt Award for Music in 2012.

After a decade-long hiatus from major releases, Queen Omega returned in 2023 with the album "Freedom Legacy" on Baco Records, demonstrating her continued commitment to militant, empowering lyrics centered on women's liberation and human dignity. Her distinctive voice, precise conscious messaging, and ability to blend traditional roots reggae with modern influences have established her as a feminine icon in reggae history. Recent collaborations include work with producer Nathan Sabanayagam and the Naya Rockers on the 2025 single "Words of Wisdom," which showcases her enduring relevance in contemporary conscious reggae.

## Fun Facts
- Queen Omega adopted her stage name "Queen Omega" during her teenage years in Dominica as a reflection of her spiritual journey and commitment to empowering women through music, with 'Queen' symbolizing her royal essence and 'Omega' representing the end of one's search for truth and the beginning of a new spiritual chapter.
- Her debut single "Warning" featured two reggae heavyweights—Sizzla and Buju Banton—demonstrating her immediate credibility and connections within the reggae community despite being a relatively new artist at the time.
- The production of her 2025 single "Words of Wisdom" with Naya Rockers involved a truly global recording journey: the riddim foundation was recorded at Floki Studios in Haganesvik, Iceland (November 2022), her vocals were captured at Acoustic Live Studios in Trinidad (early 2023), and final mixing was completed at the legendary Tuff Gong Studios in Kingston, Jamaica.
- Queen Omega began her performance career at just nine years old, writing her own calypsos and even rapping on Trinidadian national television before eventually transitioning to reggae music.
