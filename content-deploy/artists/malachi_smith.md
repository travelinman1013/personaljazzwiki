## Biography
Malachi Smith is a renowned Jamaican dub poet, playwright, and performer, celebrated for his powerful blend of social commentary and reggae rhythms. Born in Westmoreland, Jamaica, and raised in Clarendon, St. Elizabeth, and St. Catherine, Smith began writing poetry at a young age, publishing his first works while still a student at White Marl Primary School. He later attended the Jamaica School of Drama and became a founding member of Poets in Unity, a pivotal group that helped bring dub poetry to the forefront of reggae music in the late 1970s and 1980s.

Smith’s career is marked by his unique dual role as both a police officer and an artist, a combination that has deeply influenced his work. After migrating to Florida in 1987, he continued to develop his craft, releasing several acclaimed albums such as 'Throw Two Punch' (1998), 'The Blacker the Berry, The Sweeter the Cherry' (2001), and 'Wiseman' (2017), where his poetry is performed with reggae accompaniment or a cappella. His work is characterized by its focus on social justice, love, nostalgia for Jamaica, and tributes to reggae icons, reflecting both personal and collective struggles. Smith has performed internationally, headlining festivals and sharing stages with notable artists, and has received numerous awards for his contributions to literature and music.

Beyond performance, Smith is also an educator and advocate for Caribbean arts. He is a fellow of the University of Miami’s Mitchner Caribbean Writers Institute, where he studied under luminaries like Lorna Goodison and Fred D’Aguilar. He has directed theatrical productions, founded the Jamaica Poets Nomadic College and School Tour, and continues to inspire new generations of poets and musicians through his masterclasses and community engagement.
