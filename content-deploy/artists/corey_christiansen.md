## Biography
Corey Christiansen is an American jazz guitarist, composer, and educator from Utah, widely recognized as one of the leading modern jazz guitarists of his generation.[2][4][7] Born and raised in Utah’s Cache Valley in a highly musical family, he began guitar studies at age five with his father, Mike Christiansen, who directed the guitar program at Utah State University for more than three decades.[1][5][7][8] He later completed his bachelor’s degree at Utah State University before moving to Florida to earn a master’s degree in music at the University of South Florida, supporting himself through intensive gigging and private teaching during his student years.[1][5]  

Christiansen first came to broad professional attention through his long association with Mel Bay Publications, where, after finishing graduate school, he worked as a clinician and eventually senior editor, touring extensively to give workshops, develop curricula, and produce instructional materials for guitar.[1][4] As a recording artist, he has released multiple albums on Origin Records and other labels, many of which explore a distinctive blend of modern jazz with rock, blues, and traditional American cowboy and frontier songs, drawing directly on his Western roots and the landscape and folklore of the American West.[1][2] His projects such as *Lone Prairie* and subsequent albums have been praised for reimagining Western and folk material in a contemporary jazz idiom, highlighting both his improvisational prowess and his focus on melody and narrative in instrumental music.[1][2]  

Alongside his performing and recording career, Christiansen has become an influential educator. He has taught at Utah State University—where he now runs the guitar program—and previously helped pioneer the jazz guitar program at Indiana University, working closely with the noted jazz educator and bandleader David Baker.[1][4] He is known for mentoring generations of students through university teaching, clinics, and online platforms such as the Corey Christiansen Modern Guitar Community, and he has been recognized with honors including a Grammy nomination and a Utah Arts & Museums individual artist fellowship for his work as a performer and composer.[2][3][4] His ongoing contributions as a performer, recording artist, and teacher have made him a central figure in contemporary jazz guitar with a particular role in shaping the musical identity and reputation of Utah on the national jazz scene.[2][4][8]
