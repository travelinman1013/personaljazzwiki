## Biography
Miguel Jontel Pimentel, born October 23, 1985, in San Pedro, California, is an acclaimed American singer-songwriter known for his innovative blend of contemporary and alternative R&B. Raised in a multicultural household with a Mexican-American father and African-American mother, Miguel was exposed to a wide range of musical genres including funk, hip hop, jazz, classic rock, and R&B from an early age. He began writing and recording his own songs as a teenager, working at a local production company and signing his first record deal at age 19.

Miguel's professional breakthrough came after signing to Jive Records in 2007, following an initial stint with the independent label Black Ice. His debut album, 'All I Want Is You' (2010), was a sleeper hit, propelled by singles like 'Sure Thing' and 'Quickie.' The album's success established him as a rising star in R&B. His sophomore effort, 'Kaleidoscope Dream' (2012), debuted at No. 3 on the Billboard 200 and featured the Grammy-winning single 'Adorn,' earning widespread critical acclaim and comparisons to Marvin Gaye and Prince. Subsequent albums, 'Wildheart' (2015) and 'War & Leisure' (2017), saw Miguel further experiment with psychedelic, rock, and electronic influences, solidifying his reputation for genre-blending artistry.

Miguel's legacy is marked by his ability to fuse diverse musical styles and his impact on modern R&B. His work is characterized by sensual vocals, introspective lyrics, and a willingness to push creative boundaries. He has received numerous accolades, including a Grammy Award and multiple Soul Train Music Awards, and continues to influence the sound and direction of contemporary R&B.
