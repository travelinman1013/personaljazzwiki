## Biography
Leslie Feist, born on February 13, 1976, in Amherst, Nova Scotia, Canada, was raised in Regina and Calgary, Alberta. She began her music career as a teenager in the punk band Placebo (not the British band), serving as lead vocalist; the group won a local battle of the bands and opened for the Ramones in 1991, touring Canada for five years until she suffered voice damage requiring a hiatus. Moving to Toronto in 1998, she took up guitar, joined By Divine Right as guitarist in 1999, and released her debut solo album Monarch (Lay Your Jewelled Head Down) that year, funded by a Canadian government grant.[1][3]

Feist's career accelerated through key collaborations: she roomed with Peaches and Gonzales in 2000, contributing vocals to The Teaches of Peaches and Presidential Suite, and became a founding member of Broken Social Scene, appearing on Feel Good Lost and You Forgot It in People. Relocating to Paris, she recorded her breakthrough album Let It Die (2004), blending jazz and bossa nova, which earned two Juno Awards and international acclaim. Follow-up albums like The Reminder (2007, four Grammy nominations, Polaris Prize winner via Metals), Metals (2011), and Multitudes (2023, Juno for Best Adult Alternative Album) solidified her as a 14-time Juno winner known for compelling vocals and songwriting.[1][2][3]

Feist's style evolved from punk roots to sophisticated indie pop with jazz, bossa nova, and alternative influences, often compared to Ella Fitzgerald or Norah Jones. Her legacy includes gold-certified releases, appearances on Saturday Night Live and Sesame Street, and critical praise from Pitchfork, NPR, and The New York Times, marking her as one of Canada's most acclaimed artists.[1][2]
