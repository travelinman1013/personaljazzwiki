## Biography
The New Orleans Rhythm Kings (NORK) were a pioneering jazz band formed in Chicago in 1922, though their founding members hailed from New Orleans. Originally assembled to play at the Friars Inn club under the name Friars Society Orchestra, the group included Paul Mares (cornet), George Brunies (trombone), Leon Roppolo (clarinet), Elmer Schoebel (piano), Jack Pettis (saxophone), Lou Black (banjo), Steve Brown (string bass), and Frank Snyder (drums)[1][2][3]. Their early recordings at the Richmond Gennett studio marked a significant evolution in jazz, emphasizing sophisticated arrangements and solo improvisation, a departure from the ensemble-heavy style of earlier New Orleans bands[3][4].

The band changed its name to the New Orleans Rhythm Kings in 1923, after losing their Friars Inn gig, and continued to record influential tracks such as "Tin Roof Blues" and "Wolverine Blues"[1][4]. Their 1923 sessions with Jelly Roll Morton were groundbreaking, producing some of the first racially integrated jazz recordings, including "Sobbin' Blues"[2][3][6]. NORK's smooth, swinging style and focus on individual solos set them apart from contemporaries like the Original Dixieland Jazz Band, and their work became a template for future jazz ensembles[3][4].

Though the band dissolved in 1925 when Mares left music, their legacy endured. NORK's recordings influenced generations of jazz musicians, and their innovative approach to arrangement and improvisation helped shape the development of jazz in Chicago and beyond[1][2][3].
