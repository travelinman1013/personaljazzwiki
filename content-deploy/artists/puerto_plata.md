## Biography
José Cobles, known professionally as **Puerto Plata**, was born on August 4, 1923, in the resort town of Puerto Plata in the Dominican Republic.[1][4] He grew up in a musical family, with three uncles who were musicians, and spent his childhood surrounded by legends of Dominican music including composer Juan Lockward and singer Eduardo Brito.[1] After his grandmother's death when he was 16, Cobles worked as a carpenter for the United Fruit Company, which took him to Manzanillo, Panama, and eventually to Santiago in the Dominican Republic at age 27, where he earned the nickname "Puerto Plata" in honor of his hometown.[1] He purchased his first guitar at age 24 for 20 Dominican pesos, which he had saved penny by penny in a shoebox, giving himself 62 years of practice before achieving his current mastery.[1]

Settling in the barrio of La Joya in Santiago—a storied neighborhood known as the center of popular culture and home to famous musicians and performers—Cobles formed the Trio Primavera with singer Daniel Rodriguez and guitarist Ernesto Almonte.[1] For many years, he performed son and bolero regularly at "El Arbolito," a cabaret across from the matadero, often playing four or five serenades a night on weekends.[1] However, from 1931 to 1961, the Trujillo dictatorship stifled the Dominican music climate, and pre-bachata guitar musicians like Puerto Plata were rarely heard outside the countryside despite their popularity.[1] Dominican son became relegated to the streets and patios of Santiago, San Pedro, and Santo Domingo, remaining an informal, rarely recorded music.[1]

At age 84 in 2007, Puerto Plata launched his critically acclaimed debut album, **"Mujer de Cabaret,"** which takes listeners back to the golden age of Dominican guitar music through its sones, boleros, and merengues.[1] His second album, **"Casita de Campo,"** was released on September 1, 2009, featuring classic love songs and dance numbers composed during the Trujillo regime.[1] Since his 2007 debut, Puerto Plata has toured throughout the USA and Europe, and currently resides in Denver, Colorado, close to his family and grandchildren.[1]
