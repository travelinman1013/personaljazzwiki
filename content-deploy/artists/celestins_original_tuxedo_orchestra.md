## Biography
Celestin's Original Tuxedo Orchestra was founded in 1910 by Oscar "Papa" Celestin, a Creole musician born in Napoleonville, Louisiana, in 1884. Raised in a working-class family, Celestin spent his youth laboring on sugar plantations before saving enough money as a railway cook to pursue music, initially playing guitar and trombone before settling on the cornet. After moving to New Orleans in 1906, he immersed himself in the vibrant local music scene, performing with bands such as the Excelsior Brass Band and the Imperial Band, and collaborating with legendary figures like Joe "King" Oliver and Jelly Roll Morton[2][3][4].

Celestin's leadership and charismatic stage presence earned him the position of bandleader at the Tuxedo Dance Hall, where his ensemble became known as the Original Tuxedo Orchestra. The group quickly gained prominence for its infectious dance music and open-minded hiring practices, including employing women pianists and building a diverse following across racial and social lines. The orchestra was among the first jazz bands to record in New Orleans, producing notable tracks like "My Josephine" in the 1920s. Despite setbacks during the Great Depression, Celestin revived the band after World War II, leading it through the 1950s jazz revival and performing regularly on Bourbon Street until his death in 1954[2][3][4].

Musically, the Original Tuxedo Orchestra was rooted in ragtime and early New Orleans jazz, blending syncopated rhythms, lively brass, and ensemble improvisation. Celestin's band played a pivotal role in shaping the sound and culture of New Orleans jazz, influencing generations of musicians and leaving a legacy that endures through the continued performances of the Original Tuxedo Jazz Band more than a century after its founding[2][3].
