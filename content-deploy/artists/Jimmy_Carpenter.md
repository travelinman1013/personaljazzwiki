## Biography
Jimmy Carpenter, born in Greensboro, North Carolina, is a celebrated saxophonist, singer-songwriter, and arranger whose career spans over four decades[1][6]. He began his musical journey in the 1980s, touring the East Coast with The Alka-Phonics, a renegade blues band, and later with The Believers, a blues-rock outfit that provided him valuable experience in the music business[2][9]. Carpenter's dynamic style blends blues, soul, R&B, and rock-n-roll, earning him a reputation for high-energy performances and soulful horn arrangements[1][3].

In the 1990s and 2000s, Carpenter became a sought-after collaborator, touring internationally with renowned artists such as Tinsley Ellis, Jimmy Thackery, Walter "Wolfman" Washington, Eric Lindell, and Mike Zito[2][3][5]. He spent many years in New Orleans, where he contributed to the city's vibrant music scene and won a Grammy for co-writing a tune on The New Orleans Nightcrawlers’ album "Atmosphere"[3][5]. Since relocating to Las Vegas in 2015, Carpenter has fronted his own quartet at the Sand Dollar Lounge, served as President of the Las Vegas Blues Society, and acted as Musical Director for The Big Blues Bender festival[1][3][5].

Carpenter’s discography includes six critically acclaimed solo albums, with recent releases such as "Just Got Started" (2024), "The Louisiana Record" (2022), and "Soul Doctor" (2019), all on Gulf Coast Records[3][5]. His artistry has been recognized with multiple Blues Music Award nominations and wins for Best Instrumentalist/Horn in 2021 and 2022[3][7]. Carpenter’s legacy lies in his ability to bridge genres, mentor younger musicians, and elevate the contemporary blues scene through both his performances and organizational leadership.
