## Biography
Junie Cobb's Hometown Band was led by Junius C. "Junie" Cobb, an influential American jazz multi-instrumentalist and bandleader born in Hot Springs, Arkansas, on December 31, 1896. Cobb began his musical journey with piano lessons from his mother at age nine and soon became proficient on a wide array of instruments, including clarinet, saxophone, banjo, piano, violin, and drums. As a teenager, he played piano in Johnny Dunn's band before moving to Chicago, where he led his own ensemble at the Club Alvadere in the early 1920s.

In the 1920s, Cobb played banjo with King Oliver and Jimmie Noone, two of the era's most prominent jazz figures, and began recording as a leader with his own groups, including Junie Cobb's Hometown Band. His band featured top musicians of the Chicago jazz scene and recorded for labels like Vocalion and Victor. Cobb's career included a stint in Paris in the early 1930s, after which he returned to Chicago to lead various groups, perform as a solo pianist, and collaborate with artists such as Annabelle Calhoun. He continued performing into the 1960s, contributing to the legacy of early jazz through his versatility and leadership.

Cobb's musical style was rooted in early jazz and swing, marked by his multi-instrumental prowess and his ability to lead ensembles featuring some of the best musicians of his time. His compositions, such as "Once or Twice," and his recordings with his Hometown Band remain significant documents of the Chicago jazz tradition. Cobb's influence extended through his collaborations and mentorship, helping to shape the sound of American jazz in the first half of the 20th century.
