## Biography
Pitney Meyer is a Nashville-based bluegrass duo formed in spring 2023 by singer-songwriter and guitarist Mo Pitney and banjo player John Meyer. The collaboration emerged from an enduring friendship rooted in their shared bluegrass heritage and years of musical connection. Mo Pitney, born Morgan Daniel Pitney on March 24, 1993, in Cherry Valley, Illinois, began his musical journey at age 6 with drums and switched to guitar at 12, performing in bluegrass bands with his brother and friends throughout his youth. John Meyer, originally from Missouri, came from a large musical family and received a banjo as a young child, never setting it down since. The two first met at an IBMA (International Bluegrass Music Association) convention in Nashville approximately fifteen years before forming their duo, where they immediately connected through jam sessions. Their friendship deepened through family bluegrass festival circuits and eventually led to front-porch jam sessions after both relocated to Nashville, which evolved into a sold-out residency at the iconic Station Inn.

Pitney Meyer's debut album, "Cherokee Pioneer," released on April 18, 2025, represents the culmination of their collaborative vision and establishes them firmly within bluegrass tradition. Recorded directly to analog tape in a 19th-century cabin in rural Tennessee once owned by Johnny Cash, the album features top-notch songwriting, masterful picking, and spot-on harmonies from an array of all-star musicians. The album explores themes of Native American history, particularly the Trail of Tears, alongside traditional bluegrass storytelling and gospel numbers. The duo's musical approach honors traditional bluegrass while incorporating contemporary songwriting sensibilities, with Mo Pitney drawing influences from country legends like Ray Price, Buck Owens, Roger Miller, and Merle Haggard, as well as bluegrass pioneers J.D. Crowe and Del McCoury.

Mo Pitney's solo career, which preceded the formation of Pitney Meyer, established him as a respected artist in country and bluegrass circles. Signed to Curb Records in May 2014, he released two studio albums: "Behind This Guitar" (2016), which charted at No. 10 on Billboard's Top Country Albums, and "Ain't Lookin' Back" (2020). His work has garnered recognition from major publications, earning him "Artist To Watch" designations from Rolling Stone, Billboard, and The Bobby Bones Show, with over 36 million streams accumulated across his catalog. The formation of Pitney Meyer represents a natural evolution for both musicians, allowing them to explore their bluegrass roots more deeply while maintaining their individual artistic identities.
