## Biography
SBTRKT is the electronic music project of Aaron Jerome, a producer and DJ born in London, England, though he spent part of his childhood on a farm in rural England, shaped by a multicultural heritage that traces through East Africa, India, and Scotland[1][2][5]. Jerome’s early exposure to diverse cultures and subcultures—his mother’s Goan, Kenyan, and Portuguese roots, and his father’s Scottish farming ancestry—imbued his music with a sense of cultural ambiguity and global perspective[2][5]. He began his career as a DJ in London’s underground club scene, notably at Plastic People, and gained attention in the late 2000s through remixes for artists like Radiohead, M.I.A., Basement Jaxx, and Franz Ferdinand[1][4]. His 2011 self-titled debut album, featuring collaborations with Jessie Ware and Sampha, was critically acclaimed and established him as a leading figure in UK electronic music, known for blending genres and pioneering a masked, enigmatic stage persona[1][3]. Jerome’s subsequent albums—2014’s 'Wonder Where We Land' and 2016’s 'Save Yourself'—further showcased his genre-fluid approach and willingness to tackle sociopolitical themes, while his 2023 comeback, 'The Rat Road,' marked a more personal and unmasked phase, reflecting on identity, artistic reinvention, and the pressures of the music industry[1][2][5]. Throughout his career, SBTRKT has been celebrated for his innovative production, dynamic live shows, and ability to collaborate across musical boundaries.

## Fun Facts
- SBTRKT and his collaborators originally performed live wearing tribal masks, a signature visual element that contributed to the project’s mystique, though Jerome later abandoned the masks to embrace a more personal artistic identity[1][3].
- Jerome is largely self-taught as a producer and estimates he created over 2,000 songs during a seven-year hiatus between albums[2].
- His multicultural upbringing—spanning rural England, Kenya, India, and Scotland—deeply informs his music and worldview, setting him apart from more typical British South-Asian narratives[2][5].
- Despite his music career, Jerome has also worked as a copywriter for an electricity company[6].
