## Biography
The Basin Street Six was a prominent Dixieland jazz group formed in 1950 in New Orleans, Louisiana, at a time when traditional jazz was experiencing a revival in the city. The original lineup included George Girard (trumpet), Joe Rotis (trombone), Pete Fountain (clarinet), Roy Zimmerman (piano), Bunny Franks (bass), and Charlie Duke (drums). The group quickly became known for their energetic performances, playful stage antics, and commitment to the classic New Orleans jazz sound, often performing in Mardi Gras costumes and engaging audiences with humor and showmanship.

The band found early success performing at local venues such as L'Enfants on Canal Boulevard and the Silver Slipper Club on Bourbon Street, and they soon became a staple of the burgeoning Dixieland revival. Their popularity was boosted by regular radio and television appearances, including broadcasts on WWL Radio and TV, which helped them reach a national audience. The Basin Street Six recorded for Circle and Mercury Records, producing a number of singles and LPs that captured the lively spirit of their live shows. Although the group underwent several personnel changes and eventually disbanded, its members, particularly Pete Fountain and George Girard, went on to have influential careers in jazz. The Basin Street Six is remembered for its role in revitalizing Dixieland jazz in the postwar era and for launching the careers of some of New Orleans' most celebrated musicians.
