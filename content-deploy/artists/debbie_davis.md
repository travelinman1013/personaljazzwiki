## Biography
Debbie Davies, born on August 22, 1952, in Los Angeles, California, grew up immersed in music due to her professional musician parents who filled the home with big band jazz, harmony vocal groups, pop, and especially her father's Ray Charles records, sparking her early affinity for blues. By age 12, she shifted from piano to guitar, defying 1960s gender norms that relegated electric guitars to boys; she was captivated by British blues-rock, particularly Eric Clapton's playing with John Mayall’s Bluesbreakers. She honed her skills in blues and rock 'n' roll bands in the San Francisco Bay Area before returning to Los Angeles in 1984.[1][2][3]

In 1985, Davies joined Maggie Mayall and the Cadillacs as lead guitarist, an all-female R&B band led by John Mayall's wife, and later contributed to John Mayall’s 1990 album *A Sense of Place*. In 1988, Albert Collins recruited her for his Icebreakers, where she toured for three years, appearing on their 1991 Grammy-nominated self-titled album and gaining profound insights into the blues world. She then became lead guitarist for Fingers Taylor and the Ladyfingers Revue, opening for Jimmy Buffett’s 1991 “Outpost” tour, before launching her solo career with *Picture This* in 1993 on Blind Pig Records, featuring Collins. A professional since the early 1980s, she has released multiple albums, including the all-instrumental *Holdin’ Court* in 2009, and earned ten Blues Music Award nominations, winning Best Contemporary Female Blues Artist in 1997 and 2010, plus the Koko Taylor Award.[1][2][3]

Davies' muscular electric guitar style, songwriting, and powerful vocals have established her as a leading contemporary blues artist and pioneer for female guitarists, with over 30 years on the road blending blues-rock influences into her dynamic performances.[1][3]
