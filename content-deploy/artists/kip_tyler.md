## Biography
Kip Tyler, born Elwood Westerton Smith on May 31, 1929 in Chicago, Illinois, was a pioneering American rock and roll singer and bongo player whose energetic style helped shape the West Coast rockabilly scene of the late 1950s. Tyler began his musical journey as the lead singer of The Sleepwalkers during his time at Union High School, later joining forces with rival musicians from Fairfax High School to form the early incarnation of Kip Tyler and the Flips[1][2][4]. His dynamic stage presence, often featuring black leather and a motorcycle, quickly made him a local favorite, especially at the legendary El Monte Legion Stadium where his band became a staple act[2][5].

In 1957, Tyler's career took a significant turn when arranger Joseph Gershenson recruited him for a project connected to the film "Rock, Pretty Baby." Tyler provided the voice for the movie's main character, Jimmy Daley, and subsequently adopted the persona to form Jimmy Daley and the Ding-A-Lings, recording his first album at Decca Records[1][2][4]. Despite early promise, the sequel "Summer Love" faltered, prompting Tyler to return to his own name and form Kip Tyler and the Flips. The group released several singles, including "Jungle Hop" (later covered by The Cramps), "She's My Witch," and "Let's Monkey Around," which showcased his raw, driving rockabilly sound[1][2][4].

After the Flips disbanded in 1959, Tyler pursued a solo career with limited success, releasing his final single in 1965. Though he largely avoided discussing his rock 'n' roll days in later years, Tyler's influence on the California rockabilly scene was substantial, with several of his bandmates going on to become prominent session musicians. He passed away on September 23, 1996 in Los Angeles, California[1][2][4].
