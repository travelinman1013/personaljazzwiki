## Biography
Charles Christopher Parker Jr., known as Charlie Parker or 'Bird,' was born on August 29, 1920, in Kansas City, Kansas, and raised in Kansas City, Missouri, a city renowned for its vibrant jazz scene during the Prohibition era[1][2][3]. His early exposure to music came from his father, a pianist, dancer, and singer, and the lively local clubs where he spent much of his youth[1][3]. Parker began playing the saxophone at age 11, joined his high school band at 14, and by 15 had dropped out of school to pursue music full-time, immersing himself in the local jazz scene[1][2][3]. Despite an early setback—being kicked off the stage during a jam session with Count Basie’s Orchestra for failing to improvise—Parker used the experience as motivation to refine his craft, eventually developing a revolutionary approach to jazz improvisation[1].

Parker’s career breakthrough came in the early 1940s when he moved to New York and, alongside Dizzy Gillespie, pioneered bebop—a complex, fast-paced style marked by advanced harmonies and virtuosic improvisation[1][3][4]. His technical mastery and innovative harmonic concepts, such as rapid chord changes and substitutions, redefined jazz and influenced generations of musicians[3][5]. Despite his musical genius, Parker struggled with drug and alcohol addiction, which contributed to his untimely death at age 34 on March 12, 1955[1][2][4]. His legacy endures through annual music festivals, numerous awards, and his enduring influence on jazz and beyond[1][4].

## Fun Facts
- Parker earned the nickname 'Bird' (or 'Yardbird') early in his career; the origin is debated, but one story claims it came from his love of eating chicken[1][3].
- Despite his short life, Parker composed jazz standards such as 'Confirmation,' 'Anthropology,' and 'Ko-Ko,' which remain essential repertoire for jazz musicians[3][4].
- The famous New York jazz club Birdland was named in Parker’s honor in 1949, a testament to his impact on the scene[4].
- Parker’s struggles with addiction were so severe that a coroner mistakenly estimated his age at death to be between 50 and 60, not realizing he was only 34[3].
