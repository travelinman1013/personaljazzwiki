## Biography
Joan Osborne is an acclaimed American singer-songwriter known for her powerful, soulful voice and her versatility across genres such as rock, blues, and folk. Born in Anchorage, Kentucky, Osborne rose to prominence with her 1995 debut album 'Relish,' which featured the Grammy-nominated hit 'One of Us.' Over her three-decade career, Osborne has built a reputation as both a compelling songwriter and one of her generation’s finest interpreters, particularly recognized for her reinterpretations of classic songs and artists.

In recent years, Osborne has focused on the music of Bob Dylan, releasing the critically acclaimed 'Songs of Bob Dylan' in 2017 and following up with 'Dylanology Live' in 2025. This live album, recorded with a stellar band and special guests including Amy Helm, Robert Randolph, and Jackie Greene, showcases Osborne’s ability to breathe new life into Dylan’s catalog with inventive arrangements and emotive performances. The project highlights her collaborative spirit and her ongoing relevance in the American roots music scene.

Amy Helm, daughter of Levon Helm of The Band, is a respected singer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist in her own right, known for her work with the roots group Ollabelle and her solo career. Robert Randolph, a virtuoso pedal steel guitarist, is celebrated for his energetic blend of gospel, funk, and rock, leading the Family Band and collaborating with a wide range of artists. Their participation in 'Dylanology Live' underscores the interconnectedness of the Americana and roots music communities, with each artist bringing their unique influences and talents to the project.
