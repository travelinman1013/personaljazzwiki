## Biography
Joe Krown is a New Orleans-based keyboardist and Hammond B-3 organist born on March 26 in Baltimore, Maryland, though his family relocated to Westbury, Long Island, New York when he was an infant.[7] He began taking piano lessons at age six and honed his keyboard skills throughout his youth and college years at the State University of New York at Buffalo.[6][7] In the 1980s, before relocating to New Orleans, Krown established himself as a versatile session musician in the Northeast, joining Chuck Berry's band and providing keyboard accompaniment for legendary vocal groups including the Platters and the Marvellettes.[2][3]

Krown moved to New Orleans in 1992 and quickly became a first-call organist and pianist in the city's vibrant music scene.[1] From 1992 to 2005, he held the keyboard chair with Clarence "Gatemouth" Brown & Gate's Express, appearing on chart-topping albums including "The Man," "Gate Swings," "American Music Texas Style," and "Back to Bogalusa."[1] A significant career highlight occurred in 1995 when Krown and Gate's Express served as the opening act for Eric Clapton on a 62-date world tour.[1] Between September 1996 and June 2001, Krown occupied the prestigious Traditional Piano Night slot at the Maple Leaf Bar in New Orleans, a position previously held by jazz legends Professor Longhair and James Booker.[1] He founded the Joe Krown Organ Combo in 1999, which has performed extensively at major festivals including the French Quarter Festival, New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, and the Ottawa Blues Fest, while also maintaining regular performances at New Orleans venues such as the House of Blues, Tipitina's, and dba.[1]

Krown's discography as a leader includes "Just the Piano...Just the Blues" (1998), "New Orleans Piano Rolls" (2003), and multiple albums with the Joe Krown Organ Combo: "Down & Dirty" (1999), "Buckle Up" (2000), "Funkyard" (2002), and "Livin' Large" (2005).[1] In 2004, he joined New Orleans Juice, a premier national touring funk act, and appeared on their 2005 double live CD "Hey Buddy."[1] His 2007 release "Old Friends" with the Joe Krown Trio, featuring vocalist and guitarist Brint Anderson and drummer Mike Barras, represented a mix of traditional New Orleans favorites and original compositions.[1] Krown won a New Orleans Big Easy Award in the Blues category in April 2001 and has been nominated twice for this honor.[4] As a Hammond endorsed artist, he remains an integral part of the Hammond artist family and continues to represent the authentic New Orleans funk, blues, and R&B tradition.[8]
