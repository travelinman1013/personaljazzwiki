## Biography
Crazy P is an English electronic music group formed in 1995 by Chris Todd (aka Hot Toddy) and Jim Baron (aka Ron Basejam), who met at Nottingham University.[1][2] The duo began as bedroom producers, utilizing an Atari computer and Akai S-Series sampler to experiment with house, disco, and soul records they had collected.[2] Originally named Crazy Penis—derived from an obscure late-1980s house record called "Loco Pinga"—the group released their debut single "The Way We Swing" in 1997 on the Manchester-based label Paper Recordings, followed by their instrumental and sample-driven debut album A Nice Hot Bath With… in 1999.[1][2]

The group's sound underwent a significant transformation when Danielle Moore joined as lead vocalist around 2002, bringing a greater pop sensibility and female vocal presence to their music.[1][2] This lineup expansion coincided with the recruitment of bassist Tim Davies and percussionist Matt Klose, establishing Crazy P as a full live band.[1][2] Between 2002 and 2008, they released four albums—The Wicked Is Music (2002), 24 Psychedelic Freakout (2003), and A Night on Earth (2004)—that gained them international acclaim, record sales, and DJ bookings across the world, from Australian outdoor festivals to East London basement venues.[1] In 2008, the band officially shortened their name from Crazy Penis to Crazy P and signed with the prestigious house label 2020 Vision, releasing Stop Space Return, which marked a creative turning point where they prioritized artistic self-expression over commercial compromise.[1][2][3]

Throughout the 2010s and beyond, Crazy P continued to refine their distinctive blend of lushly structured songs and live power, releasing albums including When We On (2011), Walk Dance Talk Sing (2015), and Age of the Ego (2019).[2] The group became known for their energetic live performances, extensive remix work, and multiple international tours, including support slots for legendary artists like Chic and Chaka Khan.[2] Their music, rooted in vintage disco, soul, and house traditions, has maintained relevance across generations of club culture, with their catalogue reflecting a consistent commitment to artistic integrity and collaborative trust.[3]

## Fun Facts
- The band's original name 'Crazy Penis' was derived from an obscure late-1980s house record called 'Loco Pinga,' and they chose the English translation specifically for shock value.[2]
- Crazy P's breakthrough came when their track 'There's A Better Place' was picked up by Australian National radio station Triple J, which expanded their reach from small 250-capacity UK venues to 1000-1500 capacity venues in Australia.[3]
- In 2008, the band made a deliberate creative decision to prioritize artistic self-expression over commercial success, rejecting lucrative offers to become 'the next Groove Armada' and instead committing to writing music they loved on their own terms.[3]
- The band has maintained a significant fan base in Australia, undertaking three separate tours there and becoming equally comfortable performing on huge outdoor festival stages as in basement venues across East London.[1]
