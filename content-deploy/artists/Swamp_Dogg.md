## Biography
Swamp Dogg, born Jerry Williams Jr. on July 12, 1942, in Portsmouth, Virginia, is a pioneering American singer, songwriter, and record producer known for his genre-defying blend of country soul, R&B, and funk. Raised in a musical family on the only Black block of Duke Street, Williams was exposed early to a vibrant community of traveling Black musicians, which deeply influenced his musical ambitions. He began recording as a child prodigy under the names Little Jerry and Little Jerry Williams in the 1950s and 1960s, achieving modest success with soul singles and songwriting for other artists.

In 1970, frustrated with the constraints of the mainstream music industry, Williams reinvented himself as Swamp Dogg, debuting the persona with the album 'Total Destruction to Your Mind.' This new identity allowed him to embrace a more satirical, politically charged, and experimental style, drawing inspiration from the radical politics and psychedelic culture of the late 1960s. Swamp Dogg’s music became known for its irreverent humor, subversive lyrics, and willingness to tackle themes of race, social justice, and personal struggle, all anchored by deep Southern soul grooves. Although initially overlooked by the mainstream, his work developed a cult following and has been retrospectively celebrated for its originality and influence.

Throughout his career, Swamp Dogg has released dozens of albums, written and produced for a wide range of artists, and remained an enduring outsider figure in American music. His legacy is marked by his fearless innovation, boundary-pushing artistry, and a discography that continues to inspire new generations of musicians and fans.
