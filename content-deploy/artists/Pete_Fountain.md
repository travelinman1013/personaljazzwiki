## Biography
Pete Fountain, born Pierre Dewey LaFontaine, Jr. on July 3, 1930, in New Orleans, Louisiana, was a celebrated American clarinetist renowned for his contributions to jazz, Dixieland, and swing music. As a child, Fountain suffered from chronic respiratory ailments, and on a doctor's advice, his father bought him a clarinet to strengthen his lungs—a decision that would shape his life and career. By his teens, Fountain was already performing regularly in New Orleans nightclubs, playing alongside phonograph records of jazz greats like Benny Goodman and Irving Fazola to hone his craft.

Fountain's career blossomed in the vibrant New Orleans jazz scene, where he played with bands such as Monk Hazel's and co-founded the Basin Street Six with trumpeter George Girard in 1950. After a stint with the Dukes of Dixieland in Chicago, he returned to New Orleans and formed a band with Al Hirt. His national fame soared when he joined the Lawrence Welk Orchestra in Los Angeles, becoming a household name through his featured solos on 'The Lawrence Welk Show.' After leaving Welk's orchestra in 1959, Fountain returned to New Orleans, opened his own jazz club, and recorded over 40 albums, many of which became bestsellers and helped popularize Dixieland jazz across America.

Fountain's warm, lyrical clarinet style and commitment to New Orleans traditions made him a beloved figure in American music. His legacy endures through his recordings, his influence on generations of jazz musicians, and his role in keeping the spirit of New Orleans jazz alive for audiences worldwide.
