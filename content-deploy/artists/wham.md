## Biography
Wham! was a British pop duo formed in 1981 by Andrew Ridgeley and George Michael, who had met as schoolmates and discovered an immediate creative and personal connection.[2] The pair emerged during the early 1980s as one of the most successful pop acts of the decade, selling more than 30 million certified records worldwide between 1982 and 1986.[2] George Michael served as the lead vocalist, primary songwriter, and keyboardist, while Ridgeley contributed as co-writer, guitarist, and backing vocalist. Their breakthrough came after they approached various record labels with a homemade demo tape recorded in Ridgeley's living room, eventually signing with Innervision Records and later Epic Records/CBS.[2]

Wham! achieved unprecedented international success, becoming the only 1980s British act to secure three No. 1 singles on both the UK and US charts.[2] Their career was marked by iconic moments, including their historic 1985 visit to China, where they became the first Western pop group to perform there, playing to 15,000 people at the Worker's Gymnasium in Beijing and gaining massive worldwide media attention.[2] The duo's final UK No. 1 single, "The Edge of Heaven," arrived in 1986, followed by their farewell concert "The Final" at Wembley Stadium on June 28, 1986, which drew 72,000 attendees.[2] With George Michael eager to pursue a more adult-oriented solo career, the partnership dissolved, though their friendship remained intact throughout their lives.

Wham!'s legacy endures as a defining force in 1980s pop culture, with their music continuing to resonate across generations. Andrew Ridgeley later documented their story in his 2019 memoir "Wham! George and Me," which provides an intimate account of their lifelong friendship and the band's formation and rise to stardom.[1][3] Following George Michael's death on December 25, 2016, Ridgeley paid tribute to his departed friend and later inducted him into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2023.[2]
