## Biography
Brokedown in Bakersfield is a short-lived but widely admired West Coast "supergroup" formed as a tribute to the classic Bakersfield sound of the 1950s–70s, the twangy, hard-edged California country associated with artists like Buck Owens and Merle Haggard.[1][2][5] The band brings together prominent musicians from the Northern California roots and jam scenes—most notably vocalists Nicki and Tim Bluhm—who set out to celebrate and reinterpret this era of country music with rich vocal harmonies, Telecaster-driven riffs, and a loose, live-in-the-room feel.[2][5] Emerging in the early 2010s, they first appeared at festivals and select club dates rather than as a full-time touring act, quickly earning a reputation for high-energy, deeply musical performances that honored the originals while adding jam-informed improvisation.[1][4]

Rather than focusing on original songs, Brokedown in Bakersfield built its identity around carefully chosen covers from Merle Haggard, George Jones, Gram Parsons, Wynn Stewart, and other architects of the Bakersfield and classic country sound, culminating in the live release "Brokedown in Bakersfield Live!" which documents their interpretations of this repertoire.[4][6] Their arrangements lean into pedal steel and electric guitar twang, shuffling rhythms, and call-and-response vocals, blending traditional country structures with the looser, exploratory sensibility of their members’ primary bands. Although the project has been intermittent—coming together for special shows and festival appearances rather than operating as a continuous touring band—it has left a distinct niche legacy as a modern roots collective that helped reintroduce Bakersfield country to jam-band and Americana audiences on the West Coast.[1][2][5]

The group’s core lineup is drawn from established Bay Area and West Coast acts: Nicki and Tim Bluhm (of Nicki Bluhm & The Gramblers and The Mother Hips), guitarist Scott Law, guitarist Dan “Lebo” Lebowitz (ALO), bassist Steve Adams (ALO), and drummer Dave Brogan (ALO).[2][5] Their credibility within the jam and Americana circuits helped the band secure high-profile festival spots, such as appearances at Hardly Strictly Bluegrass, where they were billed explicitly as a collective of acclaimed West Coast artists paying spirited homage to Bakersfield country.[5] While Brokedown in Bakersfield is not a full-time band with a long discography, its carefully curated shows and one prominent live release have made it a cult favorite among fans of alt-country, classic honky-tonk, and improvisational roots rock.[2][4][6]
