## Biography
Keith Jarrett, Gary Peacock, and Jack DeJohnette formed one of the most celebrated piano trios in jazz history, known as the 'Standards Trio.' Their collaboration began in earnest in 1983, though their musical paths had crossed earlier, notably on Peacock's 1977 album 'Tales of Another.' Jarrett, already renowned for his solo improvisational piano work, sought to revisit the Great American Songbook at a time when jazz was increasingly focused on original compositions and fusion. He chose Peacock and DeJohnette—both highly respected in their own right—for their depth, intuition, and shared musical language.

The trio's first recording session for ECM Records in New York City yielded enough material for three albums, including 'Standards, Vol. 1,' 'Standards, Vol. 2,' and 'Changes.' Uniquely, the group did not rehearse or pre-plan their playlist, relying instead on their collective improvisational prowess and deep understanding of the repertoire. Over the next three decades, the trio released more than a dozen albums, most recorded live, and became known for their telepathic interplay, lyrical interpretations, and ability to find new depths in familiar standards. Their legacy is one of redefining the jazz piano trio, demonstrating that profound artistry could be achieved through reinterpretation as much as innovation.
