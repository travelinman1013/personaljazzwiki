## Biography
Konyikeh is a British singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist born in London and raised in Essex, England. Of Cameroonian and Jamaican heritage, she was immersed in music from a young age, beginning piano lessons at seven and later studying classical singing, violin, and music theory at the prestigious Guildhall School of Music and Drama. Her upbringing in a black middle-class family and experiences navigating predominantly white classical spaces deeply inform her music, which is noted for its emotional vulnerability and themes of identity, isolation, and self-worth[1][2][3][4][7].

Konyikeh's career began with classical roots, performing in orchestras and chamber choirs, but her artistic vision naturally evolved to incorporate a wide range of influences, including jazz, Afrobeats, dancehall, and R&B. She first gained public attention in 2022, joining rapper Dave on stage at the Brit Awards for his performance of 'In The Fire,' which showcased her powerful, bluesy vocals[3][6][9]. In 2023, she released her debut singles 'Sorrow' and 'Teenage Dreams,' followed by her first EP, 'Litany.' The project, written largely during her teenage years, is a deeply personal exploration of vulnerability and empowerment, particularly for black girls, and has been praised for its expressive soundscapes and emotional maturity[2][4][5].

Konyikeh's musical style blends classical technique with contemporary genres, creating a distinctive sound characterized by raw lyricism and cinematic production. Her work often addresses systemic barriers in the music industry and aims to foster connection and comfort for listeners facing similar struggles. With her debut EP establishing her as a rising talent, Konyikeh continues to be recognized for her technical skill, emotional honesty, and commitment to authentic storytelling[1][2][3][4][5][7].
