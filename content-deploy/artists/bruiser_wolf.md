## Biography
Devaul Neal, professionally known as Bruiser Wolf and formerly as Big Wolf, is a Detroit-based rapper whose unconventional path to music reflects a lifetime of resilience and reinvention. Born in 1982, Neal experienced early hardship when his mother abandoned him, his two older brothers, and their father shortly after his birth. His father, working as a janitor, instilled in his sons a love of sports and soul music, frequently playing records by the Stylistics and Blue Magic while reciting Langston Hughes' poem 'Motto'—a piece Neal memorized and carried with him throughout his life. Neal's early musical influences came from watching his older cousin's group, Criminals of America, and later gravitating toward rap groups like Camp Lo and Nice & Smooth during his grade school years.[1]

Neal's early adulthood took a dramatic turn when he became a journeyman Arena Football player, but family responsibilities forced him to pivot. When he suddenly became the sole provider for his two infant daughters, two younger brothers, and ailing mother, he turned to hustling to survive. In his early 30s, while still partially involved in street life, Neal began rapping in earnest, isolating himself from doubters and recording at local Detroit studios and freestyling at showcases. He released a rough collection of songs in 2014 titled *D.O.P.E. (Do Our People Exist)*, which he doesn't consider his official debut but acknowledges showed promise.[1] The turning point came in 2019 when he performed 'Old Faithful' at Danny Brown's Bruiser Thanksgiving event, creating an immediate connection with the critically-lauded Detroit rapper and founder of Bruiser Brigade Records. This collaboration led to his official debut album *Dope Game Stupid*, released on March 29, 2021, which established him as a distinctive voice in contemporary hip-hop.[4]

Bruiser Wolf's artistic journey has been marked by profound personal loss and artistic evolution. During the recording of his debut album, his mother passed away; while recording his second album *My Story Got Stories* (released January 12, 2024), he lost his father—his 'right hand man' and steadfast supporter through both his struggles and his touring success with Bruiser Brigade.[3] Today, gladly retired from illicit activities, the now 42-year-old owns a landscaping company in Detroit, where he intermittently coaches youth and high school football while maintaining his music career. His musical style blends gritty, introspective lyricism with experimental production, drawing comparisons to E-40 and influenced by Iceberg Slim's narrative tradition. His third album, *Potluck*, was released in 2025, cementing his status as a rising talent in the hip-hop community.[4][5]

## Fun Facts
- Bruiser Wolf changed his stage name from 'Big Wolf' to 'Bruiser Wolf' as a badge of honor to express his loyalty and appreciation for his labelmates in Bruiser Brigade, literally putting 'Bruiser' in front of his name.[4]
- Before becoming a full-time rapper, Wolf was a journeyman Arena Football player and later owned a landscaping company in Detroit while simultaneously pursuing music—he recorded his debut album during the slow winter season of 2020 when landscaping work was minimal.[1]
- During the recording of his debut album, Wolf lost his voice completely after intensive studio sessions, arguing, and getting sick. When he recorded 'God Bless How I Chew This' with a damaged voice, he realized he had discovered a new artistic direction and knew he could never go back to his previous approach.[3]
- Wolf's father memorized and frequently recited Langston Hughes' poem 'Motto' so often that young Devaul Neal memorized it as well, carrying this literary influence throughout his life and artistic career.[1]
