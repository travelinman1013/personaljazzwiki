## Biography
Sassy 009 is the artistic moniker of Sunniva Lindgård, a Scandinavian musician born in Sweden and raised in Oslo, Norway. Originally conceived as a trio with Teodora Georgijević and Johanna Scheie Orellana, Sassy 009 emerged from the Oslo music scene, debuting with the EP 'Do You Mind' in 2017. After early acclaim—including a feature as one of The Guardian's 'Ones to Watch'—Lindgård continued the project solo, releasing the album 'Kill Sassy 009' in 2019 and 'Heart Ego' in 2021. Her music blends art pop, electronica, and techno influences, characterized by cinematic soundscapes and introspective lyricism, drawing from her upbringing in a musically rich household where both parents were classical musicians.[1][2]

Blood Orange is the stage name of Devonté (Dev) Hynes, an English musician and producer of Guyanese and Sierra Leonean descent. Hynes began his career in the UK punk band Test Icicles before adopting the moniker Lightspeed Champion for two orchestral pop albums. As Blood Orange, he has become a leading figure in contemporary art pop and R&B, acclaimed for albums like 'Freetown Sound' (2016) and 'Negro Swan' (2018), which explore themes of identity, race, and personal experience. Hynes is also a prolific collaborator and producer, working with artists such as Solange, FKA twigs, and Mariah Carey, and composing film scores.[3][7]

In 2021, Sassy 009 and Blood Orange joined forces on the single 'Tell Me,' blending Lindgård's hypnotic, minimalist production with Hynes' signature hushed vocals. This collaboration highlights the intersection of Scandinavian art pop and the emotive, genre-blurring style that has defined Blood Orange's legacy, further cementing both artists' reputations as innovative voices in modern pop and electronic music.[4][5]
