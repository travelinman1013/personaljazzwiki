## Biography
Slim Gaillard, born Bulee Gaillard (birth date variously cited as January 4, 1916 or January 9, 1911) in Detroit, Michigan or possibly Santa Clara, Cuba, was a singular figure in American jazz, celebrated for his inventive humor, linguistic playfulness, and musical versatility[1][2][3][5]. Gaillard mastered a wide range of instruments, including piano, guitar, vibraphone, drums, and saxophone, and was equally adept as a composer, singer, and even tap-dancer[1][3]. His early life was marked by a period as a merchant seaman and professional cook before he found his calling in music[1].

Gaillard rose to fame in the late 1930s as one half of the duo Slim & Slam, alongside bassist Slam Stewart. Their 1938 hit "Flat Foot Floogie (with a Floy Floy)" topped charts and established Gaillard's reputation for blending swing, jive, and comedic novelty with a surrealist edge[1][2][3]. He was renowned for his use of 'Vout', a private, jive-inspired language that infused his performances with a dadaist sense of absurdity and improvisational flair[1][2]. After serving in the U.S. Army during World War II, Gaillard returned to the jazz scene, collaborating with bebop luminaries such as Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie, notably on the 1945 recording "Slim's Jam"[1][2][3].

Though his popularity waned in the U.S. during the 1950s, Gaillard's career endured through radio, film, and later a resurgence in Europe, where he performed at jazz festivals and recorded with new generations of musicians[2][4]. He spent his final years in London, where he continued to perform and appeared in television and film until his death in 1991. Gaillard's legacy endures as a jazz innovator whose boundary-pushing humor, linguistic creativity, and improvisational genius influenced both his contemporaries and later artists, including those in rap and hip-hop[2][3][4].
