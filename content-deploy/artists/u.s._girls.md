## Biography
U.S. Girls is the acclaimed art pop project of American-Canadian musician Meg Remy, who was born in Illinois and later relocated to Toronto, Canada. Remy began her musical journey in the mid-2000s, initially recording lo-fi experimental pop using a four-track tape recorder after moving to Portland, Oregon. Her debut album, 'Introducing,' arrived in 2007 as a limited CD-R release, marking the start of a prolific and ever-evolving career characterized by restless creativity and genre-blurring experimentation.[2]

Over the years, Remy has transformed U.S. Girls from a solo bedroom project into a collaborative endeavor, enlisting a wide array of musicians for both studio recordings and live performances. Her music draws from a diverse palette, blending elements of 1960s girl group pop, avant-garde, soul, and dance music, often underpinned by incisive social commentary and narrative storytelling. Albums like 'Half Free,' 'Heavy Light,' and 'Bless This Mess' showcase her ability to merge retro influences with modern production, resulting in a sound described as 'diamond-cut melodies and avant-garde urges.'[2] Her 2024 album 'Scratch It' was recorded live in Nashville with a band of seasoned musicians, further highlighting her commitment to collaboration and sonic exploration.[1]

Remy's work has been widely praised for its innovation and emotional depth, establishing her as a leading figure in contemporary art pop. Her legacy is defined by her fearless approach to reinvention, her embrace of collaboration, and her influence on a new generation of genre-defying musicians.
