## Biography
Will Hoge was born on November 14, 1972, in Nashville, Tennessee, where he grew up in a musical family influenced by his musician father and uncles, along with his father's extensive record collection. After attending Western Kentucky University to study history with aspirations of becoming a high school teacher and basketball coach, Hoge shifted focus to music, dropping out to pursue rock and roll. He began his career touring the American South with former Georgia Satellites guitarist Dan Baird, self-releasing his debut live album *Live At The Exit/In* and studio album *Carousel* in 2001.[1][5][6]

Signed to Atlantic Records in 2002, Hoge re-released *Carousel* and debuted *Blackbird On A Lonely Wire* in 2003, though poor promotion led him to request a release from the label. Embracing independence, he self-released live albums, politically charged works like *The America EP*, and bluesy rock efforts such as *The Man Who Killed Love* (2006), sustained by relentless touring. A severe scooter accident in 2008 forced a seven-month hiatus, but he resumed with albums like *The Wreckage* (2009), *Number Seven* (2011, self-produced), *Never Give In* (2013), *Small Town Dream* (2015), *Anchors* (2017), *My American Dream* (2018), *Tiny Little Movies* (2020), and *Wings On My Shoes* (2022). His style blends **Americana**, **heartland rock**, soulful storytelling, Telecaster-driven riffs, and anthemic blue-collar themes, earning Grammy, CMA, and ACM nominations for 'Even If It Breaks Your Heart,' a #1 country hit for Eli Young Band.[1][2][3]

Hoge's legacy lies in his DIY ethos, pioneering Americana's roots-rock fusion before its Grammy recognition, and maintaining a global fanbase through high-energy live shows and independent releases. He has toured with acts like Needtobreathe, Sugarland, Michelle Branch, and Social Distortion, while songs like 'Strong' featured in Chevy ads and covers by Lady Antebellum highlight his songwriting impact.[1][2]
