## Biography
Wilbert Thirkield "Big Chief" Ellis (November 10, 1914 – December 20, 1977) was an influential American blues pianist and vocalist, born in Birmingham, Alabama. Largely self-taught, Ellis began playing piano at local parties and dances in Birmingham during the late 1920s, developing a distinctive style rooted in classic and country blues traditions. His early years were marked by a deep immersion in the local music scene, despite coming from a religious family.

After serving in the Army from 1939 to 1942, Ellis relocated to New York City, where he became a sought-after accompanist for touring blues musicians. Throughout the 1940s and 1950s, he recorded with Lenox Records and worked with notable artists such as Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee for Capitol Records. In the 1970s, Ellis moved to Washington, D.C., where he operated a liquor store but continued to record, notably for Trix Records, collaborating with musicians like Tarheel Slim and John Cephas. He passed away in his hometown of Birmingham at the age of 63, leaving behind a legacy as a respected figure in the blues piano tradition.
