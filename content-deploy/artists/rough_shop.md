## Biography
Rough Shop is a **St. Louis, Missouri–based rock and roots band** that has been recording and performing since the mid-2000s.[3][4] Emerging from the city’s tight-knit Americana and indie scene, the group coalesced around a shared love of songcraft, vintage rock & roll, country, and soul, channeling those influences into a distinctly Midwestern sound. From their earliest releases onward, Rough Shop cultivated a reputation as a songwriter-driven band, balancing tuneful hooks with literate, often wryly observed lyrics about everyday life, relationships, and the passage of time.[3]

The band’s core has long centered on principal songwriters **Andy Ploof** and **John Wendland**, supported by a rotating but stable circle of St. Louis musicians who help shape the group’s arrangements and live sound.[3] Since 2006, Rough Shop has released multiple albums and EPs, including the holiday-themed "Lit Up Like a Christmas Tree," and has become locally known for its annual holiday concerts, where the band mixes original seasonal songs with reimagined classics.[3][5][6] Musically, Rough Shop’s work ranges from rock and power-pop to folk and country-tinged material, often featuring acoustic and electric guitars, vocal harmonies, and an emphasis on narrative songwriting. Over time, the group has solidified a legacy as a dependable, enduring presence in the St. Louis music community, particularly associated with its long-running holiday shows and its commitment to original material.[3][4][5][6]
