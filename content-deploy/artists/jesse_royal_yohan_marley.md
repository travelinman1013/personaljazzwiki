## Biography
Jesse David Leroi Grey, professionally known as Jesse Royal, was born on April 29, 1989, in Kingston, Jamaica. He spent his formative years in the hills of Maroon Town and the Orange District of St. James before relocating to Kingston in the late 1990s with his mother and brother to join his father. During his school years, Royal developed a transformative friendship with Daniel 'Bambaata' Marley, son of reggae legend Ziggy Marley, with whom he shared an intense passion for music and football. This pivotal connection catalyzed his musical journey, as the two friends began composing and creating original music with the assistance of longtime collaborator Curt 'Qban' White.

Royal's professional career gained significant momentum following his collaboration with renowned reggae producer Philip 'Fatis' Burrell, who was captivated by his distinctive voice and militant character combined with profound lyricism. In 2017, he released his debut album 'Lily of da Valley' through Easy Star Records, which he co-executive produced with Lamar 'Riff Raff' Brown. The album achieved critical acclaim and topped the Billboard Reggae Album charts, featuring legendary session musicians including Sly Dunbar, Robbie Shakespeare, and Earl 'Chinna' Smith. His second album 'Royal,' released in 2021, earned him a Grammy Award nomination and established him as a leading contemporary voice in reggae music.

Yohan Marley, son of Stephen 'Ragga' Marley, represents the next generation of the Marley musical legacy. He has emerged as a significant collaborator in the reggae scene, most notably working with Jesse Royal on the poignant single 'Blessing,' a tribute to Jo Mersa Marley (his brother). Through his reggae-inspired music, Yohan continues to write another chapter in Jamaican musical history, contributing to the genre's evolution while honoring its roots.
