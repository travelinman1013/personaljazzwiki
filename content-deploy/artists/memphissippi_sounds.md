## Biography
Memphissippi Sounds is a dynamic blues duo formed by Cameron Kimbrough and Damion “Yella P” Pearson, whose collaboration bridges the musical traditions of North Mississippi hill country and Memphis blues. Cameron Kimbrough, grandson of the legendary bluesman Junior Kimbrough, grew up immersed in the sounds of his family's juke joint in Potts Camp, Mississippi, where he developed his rhythmic, stripped-down approach to the blues. Damion Pearson, a Memphis native, taught himself harmonica from the age of 13, honing his skills on Beale Street and absorbing the city’s rich musical heritage.

The two musicians met by chance on Beale Street, instantly connecting over their shared passion for the blues. Their partnership led to the formation of Memphissippi Sounds, a project that fuses Kimbrough’s hill country blues with Pearson’s Beale Street harmonica, further enriched by elements of Memphis soul and hip-hop. Their debut album, 'Welcome to the Land' (2021), produced by Aki Kumar, received critical acclaim and earned them a Blues Music Award nomination for Best Emerging Artist Album. Since their formation, Memphissippi Sounds has performed at venues ranging from juke joints to major festivals across the United States and internationally, carrying forward and innovating within the blues tradition.
