## Biography
Williamson Branch is a Nashville-based family bluegrass and gospel group formed in 2014 by guitarist and songwriter Kevin Williamson, his mandolin‑playing wife Debbie, and their three daughters, Melody, Kadence, and Caroline.[2][3][4][6] Kevin and Debbie were already veterans of the bluegrass circuit and Pinecastle Records alumni when they decided to build a band around their growing family, extending a musical lineage that spans three generations.[2][6][9] Drawing on backgrounds in bluegrass, classic country, southern gospel, Christian country, and even dance, they crafted a sound rooted in traditional bluegrass while embracing contemporary songwriting and showmanship, quickly becoming a touring act on major festival and concert stages across the U.S. and Canada, including the Ryman Auditorium and Bill Gaither’s Fall Homecoming.[1][2]

From their debut projects on their own Enrichertainment imprint to a run of acclaimed albums on Pinecastle Records—such as *Free* (2018), *Classy. Sassy. Bluegrass.* (2019), *Heritage & Hope* (2021), and *Southern Sunshine* (2025)—Williamson Branch has built a catalog that blends original material with classics of bluegrass, country, and gospel.[2][5][6] Their polished, family‑harmony‑driven approach helped singles like “Blue Moon Over Texas” spend seven weeks at No. 1 on the RMR Bluegrass Chart, while gospel and inspirational songs such as “Get on Board,” “Walking in the Spirit,” “Thank You Lord For Your Blessings on Me,” and “I’ll Fly Away” each topped key bluegrass and southern gospel airplay charts.[1][2] Melody Williamson Keyes emerged as a standout vocalist and multi‑instrumentalist—recognized as the International Bluegrass Music Association’s Momentum Vocalist of the Year in 2020—while Kadence and Caroline developed into featured singers and instrumentalists, giving the band a multi‑generational appeal that resonates in both live shows and viral social media performances.[1][2][5][7]

Musically, Williamson Branch is distinguished by tight, “organic” family harmonies, energetic stagecraft, and a repertoire that moves fluidly between hard‑driving bluegrass, “soulgrass” vocals, patriotic originals, and traditional and contemporary gospel.[2][5][6] Critics have highlighted their balance of tradition and freshness: reviews of albums like *Free* and *Classy. Sassy. Bluegrass.* praise their original songwriting—often contributed by all five family members—alongside inventive covers of songs by Bill Monroe, Hank Williams, Loretta Lynn, and The Isaacs.[5][6] Their extensive touring and online presence, with several videos earning tens of millions of views and a social following in the hundreds of thousands, have made them one of the more visible modern family bands in bluegrass and Christian roots music, earning honors such as Valley Star Family Vocal Group of the Year and individual distinctions including membership in organizations like Daughters of Bluegrass and Kids on Bluegrass.[1][2]
