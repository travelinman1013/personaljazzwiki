## Biography
Bamboula 2000 is a New Orleans-based musical group founded in 1994 by percussionist Luther Gray, whose vision was to honor and extend the cultural legacy of Congo Square—a historic site where enslaved Africans and free people of color gathered to drum, dance, and preserve African traditions. The ensemble's name reflects both a nod to the traditional bamboula drum and dance, as well as a commitment to carrying this heritage into the new millennium. Gray, who previously played with Percussion Inc., formed Bamboula 2000 to blend traditional African percussion with melodic instruments and dance, creating a participatory and inclusive musical experience.

Musically, Bamboula 2000 fuses African drumming with contemporary genres such as rhythm and blues, reggae, funk, jazz, and even pop, reflecting the diverse musical landscape of New Orleans. Their albums, including 'Up from Congo Square' and 'Cuba to Congo Square,' showcase this eclecticism, featuring original compositions and collaborations with musicians from Africa and the African diaspora. The group is known for its vibrant live performances, particularly its weekly drum circles at Congo Square, where community members and visitors are invited to join in the music-making, embodying the spirit of communal celebration and cultural continuity.

Bamboula 2000's legacy lies in its dedication to cultural preservation, education, and innovation. The group has played a pivotal role in raising awareness about the historical significance of Congo Square and has inspired a new generation of musicians and dancers to explore their African roots. Through performances at major venues and festivals, as well as community outreach, Bamboula 2000 continues to be a vital force in the musical and cultural life of New Orleans.
