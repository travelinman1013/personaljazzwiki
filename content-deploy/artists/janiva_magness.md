## Biography
Janiva Magness (born January 30, 1957) is an American blues, soul, and Americana singer, songwriter, and author, widely regarded as one of the leading contemporary blues vocalists of her generation.[1][4] Born in Detroit, Michigan, she grew up immersed in her father’s blues and country records alongside the city’s rich Motown soul sound, influences that would later ground her emotionally direct, groove‑driven style.[1][6] Her early life was marked by severe hardship, including physical and sexual abuse, the suicides of both parents, years spent in foster care, struggles with addiction, and becoming a teenage mother—experiences she later chronicled in her 2019 memoir *Weeds Like Us*.[4] As a young woman she relocated to Minnesota, studied engineering, and worked in a Saint Paul recording studio, where she was first persuaded to sing backing vocals, leading to early work supporting artists like Kid Ramos and R.L. Burnside and eventually to forming her own band, the Mojomatics, in Phoenix.[1]

Magness moved to Los Angeles in 1986 and began building a reputation on the West Coast blues scene, releasing her debut album *More Than Live* in 1991 and following it with a string of independent records across the 1990s.[1] A key turn came with her NorthernBlues Music releases *Bury Him at the Crossroads* (2004) and *Do I Move You?* (2006), both co‑produced with Colin Linden; the latter reached the *Billboard* Blues Albums Top 10 and helped establish her internationally.[1] After signing to Alligator Records, she expanded her touring across the U.S., Canada, and Europe and began to incorporate more soul and Americana elements, later crystallized on albums like *What Love Will Do* (2008), *Love Wins Again* (2016)—which earned her a Grammy nomination—and *Love Is an Army* (2018).[1][2][4] Known for an earthy, raw vocal delivery rooted in classic blues, she has increasingly focused on original songwriting, especially on her 2014 album *Original* and later releases like *Hard to Kill* (2022), aligning her personal history with songs that blend blues, soul, funk, and Americana.[1][4]

Over the course of her career, Magness has released more than a dozen albums and become one of the most decorated contemporary blues artists, earning seven Blues Music Awards and 29 nominations, including the B.B. King Entertainer of the Year award in 2009—making her only the second woman after Koko Taylor to receive that honor.[1][4] *USA Today* has described her as a “blues star,” and she is frequently cited as a major modern voice in blues and R&B for her capacity to convey vulnerability, resilience, and hard‑won hope.[1][5] Her crossover into Americana, highlighted by repeated appearances at the Americana Music Conference and Festival in Nashville, reflects both her stylistic versatility and her commitment to storytelling rooted in real‑life struggle and survival.[1][2][4] Alongside her recordings and touring, her memoir and public discussions of trauma, recovery, and foster care have contributed to her broader legacy as an artist who uses blues tradition not only for musical expression but also as a vehicle for personal and social healing.[3][4]

## Fun Facts
- Before becoming a professional singer, Janiva Magness studied to be an engineer and worked in a Saint Paul recording studio, where she was first pushed into doing backing vocals—a detour that sparked her full‑time music career.[1]
- She once rode the same city bus in Minneapolis as Prince and remembers seeing him regularly on Hennepin Avenue before he became a major star, during the period when both were circulating in the local club scene.[4]
- Magness is only the second woman ever to receive the Blues Foundation’s prestigious B.B. King Entertainer of the Year award, following legendary blues singer Koko Taylor.[1]
- Her 2019 memoir *Weeds Like Us* and her album *Hard to Kill* are intentionally linked projects: the album’s opening track “Strong As Steel” and other songs were written to mirror and expand on the personal stories revealed in the book.[4]
