## Biography
June Freedom is a genre-bending singer-songwriter and producer born on June 24, 1988, in Boston, Massachusetts, and raised in Cape Verde. His early years on the volcanic island of Fogo immersed him in the rich musical traditions of Cape Verde, particularly Morna—a style blending Portuguese, African, Brazilian, and Cuban influences. At age 12, he represented Cape Verde in a singing competition in Portugal, an experience that solidified his ambition to pursue music on a global stage.

After moving to the United States at 14, June lived in Boston, New York City, and later Los Angeles, each city shaping his evolving artistry. He is known for his multilingual approach, singing in English, Portuguese, Spanish, and Kriolu, and for blending Afro-Latin rhythms, alt-pop, R&B, and worldbeat. His debut album, 'Anchor Baby,' became a Cape Verdean classic, while '7 SEAS' and the 2025 release 'Casa Mira Mar' have further established him as a leading voice in the global Afro-diasporic music scene. June Freedom has garnered over 300 million streams, sold out shows across Europe and the US, and is recognized as the most listened-to Cape Verdean artist worldwide, surpassing legends like Cesária Évora and Nelson Freitas. His work is celebrated for expanding the reach of Afro sounds and for its deeply personal, borderless character.
