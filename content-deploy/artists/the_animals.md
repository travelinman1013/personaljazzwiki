## Biography
The Animals were an English rock band formed in Newcastle upon Tyne in 1962, initially as the Alan Price Rhythm and Blues Combo, with Eric Burdon joining as frontman alongside keyboardist Alan Price, guitarist Hilton Valentine, bassist Chas Chandler, and drummer John Steel. Known for their gritty, bluesy sound blending British pop and American blues influences, they rose to fame during the British Invasion with raw, powerful hits like 'House of the Rising Sun,' which topped charts worldwide in 1964, followed by 'We Gotta Get Out of This Place,' 'It's My Life,' and 'Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood.' Their music featured tough, rock-edged pop singles contrasted with rhythm-and-blues album tracks, propelled by Burdon's distinctive, raspy vocals.[1][3][5]

Personnel changes began in 1965 when Alan Price departed for a solo career, replaced by Dave Rowberry, and John Steel left in 1966, with Barry Jenkins taking over; poor management contributed to the original lineup's split later that year. Eric Burdon reformed the group as Eric Burdon & the Animals in 1966, moving to California and shifting to psychedelic and progressive rock with hits like 'San Franciscan Nights,' 'When I Was Young,' and 'Sky Pilot,' incorporating soul, folk, and experimental elements before disbanding in 1968. The original members briefly reunited in 1975-1976 for the album *Before We Were So Rudely Interrupted*, in 1983 for *Ark* and a tour, and have seen various partial regroupings since, with inductions into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994 recognizing their 10 top-20 hits in the UK and US.[1][2][4]

The band's legacy endures through ongoing touring iterations like Animals & Friends (featuring John Steel) and Eric Burdon & the Animals, maintaining their classic rock status with a Spotify popularity of 68 in the genre. Their raw energy and blues roots influenced the rock landscape, bridging R&B with the Invasion sound.[1][3][5]
