## Biography
Talking Heads were an American rock band formed in New York City in 1975 by three Rhode Island School of Design classmates: David Byrne (vocals, guitar), Chris Frantz (drums), and Tina Weymouth (bass). The trio moved to New York in 1975 and quickly became part of the emerging punk scene at CBGB, where they performed their first show opening for the Ramones. In March 1977, keyboardist and guitarist Jerry Harrison, formerly of the Modern Lovers, joined the group to complete the classic lineup. Signed to Sire Records in late 1976, Talking Heads released their debut single "Love → Building on Fire" in February 1977 and went on to release eight studio albums before disbanding in 1991.

Talking Heads pioneered new wave music by synthesizing punk, art rock, funk, and world music into a distinctive sound characterized by anxious yet clean-cut aesthetics and innovative production techniques. Their collaboration with producer Brian Eno on early albums established their experimental direction, while later releases like 1983's "Speaking in Tongues" achieved greater commercial success with hits such as "Burning Down the House" and "This Must Be the Place." The 1984 concert film "Stop Making Sense," directed by Jonathan Demme, became a landmark documentary that brought their inimitable style to a wider audience and showcased their evolution into confident interpreters of funk, disco, and polyrhythmic Afrobeat.

Despite internal tensions regarding David Byrne's creative control and the band's direction, Talking Heads remained influential throughout the 1980s and early 1990s. Following their 1991 breakup, all members pursued successful solo careers: Byrne became a prolific multimedia experimentalist and founded the Luaka Bop label; Frantz and Weymouth continued recording and touring with Tom Tom Club; and Harrison established himself as a respected producer. The band briefly reunited as the Heads in 1996 and all four members performed together at their 2002 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction.

## Fun Facts
- Tina Weymouth was recruited as bassist despite having no prior bass-playing experience—she was asked to join because the band couldn't recruit new members in New York City and she was available as Frantz's girlfriend and fellow art student.
- The band's name 'Talking Heads' came from a term used in television production, reflecting their art school sensibility and conceptual approach to rock music.
- The documentary film 'Stop Making Sense' took its title from a line in the song 'Girlfriend Is Better' and became a landmark concert film that significantly expanded the band's audience beyond their existing fanbase.
- Chris Frantz and Tina Weymouth became so dissatisfied with David Byrne's role as frontman and his creative control that they purchased a home in the Bahamas in 1980 and formed a new perspective on the band's direction during their recording hiatus.
