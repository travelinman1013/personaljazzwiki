## Biography
Bernard Lee Purdie, born June 11, 1939, in Elkton, Maryland, is widely recognized as one of the most influential and prolific drummers in modern music. Growing up as the eleventh of fifteen children, Purdie was drawn to rhythm from a young age, inspired by the sounds of trains and early exposure to drumming through local musicians. He formally learned drumming techniques from Leonard Heywood and was influenced by jazz greats like Papa Jo Jones, Buddy Rich, and Art Blakey[1].

Purdie moved to New York City in the early 1960s, quickly establishing himself as a first-call session drummer. He began working with King Curtis and soon became a fixture in the studios, playing on thousands of recordings across genres including R&B, soul, funk, jazz, and rock. His precise timekeeping, groove, and the creation of the signature 'Purdie Shuffle' made him a sought-after collaborator for artists such as Aretha Franklin, Steely Dan, James Brown, Miles Davis, Hall & Oates, and many more[3][4][5]. Purdie served as Aretha Franklin's musical director from 1970 to 1975, contributing to some of her most celebrated live and studio recordings[1].

Purdie's legacy is defined by his technical mastery, rhythmic innovation, and versatility. He is often called 'the world's most recorded drummer,' having played on over 3,000 albums[3][5][9]. His influence extends far beyond his own performances, shaping the sound of popular music for over six decades and inspiring generations of drummers with his distinctive style and enduring contributions.
