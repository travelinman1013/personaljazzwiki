## Biography
Misty Blues is a modern blues band founded and fronted by vocalist, songwriter, and multi‑instrumentalist Gina Coleman, and based in Berkshire County, Massachusetts.[1][2][7] Coleman, a Williams College graduate, began singing in 1990 after a dare from co‑workers and first worked in folk‑rock settings with duos The Siblings and Cole‑Connection, which later expanded into a full band for her early original material.[3][2][5] The decisive turn toward the blues came in 1999, when she was cast as a gospel singer in the Williamstown Theatre Festival production of *A Raisin in the Sun*; lead actor Ruben Santiago‑Hudson, along with Mandy Patinkin and Gwyneth Paltrow, encouraged her to pursue classic blues, prompting her to form Misty Blues with former Cole‑Connection bandmates.[1][2][3] 

Since 1999, Misty Blues has specialized in original and traditional blues infused with jazz, soul, funk, and tent‑revival gospel, paying particular homage to the bold female blues voices of the early 20th century while also honoring classic male artists from the 1920s–40s.[1][2] The band has built a strong New England presence and toured across the continental U.S., Canada, Ireland, and the UK, with airplay on outlets such as SiriusXM’s B.B. King’s Bluesville and other specialty blues programs in the U.S. and UK.[1][2] Their discography includes projects ranging from classic blues interpretations (*Electric Juke Joint*) and gospel‑tinged dance material (*Roadhouse Revival*) to fully original albums such as *Between The Stacks* (featuring Charles Neville), *Dark & Saucy*, and *Call & Response*, as well as later releases like *Pickled & Aged* and *Silver Lining* that showcase a seasoned, contemporary blues sound.[2][5][6] 

Artistically, Misty Blues draws on the vocal and stylistic legacy of Koko Taylor, Bessie Smith, Billie Holiday, and jazz duo Tuck & Patti, channeling brassy, emotionally direct singing, story‑driven lyrics, and groove‑oriented arrangements into a modern blues‑rock and boogie‑woogie context.[3] The group has collaborated in the studio with Charles Neville and Joe Louis Walker, shared stages with Eric Gales and Kat Riggins, and opened for leading contemporary blues acts including Shemekia Copeland, Tab Benoit, Roomful Of Blues, John Primer, Albert Cummings, Mike Zito, Albert Castiglia, James Montgomery, and Michael Powers.[1][2][3] Recognized as a 2019 International Blues Challenge finalist and multiple Independent Blues Music Awards nominee, the band has earned sustained radio play and, notably, saw one of its songs selected for use in a U.S. presidential campaign advertisement in 2024, underscoring Misty Blues’ blend of traditional roots and current social resonance.[1][3][7]

## Fun Facts
- Gina Coleman began her singing career in 1990 on a dare from her co‑workers, performing first in a duet called The Siblings before ever leading a blues band.
- The idea for Misty Blues came directly from a theater role: after Coleman played a gospel singer in a Williamstown Theatre Festival production of *A Raisin in the Sun*, cast members including Ruben Santiago-Hudson and Mandy Patinkin urged her to sing blues professionally.
- Coleman initially hesitated to play guitar on stage because she felt her skills did not match her bandmates, but she later fell in love with the cigar box guitar, now a distinctive feature of Misty Blues’ live shows and the album *Call & Response*.
- In 2019 Misty Blues reached the finals of the International Blues Challenge, and by 2024 one of their songs was prominent enough to be chosen for use in a U.S. presidential campaign advertisement.
