## Biography
Amanda Anne Platt & The Honeycutters is an Americana band based in Asheville, North Carolina, formed in 2007. Amanda Anne Platt, originally from upstate New York near New York City, moved to Asheville in the mid-2000s initially to pursue a career as a luthier, apprenticing under Brad Nickerson. However, she found herself increasingly drawn to performing music rather than building guitars, and began playing with what would become The Honeycutters alongside then-musical and life partner Peter James. The band quickly gained traction in the Asheville music scene and regional radio, eventually signing with Organic Records, a prominent Americana label in the region. By their third album, Me Oh My (2015), they were receiving national acclaim in the music press.

Following the end of her personal and musical partnership with Peter James, Platt regrouped and rebranded the project as Amanda Anne Platt & The Honeycutters in 2017, reflecting that she was the only original member and the consistent creative force as singer and songwriter. The band's sound has evolved significantly over their seven full-length albums, moving away from the traditional country classification that initially defined them. Platt has deliberately expanded beyond pedal steel and fiddle-driven arrangements, incorporating influences from indie and garage rock while maintaining roots in Americana. Her songwriting has matured from early romantic themes to more complex explorations of loneliness and interpersonal relationships on a broader scale. The pandemic accelerated their creative process, leading to the monthly single release format that culminated in the album The Devil and the Deep Blue Sea.

Platt's artistic journey reflects a conscious effort to authentically represent her musical identity rather than conform to regional expectations. Initially self-conscious about her New York origins in the Southern music scene, she has since embraced her diverse influences—from her parents' love of country, blues, 1960s rock, and Texas singer-songwriters to theatrical show tunes. Her voice has become increasingly assured and authoritative over the years, supported by a band that includes keyboardist Kevin Williams, guitarist Matt Smith, bassist Rick Cooper, and drummer Evan Martin (her current husband). The Honeycutters' music is characterized by clean, relaxed vocals, sophisticated storytelling, and melodies that transcend traditional country boundaries.

## Fun Facts
- Amanda Anne Platt initially moved to Asheville in January or February 2007 to become a luthier, living at Bon Paul & Sharky's on Haywood Road (before it became a hostel) and building a guitar with a rosewood back and sides using a heated iron to shape the sides while staying warm with a space heater in a warehouse studio behind The Orange Peel.
- When first starting her music career, Platt was so self-conscious about being from New York that she adopted a fake Southern accent on the band's 2009 debut album Irene, a choice she now reflects on with some embarrassment.
- During the COVID-19 pandemic, the band's creative process accelerated dramatically—home recordings morphed into studio demos, then remote band recordings, and ultimately a disciplined monthly single release schedule that Platt credits to her need for external deadlines to maintain productivity.
- Platt's early musical influences were eclectic, ranging from her parents' country and blues records to 1960s rock, Texas singer-songwriters like Lucinda Williams and Jimmie Dale Gilmore, and theatrical show tunes including the Cats Soundtrack, Oliver, and West Side Story.
