## Biography
Memphis Minnie, born Lizzie Douglas on June 3, 1897, in either Tunica County, Mississippi or Algiers, Louisiana, was one of the most influential blues guitarists, vocalists, and songwriters of the 20th century. The eldest of 13 children, she received her first guitar at age seven and was performing at parties by age eleven. At thirteen, she ran away to Memphis, Tennessee, where she busked on Beale Street and soon joined the Ringling Brothers Circus as a touring musician, gaining valuable experience and exposure.

Returning to Memphis, Minnie partnered with guitarist Joe McCoy, performing as a duo that caught the attention of Columbia Records. Renamed Kansas Joe and Memphis Minnie, they recorded several successful tracks, including the classic "Bumble Bee." After their separation in the mid-1930s, Minnie moved to Chicago, where she established herself as a solo artist and embraced the electric guitar, a pioneering move for blues musicians of her era. Over a career spanning more than three decades, she recorded nearly 200 songs, such as "When the Levee Breaks" and "Me and My Chauffeur Blues," and became known for her assertive guitar playing, expressive vocals, and songwriting prowess.

Memphis Minnie's legacy is profound: she broke gender barriers in the male-dominated blues scene and influenced generations of musicians. Her music bridged rural and urban blues styles, and she remained active until health issues slowed her in the late 1950s. She died in 1973, and her contributions have since been recognized by artists and historians as foundational to the development of blues and American popular music.
