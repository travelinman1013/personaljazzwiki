## Biography
James Andrews, a renowned trumpeter, vocalist, and bandleader from New Orleans, was born into a musical family as the grandson of Jesse 'Ooh-Poo-Pah-Doo' Hill, a key figure in early New Orleans R&B. Known as 'Satchmo of the Ghetto' or '12' in his Treme neighborhood, Andrews emerged from the local brass band scene, playing with groups like the Treme Brass Band and New Birth Brass Band before forming his own ensemble, James Andrews and the Crescent City All-Stars. His early career included performances alongside jazz legends such as Danny Barker, Dizzy Gillespie, Dr. John, and Quincy Jones, blending traditional New Orleans brass band traditions with contemporary R&B, soul, zydeco, and Cajun influences.[1][2][3][6]

## Fun Facts

- One of the first musicians to return to New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, performing with Trombone Shorty at Jackson Square just 17 days later, declaring 'We’re gonna rebuild this city, note by note.'[1]
- Contributed to the 2011 Grammy-nominated soundtrack for HBO’s 'Treme' and performed at high-profile events like Jazz at Lincoln Center's Louis Armstrong tribute and Sundance Film Festival.[2]
