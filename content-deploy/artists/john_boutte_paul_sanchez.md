## Biography
John Boutté and Paul Sanchez are two celebrated musicians from New Orleans whose collaboration embodies the city’s rich musical tapestry. John Boutté, born in 1958 to a Creole family in New Orleans’ 7th Ward, grew up immersed in music and church traditions. Influenced by jazz, R&B, and gospel, he developed a distinctive vocal style, often described as reedy and soulful, reminiscent of Sam Cooke. Boutté’s performances at local venues like d.b.a. on Frenchmen Street and his stirring post-Katrina renditions, such as Randy Newman’s “Louisiana,” have made him a beloved figure in the city’s music scene[4][6][7][8].

Paul Sanchez, born November 6, 1959, also hails from New Orleans and was raised in the Irish Channel neighborhood. He began performing at age fifteen and became a founding member of the rock band Cowboy Mouth, contributing as a guitarist, singer, and songwriter from 1990 to 2006. After Hurricane Katrina, Sanchez left Cowboy Mouth and returned to New Orleans, focusing on solo work and songwriting. He is known for blending New Orleans street music, introspective singer-songwriter traditions, and rock, and has released over 20 solo albums[1][2][5].

The partnership between Boutté and Sanchez is best exemplified by their 2009 album "Stew Called New Orleans," a project that fuses Sanchez’s songwriting with Boutté’s expressive vocals. Their collaboration, marked by mutual respect and deep roots in New Orleans’ musical heritage, extends to the theatrical production “Nine Lives,” a song cycle chronicling the stories of New Orleanians who survived hurricanes Betsy and Katrina. Together, they have contributed significantly to the preservation and evolution of New Orleans’ musical legacy[3][4].
