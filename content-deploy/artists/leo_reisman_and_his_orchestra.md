## Biography
Leo F. Reisman (October 11, 1897 – December 18, 1961) was born and raised in Boston, Massachusetts, where he received a violin for his tenth birthday and began studying the instrument, inspired by violinist Jascha Heifetz. By age 12, he was plugging songs in a music store, attended the New England Conservatory, and at 17 played in the Baltimore Symphony and led the orchestra at the Hotel Belvedere in Baltimore. Rejected by the Boston Symphony Orchestra, he formed his own society dance band in Boston in 1919, initially performing at the Brunswick Hotel's Egyptian Room, earning the nickname Hotel Brunswick Orchestra[1][2][3][4].

Reisman's orchestra became one of the most popular on the East Coast in the 1920s and early 1930s, known for its refined string-heavy sound dubbed 'The String Quartet of Dance Bands' by Jerome Kern. The band moved to New York City's Central Park Casino in 1929, later to the Waldorf-Astoria's Sert Room in 1937, and toured Europe, including the Paris International Exposition and Monte Carlo. Reisman recorded prolifically for Columbia (1921-1929), Victor (1929-1933, 1937-1942), Brunswick (1933-1937), and Decca (1942 onward), scoring over 80 hits like 'Night and Day,' 'The Continental,' 'Cheek to Cheek' (with Fred Astaire), and 'Ain't Misbehavin'.' Primarily a dance orchestra with minimal jazz leanings, it occasionally featured hotter elements through musicians like Bubber Miley[1][2][3][4][5].

Reisman frequently spotlighted Broadway stars and emerging talents as vocalists, including discovering Eddy Duchin and Dinah Shore. His radio presence included the Nine O'Clock Revue, Pond’s Cold Cream Hour, Schaefer Beer Program, Philip Morris Show, and Lucky Strike Hit Parade. He died in New York City in 1961 at age 64, leaving a legacy as a premier sweet dance band leader[1][2][3][5].
