# Elmo & Patsy

## Quick Info

- **Origin**: Lexington, Kentucky, United States

## Biography
Elmo & Patsy was a comedy-bluegrass duo consisting of Elmo Shropshire (Dr. Elmo) and his then-wife Patsy Trigg, who performed together primarily in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Elmo Shropshire, a Lexington, Kentucky native, worked as a veterinarian by day while pursuing music on the side, performing novelty and comedy songs in an Americana lounge act. The couple toured the casino circuit, where Shropshire honed his claw-hammer guitar skills and distinctive raspy, woodsmoke voice. They became known for their comedic stage presence, with Trigg delivering humorous put-downs of Shropshire in a dynamic reminiscent of Sonny & Cher, though both were highly talented musicians rooted in bluegrass traditions.

The duo achieved unexpected fame through their 1979 recording of "Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer," a novelty Christmas song written by Randy Brooks that they encountered during a December 1978 performance at the Hyatt in Lake Tahoe, where Brooks had been stranded by a blizzard. After performing the song at their show, they recorded a version on a cassette recorder in their hotel room and later pressed 500 vinyl 45s as gag gifts. The song became a regional sensation when a San Francisco DJ played it, eventually reaching No. 1 on the Billboard Christmas Hot 100 chart in 1983, surpassing classics like Bing Crosby's "White Christmas." The duo's success led to a distribution deal with Nationwide Sound for 250,000 copies of the 45, a 1983 music video that received heavy MTV rotation, and a full-length holiday album released by Epic Records.

Despite their novelty hit's enduring legacy, Elmo & Patsy's partnership was short-lived. The couple divorced in 1990, and their professional relationship dissolved shortly thereafter. A legal battle ensued over publishing rights to "Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer," which had been copyrighted by Patsy's parents through their small music publishing company; a judge ultimately ruled that publishing rights would be split 50/50 between the former partners. Patsy Trigg retired from music following the split, while Elmo Shropshire continued his career as Dr. Elmo, recording a solo version of their signature song to avoid splitting royalties and releasing numerous subsequent holiday albums. The song itself became a cultural phenomenon, spawning a 2000 animated television special, covers by bands including Less Than Jake and Reel Big Fish, and establishing a lasting "Grandma" cottage industry that continues to generate interest decades later.
