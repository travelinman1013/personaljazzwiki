## Biography
Nanci Caroline Griffith (July 6, 1953 – August 13, 2021) was an American singer, songwriter, and guitarist renowned for her poetic storytelling and a style she dubbed 'folkabilly,' blending elements of folk, country, and Americana. Born in Seguin, Texas and raised in Austin, Griffith began performing as a teenager, playing her first professional gig at age 14 and drawing early inspiration from the Texas music scene and artists like Loretta Lynn. She graduated from the University of Texas with a degree in education and spent several years teaching kindergarten and first grade while performing in Austin clubs and honing her songwriting craft[1][3][2].

Griffith released her debut album, 'There's a Light Beyond These Woods,' in 1978, followed by several more on independent labels before moving to Nashville in the mid-1980s. Her career gained momentum with albums such as 'Once in a Very Blue Moon' and 'The Last of the True Believers,' which featured songs that would become hits for other artists. Signing with MCA Records, she expanded her sound and audience, winning a Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album in 1994 for 'Other Voices, Other Rooms,' a tribute to her musical influences. Throughout her career, Griffith was celebrated for her evocative lyrics, crystalline voice, and her ability to bridge genres, leaving a lasting impact on the folk and country music landscapes[1][2][5].

Griffith's legacy endures through her own recordings and the success of songs she wrote for others, such as 'Love at the Five and Dime' and 'Outbound Plane.' She was a frequent collaborator, touring and recording with artists like John Prine, Emmylou Harris, and the Crickets, and was known for her generosity in supporting fellow songwriters. Griffith's influence can be heard in the work of a new generation of Americana and folk musicians, and her songs continue to be covered and celebrated worldwide[1][7][2].
