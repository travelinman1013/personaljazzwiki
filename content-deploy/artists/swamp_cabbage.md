## Biography
Swamp Cabbage is a blues rock trio formed in Jacksonville, Florida, known for their distinctive blend of southern rock, blues, jazz, and comedic storytelling. The band was founded by Walter Parks, a seasoned guitarist and former sideman for folk legend Richie Havens, alongside bassist Matt Lindsey and drummer Jagoda. Their music draws heavily from Parks' North Florida upbringing, weaving together electric guitar stylings reminiscent of Scott Joplin's ragtime and Jerry Reed's bayou picking, all underscored by a rhythm section that channels the spirit of New Orleans jazz.

Emerging in the early 2000s, Swamp Cabbage quickly established a reputation for their complex harmonies and inventive arrangements, described as 'North Florida fatback boogaloo blues.' The group briefly disbanded but reformed during the COVID-19 pandemic, following Lindsey's heart transplant. Their sound is rooted in deep-south traditions, with Parks electrifying hymns, work songs, and reels from Georgia's Okefenokee Swamp—a project that led to his work being archived by the Library of Congress. Swamp Cabbage's legacy lies in their ability to bridge genres while offering a humorous and authentic take on southern life.
