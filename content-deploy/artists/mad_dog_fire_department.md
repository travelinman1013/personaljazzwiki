## Biography
Mad Dog Fire Department is a little-documented funk and disco project best known for their rare 1979 single 'Cosmic Funk.' Emerging during the late 1970s, the group contributed to the vibrant underground funk scene with a sound characterized by grooving basslines, hypnotic chants, and a raw, dancefloor-oriented energy. The project’s music is marked by a blend of cosmic themes and gritty funk instrumentation, making their work a sought-after gem among collectors and DJs.

The group’s most notable track, 'Cosmic Funk,' was arranged and written by Tommy Stewart, a respected figure in the Atlanta funk and soul scene. Stewart’s involvement suggests that Mad Dog Fire Department was likely a studio collective rather than a traditional touring band, with session musicians brought together for this recording. Despite limited releases and little commercial recognition at the time, their music has gained cult status in later decades, especially among rare groove and disco enthusiasts.

While the band’s broader discography and membership remain obscure, the enduring appeal of 'Cosmic Funk' has led to reissues and remixes, keeping the Mad Dog Fire Department name alive in niche music circles. Their legacy is that of a hidden treasure: a fleeting but memorable presence in the golden era of funk and disco.
