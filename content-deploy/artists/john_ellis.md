## Biography
John Ellis is an American saxophonist, clarinetist, and composer widely regarded as one of New York’s premier tenor saxophone voices, known for blending the celebratory spirit of New Orleans with the intensity of the New York scene.[3][4] Raised in rural North Carolina, a few miles outside a tiny town of about 200 people, he was encouraged toward the arts by his mother, an English teacher, and pursued formal training at the University of North Carolina School of the Arts in Winston-Salem.[1][2] In 1993 he moved to New Orleans to study with pianist Ellis Marsalis, absorbing the city’s rhythmic feel and gospel- and funk-inflected traditions, and released his debut album *The Language of Love* in 1996 before relocating to New York City in 1997.[1][2]

Since settling in New York, Ellis has built a dual reputation as an ambitious bandleader and a first-call sideman. He has released more than a dozen albums as a leader (fourteen, by his own site’s count), including projects with his New Orleans-centered band Double-Wide, which has toured extensively and appeared on the main stage of the Newport Jazz Festival in 2012.[1][3][4] As a composer, he has created three large-scale narrative works—*Dreamscapes*, *The Ice Siren*, and *MOBRO*—commissioned by The Jazz Gallery in collaboration with playwright Andy Bragen, with *MOBRO* (2014) using the story of the infamous trash barge to explore environmental themes.[1][3] He has also written music for children and media, co‑producing the *Baby Loves Jazz* series and composing the theme for NPR’s *Rough Translation* podcast.[3][4]

Ellis’s musical style draws on big band language, Brazilian and New Orleans grooves, gospel-tinged funk, and modern jazz harmony, often described as occupying an “imaginary space” between New Orleans warmth and New York edge.[1][3] His robust but flexible tenor sound and rhythmic sophistication have made him a favored collaborator for artists ranging from organ legend Dr. Lonnie Smith to pop icon Sting, leading to more than 150 sideman recording credits.[1][3][4] Recognition includes second place in the 2002 Thelonious Monk International Saxophone Competition and multiple composition grants from The Jazz Gallery, as well as being named the 2014 Make Jazz Fellow by the 18th Street Arts Center in Santa Monica.[1][3][4] Through his recordings, commissions, and teaching, Ellis has become a significant voice in contemporary jazz, particularly in projects that marry narrative concepts with adventurous, groove-oriented writing.[1][3][5]
