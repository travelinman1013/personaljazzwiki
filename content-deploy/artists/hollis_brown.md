## Biography
Hollis Brown is an American rock band from Queens, New York, formed in 2009 by high school friends Mike Montali (lead vocals/guitar) and Jonathan Bonilla (lead guitar), who are second-generation immigrants of Italian-American and Puerto Rican-American descent, respectively. Named after Bob Dylan's 1964 song 'The Ballad of Hollis Brown' from the album *The Times They Are a-Changin'*, the band draws heavily from roots rock, Americana, blues, and classic rock influences, blending them with inventive songwriting and energetic performances that evoke the spirit of 1960s rock while remaining timeless. They began performing in New York clubs, building a regional following before releasing their debut EP *Nothing & the Famous No One* and self-titled album in 2009, both praised for their tight musicianship and sparse production.[1][2]

The band's career gained momentum with their 2013 full-length debut *Ride On the Train*, recorded in Nashville and produced by Adam Landry on Alive Naturalsound Records, followed by extensive touring across the US and Europe supporting acts like Deer Tick, Lucero, Counting Crows, Citizen Cope, The Zombies, Jackie Greene, Heartless Bastards, Rich Robinson of the Black Crowes, and Jesse Malin. Subsequent releases include *3 Shots* (2015), which featured a track built on an unfinished Bo Diddley riff, *Ozone Park* (2019), and tribute albums like *In The Aftermath* (a Stones cover set) and a Record Store Day Velvet Underground tribute. Their music has appeared in films, TV shows such as Showtime’s *Shameless* and DirecTV's *Kingdom*, and trailers, solidifying their indie roots-rock status.[1][2][3][4]

Hollis Brown's evolving lineup reflects their collaborative spirit, with current members including founders Montali and Bonilla alongside Andrew Zehnal (drums, from Cleveland), Adam Bock (keyboards/vocals, from St. Louis), and bassists like Chris Urriola or Brian Courage (from Long Island). Known for adrenaline-fueled live shows at festivals like Firefly and relentless touring, they continue to honor American roots music traditions while pushing forward with original material.[1][2][4]

## Fun Facts
- The band received an unfinished Bo Diddley track from his estate, using it to create 'Rain Dance' on *3 Shots*, which premiered at a 2015 New Orleans event for the 60th anniversary of the 'Bo Diddley Beat'; Mike Montali performed on Diddley's signature red square guitar.
- Mike Montali and Jonathan Bonilla, friends since high school, chose their name not just as a Dylan tribute but because it 'sounded very true to America,' as Bonilla explained.
- Hollis Brown's music has been featured in high-profile media, including the trailer for Michael Keaton's *The Founder*, Willem Dafoe/Matt Dillon's *Bad Country*, Showtime’s *Shameless*, DirecTV's *Kingdom*, MTV’s *Real World*, and an Abercrombie & Fitch ad.
- They recorded their Stones tribute *In The Aftermath* in a single 24-hour session in the Poconos with whiskey, aiming to capture the raw energy of the 1966 original.
