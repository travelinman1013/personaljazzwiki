## Biography
Carey Bell Harrington (November 14, 1936 – May 6, 2007) was a pivotal figure in the Chicago blues scene, renowned for his expressive harmonica playing and soulful vocals. Born in Macon, Mississippi, Bell began playing harmonica as a child, inspired by the sounds of Louis Jordan and blues radio. In his teens, he was mentored by pianist Lovie Lee, who brought him to Chicago in 1956, where Bell quickly immersed himself in the city’s vibrant blues community. There, he learned directly from harmonica greats such as Little Walter, Sonny Boy Williamson II, and especially Big Walter Horton, who became his close friend and mentor.

As the electric guitar began to dominate the Chicago blues sound, Bell adapted by learning bass, performing with artists like Honeyboy Edwards, Earl Hooker, and Eddie Taylor. He soon returned to harmonica, making his recording debut in the late 1960s and releasing his first solo album, 'Carey Bell’s Blues Harp,' in 1969. Bell played with Muddy Waters’ band in the early 1970s and later with Willie Dixon’s Chicago Blues All-Stars, also recording and touring extensively as a solo artist. His style was marked by a robust, 'chopped' phrasing and a deep, emotive approach that honored tradition while remaining contemporary. Over a career spanning five decades, Bell became a sought-after session musician, a respected bandleader, and a mentor to younger players, including his son, guitarist Lurrie Bell. He died of heart failure in Chicago in 2007, leaving a lasting legacy as one of the last great Chicago blues harp masters.
