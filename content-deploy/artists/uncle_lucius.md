## Biography
Uncle Lucius is a Texas-based band formed in Austin in 2005 by Kevin Galloway, a Freeport native who grew up immersed in classic country music and initially pursued a banking career before dedicating himself to music. Galloway moved to Austin, where he met bassist Hal Vorpahl at open-mic nights, and together they began collaborating. The group expanded with guitarist Mike Carpenter and drummer Josh Greco, quickly earning a reputation for their soulful blend of country, blues, and rock, infused with a jam band sensibility that resonated with live audiences. Their debut album, 'Something They Ain't,' arrived in 2006, followed by 'Pick Your Head Up' in 2009, and 'And You Are Me' in 2012, each release showcasing their evolving sound and deepening their roots in the Austin music scene.[1][2][6]

Uncle Lucius became known for their energetic live performances and authentic songwriting, drawing influences from classic Texas country, Southern rock, and blues. Their signature song, 'Keep the Wolves Away,' achieved viral success after being featured in the TV series Yellowstone, earning gold and platinum certifications and expanding their fanbase internationally. The band went on hiatus in 2018 after a farewell tour, but their legacy continued to grow, prompting a reunion and the release of 'Like It's The Last One Left' in 2023, which marked a new chapter with fresh members and a revitalized musical direction.[5][7]

Throughout their career, Uncle Lucius has embodied the spirit of Austin's independent music scene, building a catalog of critically acclaimed albums and cultivating a devoted following. Their music is characterized by heartfelt lyrics, soulful grooves, and a willingness to explore new sonic territories, making them influential figures in the red dirt, Texas country, and outlaw country genres.[1][5][6]
