## Biography
Gianna Brielle "Gigi" Perez, born February 4, 2000, in Hackensack, New Jersey to Cuban parents, is an American singer-songwriter known for her emotionally resonant alternative pop music. Raised in West Palm Beach, Florida, Perez began writing songs at age fifteen and performed in musicals during high school, where she was named homecoming queen in 2017. She briefly attended Berklee College of Music before leaving during the COVID-19 pandemic, and started releasing music in 2018 as part of the band Wendy Lane[3][1][9].

Perez's career accelerated after she began uploading music to TikTok, notably the song "Celene"—written in memory of her late sister—and "Sometimes (Backwood)," which went viral and led to a contract with Interscope Records. Her debut EP, "How To Catch A Falling Knife," released in April 2023, showcased her confessional songwriting and vulnerability, with singles like "Sally," "The Man," and "Figurines." After parting ways with Interscope in early 2024, Perez found even greater success as an independent artist, releasing "Sailor Song," which peaked at #22 on the Billboard Hot 100 and topped charts internationally. Her music often explores themes of grief, sexuality, and self-discovery, drawing from personal experiences and relationships[3][1][4][5].

Perez has performed at major festivals and supported artists such as Coldplay, Noah Cyrus, Girl in Red, d4vd, and Hozier on tour. Her style blends alternative pop with acoustic indie elements, marked by raw lyricism and cathartic storytelling. Now based in Brooklyn, she continues to release self-written and self-produced tracks, earning recognition as an LGBTQ icon and a rising voice in contemporary music[3][6][9].
