## Biography
Sneaky Pete Kleinow (born August 20, 1934, South Bend, Indiana – died January 6, 2007) was a pioneering American pedal steel guitarist and animator, best known for his foundational role in the development of country rock. Inspired by steel guitar legend Jerry Byrd, Kleinow took up the instrument in high school and, after a decade working for the Michigan Department of Transportation, moved to Los Angeles in 1963. There, he launched a dual career: by day, he worked as a stop-motion animator on projects like 'Gumby' and 'Davey and Goliath,' and by night, he played in local country bands, quickly earning a reputation for his innovative style and technical prowess.[1][3][5]

Kleinow’s big break came in 1968 when he joined Gram Parsons and Chris Hillman to form the Flying Burrito Brothers, helping to define the sound of country rock with his adventurous use of the pedal steel guitar. He was known for incorporating electronic effects—such as fuzzboxes and Leslie speakers—into his playing, which brought a new, psychedelic edge to the traditionally plaintive instrument. Beyond the Burritos, Kleinow became a sought-after session musician, contributing to recordings by artists as diverse as the Byrds, the Rolling Stones, John Lennon, Stevie Wonder, Linda Ronstadt, and Joni Mitchell. His work expanded the pedal steel’s role in popular music, influencing a generation of musicians and earning him induction into the Steel Guitar Hall of Fame.[1][2][3]

Kleinow’s legacy is twofold: as a musical innovator who brought the pedal steel guitar to rock audiences, and as a creative force in visual effects, contributing to iconic films like 'The Empire Strikes Back' and 'The Terminator.' His unorthodox approach and willingness to experiment left an indelible mark on both music and animation, making him one of the most versatile and influential figures in American pop culture.[1][2][3]
