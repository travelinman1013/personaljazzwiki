## Biography
David Murray, born February 19, 1955, in Oakland, California, began his musical journey studying piano before switching to alto saxophone and then tenor saxophone in the early 1970s. He attended Pomona College, where he was inspired by professor Stanley Crouch to pursue music and journalism, interviewing figures like Cecil Taylor and Ornette Coleman, but ultimately followed Dewey Redman's advice to focus on his saxophone. Moving to New York City in 1975, Murray immersed himself in the loft-jazz scene, co-leading a trio with Phillip Wilson and Olu Dara, and quickly established himself as a prominent saxophonist and bandleader.[1][2][3][4]

Murray's career exploded in the late 1970s as a founding member of the World Saxophone Quartet (WSQ) alongside Oliver Lake, Julius Hemphill, and Hamiet Bluiett, which toured and recorded for 40 years, revolutionizing jazz with explorative originals and reinterpretations of R&B and Ellington. Over five decades, he has released over 200 albums under his own name, blending free jazz, avant-garde, hard bop, and mainstream influences from Albert Ayler, Ornette Coleman, Archie Shepp, Coleman Hawkins, Ben Webster, and Paul Gonsalves. His style features instantly recognizable improvisation, circular breathing for long phrases, and compositions performed by various ensembles from trios to octets and big bands.[1][2][3][4][5]

A prolific composer and arranger honoring jazz traditions with gospel, R&B, and poetry infusions, Murray has collaborated with Max Roach, Randy Weston, Pharoah Sanders, McCoy Tyner, and others. Living in New York City, his legacy includes recent acclaimed works like the 2024 album Francesca (#2 Best Jazz Album by New York Times) and an upcoming 2025 Verve release, cementing his status as a jazz master reconciling swing to free jazz.[1][2][6]
