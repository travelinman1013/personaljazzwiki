## Biography
Jamie O'Neal, born Jamie Murphy on June 3, 1968, in Sydney, Australia, grew up in a musical family as the daughter of professional musicians Jimmy and Julie Murphy. Alongside her parents and younger sister Samantha, she performed in The Murphy Family band during the 1970s, releasing three self-released albums before her parents' divorce led her to move to Los Angeles with her father. Dropping out of high school, O'Neal pursued music in Nashville, working as a demo singer and securing a songwriting contract with producer Harold Shedd in 1996, followed by an artist-development deal with EMI Music. Her songs were covered by artists like LeAnn Rimes and Chely Wright, and she provided backing vocals for acts including Clay Davidson and Ronnie Milsap.[1][2]

O'Neal's breakthrough came in 2000 when she signed with Mercury Nashville, releasing her debut album *Shiver*, which featured back-to-back No. 1 singles 'There Is No Arizona' and 'When I Think About Angels,' earning three Grammy nominations and a win for Top New Female Vocalist at the 2001 Academy of Country Music Awards. After parting with Mercury, she joined Capitol Nashville for her 2005 album *Brave*, highlighted by the Top 10 hit 'Somebody's Hero.' Known for her country-pop style blending heartfelt storytelling with emotive vocals, O'Neal later founded Momentum Label Group in 2012, signing artist Rachele Lynae, and released albums like *Eternal* (2014, Shanachie Records), *Sometimes* (2020), and *Spirit & Joy* (2023).[1][2][3]

Her career reflects resilience, from early backup singing on Kylie Minogue's 1990 Enjoy Yourself Tour and 1991 Let's Get To It Tour to independent ventures and ongoing tours, establishing her as a platinum-selling artist with a lasting presence in country music.[1][2]
