## Biography
Fritzel's New Orleans Jazz Band is the resident ensemble at Fritzel's European Jazz Pub, a historic venue in New Orleans' French Quarter established in October 1969 within an 1831 building on the 700 block of Bourbon Street. The band embodies the exuberant, traditional New Orleans jazz style, performing nightly with high energy, spontaneity, and audience interaction in an intimate, immersive setting that has made the club a mecca for jazz lovers worldwide.[1][2][5] Their music features upbeat ragtime and Dixieland influences, capturing the joie de vivre of the city through foot-stomping rhythms and raucous live atmospheres.[1][2]

The band's career is tied to the pub's legacy as a hub for jam sessions and traditional jazz, where musicians from across the country and globe congregate without prior rehearsal, often taking audience song requests. In 2009, they released a studio album titled *Fritzel's New Orleans Jazz Band*, featuring 15 classic tunes like 'Bourbon Street Parade' and 'When the Saints Go Marching In,' recorded by top performers from the club to bottle its live magic.[1] The rotating lineup ensures fresh interpretations of standards, maintaining the club's reputation for joyful, soul-stirring performances seven nights a week.[2][6]

Fritzel's band has left a lasting legacy as a preserver of authentic New Orleans jazz amid Bourbon Street's bustle, fostering a 'home away from home' for fans and players. Their influence endures through the pub's continuous operation, even post-hardships like hurricanes, symbolizing resilience and the city's jazz heritage.[2][4]
