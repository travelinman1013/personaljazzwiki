## Biography
Ida Cox, born Ida Prather on February 25, 1894, in Toccoa, Georgia, was a pioneering blues singer and vaudeville performer who helped found the female blues genre alongside Gertrude 'Ma' Rainey and Bessie Smith[3][4][8]. Raised in Cedartown, she sang in her church choir before leaving home as a teenager to tour with minstrel revues such as the White and Clark's Black & Tan Minstrels and the Rabbit Foot Minstrels[8]. Her early career was shaped by the vibrant Southern tent show and vaudeville circuit, where she developed her commanding stage presence and business acumen.

Cox made her first blues recordings in 1923 for Paramount Records, including 'Graveyard Dream Blues' and 'Weary Way Blues,' and quickly rose to prominence as the 'Uncrowned Queen of the Blues'[3][4][5]. Over the next six years, she recorded nearly ninety songs, many of which she wrote herself, such as the enduring 'Wild Women Don't Have the Blues.' Her music often addressed themes relevant to Black women, touching on social issues, sexual freedom, and dignity. Cox was known for managing her own touring company, Raisin' Cain, and producing her own stage shows, a rarity for women in her era[4][6].

Her career spanned vaudeville, blues, and jazz, collaborating with notable musicians like Jelly Roll Morton and Lovie Austin[4][5]. Cox performed at prestigious venues, including Carnegie Hall in 1939 as part of John Hammond's 'From Spirituals to Swing' concert[4][6]. After suffering a stroke in 1945, she retired from touring but made her final recording, 'Blues for Rampart Street,' in 1961. Ida Cox's legacy endures as a trailblazer who gave voice to the experiences of Black women and helped shape the classic blues era[3][4][6].
