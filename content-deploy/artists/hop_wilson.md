## Biography
Harding "Hop" Wilson (April 27, 1921 – August 27, 1975) was an American Texas blues musician born in Grapeland, Texas, in Houston County.[1][4] Named after President Warren G. Harding, his nickname derived from his pronunciation of "harp" as "hop," reflecting his early mastery of the harmonica.[1] Wilson acquired his first steel guitar between ages 12 and 18 and became known for his powerful singing voice and distinctive slide guitar work.[1] He performed at various Houston clubs as a teenager and worked odd jobs throughout the 1930s and early 1940s before being drafted into the United States Army in 1942, serving until his discharge in 1946.[1]

After returning to Crockett, Wilson pursued a serious career as a blues musician, eventually joining drummer "King" Ivory Lee Semien in the mid-1950s.[1] Together they worked clubs throughout East Texas and Louisiana, recording for Goldband Records in Lake Charles, Louisiana in 1957.[1] Their wild, rough-edged style produced regional hits like "Chicken Stuff" and "Rockin' in the Coconut Top," though they never achieved national chart success.[1] Wilson led his own sessions beginning in 1960 with the Ivory record label, recording until 1961, after which he concentrated on playing local Houston clubs and bars.[1] Though virtually unknown outside Houston, he was a local sensation who influenced numerous modern guitarists through his mastery of the eight-string Hawaiian steel guitar, which he helped popularize throughout the South during the 1940s and 1950s.[1]

Wilson continued performing in Houston until August 1975, when he was admitted to a V.A. hospital in a confused state and diagnosed with brain damage due to oxygen deprivation, likely from a stroke.[1] He died on August 27, 1975, from respiratory arrest and was buried at Mount Zion Cemetery in Grapeland, less than two miles from his birthplace.[1] Though his recording career was characterized as "slight," his unique slide stylings and innovative approach to the steel guitar left a lasting impact on blues music and influenced numerous musicians across generations.[1]

## Fun Facts
- Wilson's nickname "Hop" came from his pronunciation of "harp" as "hop," derived from his early mastery of the harmonica.[1]
- His low-sounding steel guitar playing gave even cheerful songs like "Merry Christmas Darling" a morose, disillusioned feel.[1]
- Wilson was a disabled veteran who preferred sitting down while playing, which influenced his choice to master the lap-steel guitar rather than the standard upright instrument.[2]
- Though his recording output was minimal (only five singles total), his entire recorded output has been reissued primarily on European labels, with much previously unreleased material considered remarkable by blues enthusiasts.[2]
