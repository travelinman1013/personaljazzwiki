## Biography
Isidore 'Tuts' Washington, born January 24, 1907, in New Orleans, Louisiana, was a pioneering blues and boogie-woogie pianist who largely taught himself piano starting at age 10. Inspired by local brass bands and itinerant musician Joseph Louis 'Red' Cayou, whom he studied under, Washington quickly became a prodigy known as 'Papa Yellow.' By his teens, he surpassed most barrelhouse pianists, blending ragtime, jazz, blues, and occasional bawdy vocals while sitting in with Dixieland and society bands. He quit school after sixth grade to pursue music full-time, performing in New Orleans clubs and barrooms along South Rampart Street during the 1920s and 1930s.[1][2][4][5][6]

After World War II, Washington joined singer-guitarist Smiley Lewis in a trio with drummer Herman Seals, recording landmark New Orleans R&B tracks like 'Tee-Nah-Nah,' 'The Bells Are Ringing,' and 'Dirty People' for Imperial Records before their 1952 breakup. He briefly relocated to St. Louis in 1950 to play with the Tab Smith Orchestra, then returned to New Orleans by the late 1950s, performing at French Quarter spots like Tipitina's, the Court of Two Sisters, the Pontchartrain Hotel's Caribbean Room, and on the Delta Queen steamboat. He also worked with the Clyde Kerr Orchestra and Papa Celestin, adapting his style for tourists while maintaining his eclectic mix of boogie-woogie, barrelhouse, R&B, gospel, and jazz.[1][2][4][5]

Washington avoided recording throughout most of his career, prioritizing live performances, but released the solo album *New Orleans Piano Professor* on Rounder Records in 1983 at age 76, showcasing his vast repertoire from spirituals to pop. A live album, *Live at Tipitina's '78*, surfaced posthumously in 1998. He died on August 5, 1984, from a heart attack while performing at the New Orleans World's Fair, cementing his legacy as a foundational influence on Crescent City pianists.[1][2][5]
