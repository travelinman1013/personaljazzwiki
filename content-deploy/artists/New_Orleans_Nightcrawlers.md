## Biography

The New Orleans Nightcrawlers are a renowned brass band based in New Orleans, Louisiana, founded in 1994 by pianist Tom McDermott, sousaphonist Matt Perrine, and trumpeter Kevin Clark. Conceived as a writer’s workshop for brass band music, the group quickly distinguished itself with sophisticated arrangements and an innovative approach to the traditional New Orleans brass band sound. The original lineup featured some of the city’s most accomplished musicians, including Barney Floyd, Frank Oxley, Mark Morris, Peter Kaplan, Craig Klein, Rick Trolsen, Eric Traub, Ken 'Snakebite' Jacobs, Jason Mingledorff, and Satoru Ohashi.

Over the years, the Nightcrawlers have become a staple of the New Orleans music scene, performing at Jazzfest for over two decades and touring internationally in Japan, Brazil, Europe, and across the United States. Their 2020 album, 'Atmosphere,' won the Grammy Award for Best Regional Roots Music Album, a major milestone that brought national recognition during the challenging pandemic period. Their follow-up, 'Too Much to Hold,' was also Grammy-nominated in 2023. The band’s music blends traditional jazz, modern funk, Latin influences, and intricate horn arrangements, creating a sound that is both rooted in New Orleans tradition and refreshingly contemporary. Their legacy is marked by their ability to bridge generations of musicians and audiences, as well as their collaborations with a diverse array of artists from the local and national scenes.

## Fun Facts
- The band was featured in Season 29 of The Simpsons, highlighting their cultural impact beyond the music world.
- Their 2020 Grammy-winning album 'Atmosphere' took 11 years to complete due to the members' busy schedules with other projects.
- The Nightcrawlers were originally conceived as a writer’s workshop, not as a performing band, but quickly became a working ensemble.
- Longtime drummer Kerry 'Fatman' Hunter tragically died during Mardi Gras 2024 after being struck by a drunk driver.
