## Biography
Slave was a pioneering American post-hardcore band formed in Sacramento, California, in 2014. The group was founded by vocalist Jonny Craig, known for his work with Dance Gavin Dance and Emarosa, alongside guitarist Alex Lyman. Their debut album, 'Through Art We Are All Equals,' was released in 2014 and quickly established their reputation for blending emotionally charged vocals with intricate guitar work and dynamic rhythms. Over the years, the band underwent several lineup changes, but maintained a core sound rooted in melodic post-hardcore, alternative rock, and R&B influences.

Slave's music was characterized by Craig's soulful, expressive vocals and the band's willingness to experiment with genre conventions, incorporating elements of pop, electronic, and even hip-hop into their sound. Their lyrics often explored themes of personal struggle, addiction, and redemption, resonating with a devoted fanbase. Despite facing controversy and multiple member departures, the band continued to release new material and tour extensively until 2021, when they officially changed their name to Rain City Drive in response to growing concerns about the original band name's connotations.

The legacy of Slave lies in their ability to bridge the gap between post-hardcore and mainstream alternative music, influencing a new generation of artists who value both technical musicianship and emotional honesty. Their discography remains a testament to their resilience and adaptability within a rapidly evolving music scene.
