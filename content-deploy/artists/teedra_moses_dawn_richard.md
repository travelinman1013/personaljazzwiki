## Biography
Teedra Moses is an R&B artist from New Orleans who released her critically acclaimed debut album Complex Simplicity in 2004, which established her as a distinctive voice in contemporary R&B. The album featured hits like "Be Your Girl" and "You'll Never Find (A Better Woman)," songs that became cult classics for their combination of honesty, attitude, and vulnerability. Her work has been widely regarded as one of the best R&B albums of its era, with its influence echoing through today's alternative soul and neo-R&B movements. Moses's musical style is characterized by a playful, Caribbean-tinged vocal delivery and themes exploring longing, lust, and self-assured sensuality.

Over two decades following her debut, Moses has continued to evolve as an artist while maintaining the essence of her original sound. In 2025, she released Complex Simplicity (Reimagined), an EP that revisits her most beloved tracks from her first project, demonstrating her growth and maturity as both a woman and musician. The reimagined versions showcase a more stripped-down, sensual approach compared to the original hip-hop-influenced bounce of the 2004 recordings. Moses has been intentional about preserving the core essence of her work, refusing to alter lyrics in ways that would compromise the original intent, instead focusing on rearranging musical elements to reflect her evolved perspective.

- Moses has a long-standing friendship with Estelle that extends beyond music, with the two having 'real grown-woman conversations' and sharing similar life perspectives that informed their collaborative work on the reimagined track.
- When recording the 'Doin' You' collaboration, Moses and Estelle joked about using AI makeup in photos due to the casual, laid-back studio atmosphere filled with laughter, reflecting their comfortable working relationship and humorous approach to the creative process.
- Moses is intentional about preserving the original lyrics and essence of her 2004 tracks when reimagining them, viewing the process as 'rearranging pieces' rather than fundamentally altering the songs, ensuring listeners can still recognize the original intent and meaning.
