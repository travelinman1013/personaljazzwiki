## Biography
Eli Hudnall Cook was born on April 24, 1986, in Nelson County, Virginia, where he grew up immersed in a rural world of old cars, chainsaws, and guitars. He emerged as a young blues artist with a distinctive bone-shaking growl and bonafide blues guitar chops, earning recognition from fans and critics as a torch bearer for historical blues players. Based in Charlottesville, Virginia, Cook developed a substantial following and established steady performance venues in the Washington D.C. area and beyond.

Cook's musical style represents an eclectic blend drawing from the crossroads of blues, the highways of rock, and the backroads of country music. His deep, rich baritone voice combined with masterful guitar work has earned him national acclaim. He recorded and released his first two albums between 2004 and 2007, beginning with the all-acoustic, original-roots album "Miss Blues' Child" on the Sledgehammer Blues label. His genre-blending approach and gritty vocal delivery have established him as a distinctive voice in contemporary blues and blues rock.
