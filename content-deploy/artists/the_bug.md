## Biography
Kevin Richard Martin, best known by his recording alias The Bug, is an English musician and producer whose career spans over three decades. Born in Weymouth, England, Martin moved to London around 1990, immersing himself in the city’s vibrant and experimental music scene. His early years saw him exploring avant-garde jazz, noise rock, and industrial hip hop through bands like GOD and Techno Animal, often collaborating with Justin Broadrick. Martin’s relentless drive to push boundaries led him to absorb influences from dub, reggae, dancehall, and the emerging sounds of jungle and dubstep, which became foundational to his later work.

The Bug project emerged in the late 1990s, initially as a vehicle for Martin’s fascination with Jamaican music and its intersection with British underground culture. The Bug’s sound is characterized by heavy bass, aggressive rhythms, and a fusion of dancehall, dubstep, and industrial textures. Notable releases like 'Pressure' (2003), 'London Zoo' (2008), and 'Angels & Devils' (2014) received critical acclaim for their innovative approach and powerful collaborations with vocalists from the UK and Jamaica. Martin’s other major project, King Midas Sound, further showcased his versatility, blending dub with melancholic songwriting alongside poet Roger Robinson and singer Kiki Hitomi.

Martin’s legacy is marked by his role as a curator and collaborator, constantly evolving his sonic palette and championing underground sounds. His work as The Bug has influenced a generation of producers and artists in electronic, dub, and experimental music, earning him a reputation as a master of genre fusion and a provocateur in the world of sound.
