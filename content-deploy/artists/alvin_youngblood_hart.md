## Biography
Alvin Youngblood Hart, born Gregory Edward Hart on March 2, 1963, in Oakland, California, is a Grammy Award-winning American musician celebrated for his mastery of country blues and his eclectic approach to American roots music. Spending parts of his youth in Carroll County, Mississippi, Hart absorbed the Mississippi country blues tradition from his relatives, which became a cornerstone of his musical identity. His early years also included a stint in the Coast Guard, where he often practiced guitar while stationed along the Mississippi River, experiences that would later inspire his songwriting.

Hart emerged in the 1990s as a leading figure among a new generation of blues artists, releasing his debut album, 'Big Mama's Door,' in 1996. The album earned him the W.C. Handy Award for Best New Artist and established his reputation for authentic yet adventurous interpretations of blues, country, and rock. Hart's subsequent albums, including 'Territory' (1998), 'Start with the Soul' (2000), and 'Down in the Alley' (2002), further showcased his versatility as a guitarist, singer, and multi-instrumentalist. His work has been recognized with numerous accolades, including a Grammy Award in 2005 for his contribution to the compilation 'Beautiful Dreamer: The Songs of Stephen Foster.'

Known as a 'musician's musician,' Hart's style bridges the gap between traditional country blues, 1960s and 1970s guitar rock, western swing, and even reggae, drawing comparisons to legends like Lead Belly and Spade Cooley. His influence extends beyond performance, as he has inspired both peers and younger musicians with his commitment to personal expression and musical exploration. Hart remains a vital force in contemporary blues, praised by artists such as Taj Mahal, Bob Dylan, Eric Clapton, and Mick Taylor.
