## Biography
Mike Hurst, born in 1942 or 1943, began his musical journey as a singer, songwriter, and guitarist from the age of 13, immersed in music from early childhood through his mother's theatre group. In 1958, he auditioned for Jack Good’s *Oh Boy!* show, receiving encouragement from Eddie Cochran despite not being selected due to his unbroken voice, and was later made the first honorary member of the Official Elvis Presley Fan Club. After failing an EMI audition in 1960 and briefly working in insurance, his mother secured him a spot in The Springfields in February 1962, replacing Tim Field; the group achieved major success with hits like 'Silver Threads and Golden Needles' (first UK vocal group Top 10 in the US) and 'Island of Dreams,' earning NME Best British Vocal Group awards in 1962 and 1963 before disbanding in 1963.[1][2][5]

Transitioning to production and performance, Hurst formed The Methods in 1964 with Jimmy Page, Albert Lee on guitar, and Tony Ashton on keyboards, playing country rock ahead of its time. He produced early sessions for Marc Bolan ('The Wizard'), discovered and produced Cat Stevens' initial Deram hits like 'Matthew and Son,' and worked with artists including P.P. Arnold, The Move, Manfred Mann, and Spencer Davis Group. In 1970-1971, he recorded solo albums for Capitol with Elton John band members and others; by 1973, his Solid Gold production company yielded US hits for Fancy ('Wild Thing,' 'Touch Me') and a string of 17 UK Top 40 singles for Showaddywaddy. He managed and produced Shakin' Stevens' early hit 'Hot Dog' in 1978, headed Lamborghini Records in 1984 (discovering Samantha Fox), and formed Sundance with Mary Hopkin and Mike de Albuquerque.[1][2]

In later decades, Hurst produced Belle & Sebastian (2002), his son Jonas's band (2007), and pursued education through Rockmaster rock schools and 'The Music Makers' lectures on 450 years of popular music across UK schools. He received a Gold Badge Award in 1998 for lifetime achievement and entered the Guinness Book of World Records in 1999 with a family stage production featuring 23 relatives, surpassing the Redgrave family record. His style spans rock 'n' roll, folk-pop, and production across genres, leaving a legacy as a versatile figure bridging performance and production in British music history.[1][2]
