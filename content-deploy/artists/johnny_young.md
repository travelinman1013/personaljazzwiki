## Biography
Johnny Young was born Johnny Benjamin Arthur de Jong on 12 March 1947 in Rotterdam, Netherlands, and migrated to Western Australia with his family at age three, growing up on a farm in Kalamunda in the Perth Hills. He began his entertainment career early, performing solo songs in specially made jackets at Saturday morning radio shows as a child. After leaving school, he worked as a trainee disc jockey and started singing at local dances, eventually becoming the lead vocalist of The Nomads (later known as The Strangers) from age 14 for 18 months. At eighteen, he hosted the TVW-7 Perth television pop music show Club Seventeen in early 1965, launching his path to stardom.

Young's breakthrough came in 1966 when he formed Johnny Young & Kompany and recorded "Step Back," co-written by The Easybeats' Stevie Wright and George Young, which became a number-one hit alongside a cover of the Strangeloves' "Cara-lyn." During this period, he concurrently hosted the TV pop music program The Go!! Show and achieved further success with a slower version of The Beatles' "All My Loving," which reached number four nationally in May and became his signature song. He toured with the Rolling Stones and supported Roy Orbison, while also meeting Barry Gibb of the Bee Gees in Brisbane and providing crucial support for Gibb's career development. Young's pop career spanned three frantic years as one of Australia's top beat performers in the 1960s, though his attempt to break into the UK scene proved unsuccessful.

After his pop career faltered, Young transitioned into multiple entertainment roles, becoming a radio DJ, television presenter, songwriter, and record and television producer. He joined Melbourne's 3XY radio station in April 1968 as the drive-time host and released his last Top 40 single "It's a Sunny Day" in mid-1968. Young became a prolific songwriter, composing hits for other artists including Russell Morris' "The Real Thing" and "Part Three Into Paper Walls," Ronnie Burns' "Smiley," and Lionel Rose's "I Thank You"—all national number-one singles. He later became best known as the gentle, ever-smiling host of Young Talent Time, establishing himself as a significant figure in Australian entertainment across multiple decades.
