## Biography
Larry Willis was an American jazz pianist and composer, born Lawrence Elliott Willis on December 20, 1942, in Harlem, New York City. Raised in a household steeped in European classical music, Willis initially aspired to be a classical vocalist and studied voice and music theory at the Manhattan School of Music. However, his musical trajectory shifted toward jazz in his late teens, inspired by the vibrant Harlem scene and the encouragement of peers and mentors. By his senior year of high school, Willis was already performing professionally on piano, despite being largely self-taught on the instrument.

Willis's professional breakthrough came when alto saxophonist Jackie McLean invited him to join his band in 1962, leading to Willis's first jazz recording on McLean's 'Right Now!' in 1965, which also featured two of Willis's compositions. Over a career spanning more than five decades, Willis became known for his versatility, performing and recording in styles ranging from hard bop and soul jazz to jazz fusion and Afro-Cuban jazz. He worked with a remarkable array of artists, including Hugh Masekela, Cannonball Adderley, Stan Getz, Woody Shaw, Blood, Sweat & Tears, and Carmen McRae, and appeared on more than 300 recordings, including over 20 as a leader. Willis's playing was celebrated for its lyricism, rhythmic drive, and ability to elevate any ensemble, earning him a reputation as a 'born accompanist.'

Willis's legacy is marked by his adaptability, deep musicality, and commitment to both tradition and innovation. He influenced generations of musicians through his performances, recordings, and mentorship, leaving an indelible mark on the jazz world before his death in Baltimore, Maryland, on September 29, 2019.
