# James brown and the FAmous Flames

## Biography
James Joseph Brown, born in poverty in Barnwell, South Carolina, endured a tumultuous early life marked by street crimes, leading to his arrest at age 15 or 16 for offenses including armed robbery and car break-ins. Sentenced to 8-16 years at a juvenile detention center (Alto Reform School), he was released after three years for good behavior and formed his first musical group, the Swanees, using makeshift instruments, earning the nickname 'Music Box'. In 1953, at age 20, he joined Bobby Byrd's gospel group the Gospel Starlighters in Toccoa, Georgia, which evolved through names like the Avons, Five Royals, and Flames before becoming the Famous Flames, shifting to rhythm and blues.[1][2][3][4][5][6]

Brown emerged as lead singer, gaining national attention with the 1956 hit 'Please, Please, Please' after a live performance caught the ear of King Records executive Syd Nathan; this launched relentless touring (up to 350 shows yearly) and hits like 'Try Me' (1958, #1 R&B). Initially a vocal harmony group, the Famous Flames became associated with Brown's dynamic performances backed by his instrumental band (James Brown Band/Orchestra). Internal tensions arose as Brown took top billing, leading to lineup changes—original members like Byrd left in 1957, replacements like Lloyd Stallworth joined, and by 1968, the group disbanded amid disputes over compensation and Brown's solo ascent with funk innovations like 'Out of Sight'.[1][2][4][5]

Known as the Godfather of Soul and progenitor of funk, Brown's raw, emotive vocals, electrifying dance moves, and high-energy shows defined his style, blending gospel, R&B, soul, and blues. His legacy endures as a 20th-century music titan, influencing generations despite personal and group challenges; the Famous Flames were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2012.[1][4][6]

## Fun Facts
- Brown's first instruments in juvenile detention were makeshift: comb and paper, washtub bass, lard tub drums, and a wooden box mandolin, earning him the nickname 'Music Box'.
- The Famous Flames toured up to 350 one-nighters per year from the late 1950s to mid-1970s, building Brown's reputation as a dynamic live performer.
- Record label billing inconsistencies led fans to mistakenly think the Famous Flames were Brown's backing band, rather than a standalone vocal group.
- Bobby Byrd, group founder, was posthumously inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2012 with the Famous Flames and received a 1998 Rhythm and Blues Pioneer Award.
