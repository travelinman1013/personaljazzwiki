## Biography
Sierra Green is a dynamic soul, blues, and R&B vocalist born and raised in the culturally rich 7th Ward of New Orleans. Immersed in music from an early age, she began singing in the church choir at just eight years old, later performing at family gatherings and school talent shows. Her early exposure to gospel and the vibrant musical traditions of her neighborhood deeply influenced her vocal style and artistic direction[1][2][4].

As a teenager, Green honed her craft by busking on Frenchmen Street, a renowned hub for live music in New Orleans. This experience taught her how to captivate diverse audiences and led to residencies at some of the city's top clubs, earning her the title 'Queen of Frenchmen Street.' Over time, she assembled a group of top local musicians, forming Sierra Green & the Giants, and collaborated with legendary producer Dave Torkanowsky. Her debut album with the Giants, 'Here We Are,' showcases her powerful, emotive vocals and blends classic soul with contemporary New Orleans influences[1][2][3][5][6].

Green's music is characterized by passionate performances, a gravelly vocal timbre, and a deep connection to the city's musical heritage. She is celebrated for her ability to channel the spirit of 1960s Motown legends while infusing her work with the unique rhythms and energy of New Orleans. Her legacy is growing as she continues to inspire audiences and collaborate with some of the region's finest musicians[1][3][5][7].
