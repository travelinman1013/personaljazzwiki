## Biography
Norrie Cox was a British-born clarinetist and bandleader devoted to the classic New Orleans jazz tradition. As a young man in England, he led his own San Jacinto Jazz Band during the traditional jazz boom of the late 1950s and early 1960s, building a reputation for authentic ensemble playing and a deep feel for early jazz repertoire.[5] He eventually emigrated to the United States, where he became known on the Midwest and New Orleans revival circuits for his warm, singing clarinet tone, his unmistakable British accent, and a white goatee that made him a recognizable figure at traditional jazz festivals and club dates.[6]

In the U.S., Cox’s main vehicle was **Norrie Cox & His New Orleans Stompers**, a band dedicated to preserving the ensemble sound and repertoire of early New Orleans bands. The group recorded albums such as *Dance Hall Days* (released by Delmark in 1999) and *Move The Body Over*, featuring classic tunes like “When I Leave the World Behind” and other standards associated with the dance‑hall era.[1][7][8] Cox’s leadership emphasized collective improvisation over solo virtuosity, reflecting his commitment to the pre‑bebop idiom and to the spirit of bands like those of Louis Armstrong and King Oliver.[6][7] His work with the Stompers, together with decades of live performances, positioned him as a respected keeper of the New Orleans style within the international traditional jazz community.

Cox’s legacy rests on his role as an articulate and steadfast advocate for early New Orleans jazz. Obituary and tribute material highlight his lifelong dedication to historically informed performance and his refusal to dilute the idiom with more modern jazz trends, presenting him as a culture‑bearer who helped sustain interest in classic jazz well into the late 20th century.[6] Through his bands, recordings, and festival appearances, he influenced younger traditional players and reinforced a transatlantic link between the British trad boom and American revival scenes, ensuring that the ensemble‑driven New Orleans sound remained a living practice rather than a museum piece.[5][6]
