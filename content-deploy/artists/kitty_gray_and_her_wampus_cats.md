## Biography
Very little is known about Kitty Gray’s life beyond a brief but noteworthy appearance on record in San Antonio, Texas in 1937. Contemporary discographical research identifies her as an African American pianist and singer who led a small group billed as **Kitty Gray & Her Wampus Cats**, active—at least in the recording studio—in the late 1930s.[1][2][6] On October 30–31, 1937, she recorded a series of sides for the Vocalion label in San Antonio, placing her within the Texas blues and ragtime-blues recording scene of that era.[1][2][6]

The Wampus Cats sessions show Gray fronting a combo that blended **ragtime, blues, and early swing elements**, with piano-led rhythms, slide guitar, scrub-board percussion, and occasional mandolin.[1][2][7][9] Discographical notes and later commentary agree that guitar on these records was "probably" or "almost certainly" provided by the Louisiana–Texas slide guitarist Oscar "Buddy" Woods, an important figure in the Texas–Louisiana slide guitar tradition.[2][7][9] Titles such as **"Baton Rouge Rag"** and **"Round and Round"** exhibit a ragtime-derived rhythmic feel combined with blues phrasing, placing Gray stylistically in what later writers have called *ragtime blues*.[1][3][5][7] Despite the musical quality and historical interest of these sides, no firm documentation has surfaced regarding her birth, background, or activities outside the 1937 session, and there is no evidence of a long recording career; her legacy today rests almost entirely on this small but distinctive body of work preserved on 78 rpm records and modern reissues.[1][2][6][7][9]

## Fun Facts
- Kitty Gray & Her Wampus Cats recorded roughly ten titles over just two days (October 30–31, 1937) in San Antonio for Vocalion, making her recorded legacy both compact and historically well‑defined.[1][2]
- "Baton Rouge Rag"—one of her key titles—was not issued on 78 rpm at the time but became known only much later through archival and reissue work, increasing its status as a collectors’ and historians’ item.[1][5][7]
- Discographical notes suggest that Oscar "Buddy" Woods, one of the most important early slide guitarists from the Texas–Louisiana region, probably plays on her records, linking her output directly to the classic Texas slide‑guitar tradition.[2][7][9]
- Modern researchers and collectors still describe Kitty Gray as an "obscure" artist, and even specialized blues and ragtime discographies have not uncovered firm biographical data such as her birthplace or dates of birth and death.[1][2][4]
