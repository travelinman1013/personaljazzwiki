## Biography
Louis 'Putney' Dandridge (January 13, 1902 – February 15, 1946) was an American jazz pianist, singer, and bandleader born in Richmond, Virginia. He began his career in 1918 as a pianist in the revue *The Drake and Walker Show*, touring regularly until 1926. By 1930, he served as accompanist to tap dancer Bill 'Bojangles' Robinson, including in the musical *Brown Buddies*, and appeared in the 1931 revue *Heatin' Up Harlem* starring Adelaide Hall at the Lafayette Theatre in Harlem. After touring the Great Lakes region, he settled in Cleveland, Ohio, in the early 1930s, leading his own band with guitarist Lonnie Johnson from 1932 to 1934.[2][1][4]

In 1934, Dandridge moved to New York City as a solo act, securing long residencies at venues like the Hickory House on 52nd Street and Adrian’s Taproom. His peak came from 1935 to 1936, when he recorded numerous vocal sides for Brunswick under his own name, backed by all-star jazz musicians in the swing style, including Roy Eldridge, Teddy Wilson, Henry 'Red' Allen, Buster Bailey, John Kirby, Chu Berry, and Cozy Cole. Known for his sophisticated piano playing and charismatic vocals, he blended stride piano influences with swing-era energy, though he struggled to compete with giants like Fats Waller and Louis Armstrong.[2][1][5]

Dandridge vanished from the music scene after 1936, possibly due to ill health, and died at age 44 in Wall Township, New Jersey. His recordings remain valued for capturing the vibrant swing era and showcasing top talent, contributing to his niche legacy in jazz history.[2][3]

## Fun Facts

- He held a solo piano spot at Adrian’s Taproom starting March 1935 before his New York residencies.[1]
- Despite acclaim, his recording career ended abruptly after 1936, unable to outcompete stars like Fats Waller, though his sides featured elite swing musicians.[1]
- Dandridge was a notable figure in Oslo's jazz scene in the 1950s according to some accounts, though primary sources focus on his U.S. career.[1]
