## Biography
Theodore Shaw 'Teddy' Wilson was born on November 24, 1912, in Austin, Texas, the son of James O. Wilson, a prominent teacher and librarian at Samuel Huston College, and Pearl Wilson, a librarian at Tuskegee Institute[1][4]. His parents, both educators, encouraged his early musical studies, and by age seven, Wilson was taking piano lessons; he later studied violin, E-flat clarinet, and oboe, playing in the school band at Tuskegee Institute after the family moved to Alabama in 1918[4][9]. Wilson briefly attended Talladega College as a music major before leaving to pursue a professional career, first in Detroit with Speed Webb’s band, then in Chicago, where he played with Erskine Tate, Louis Armstrong, and Jimmy Noone[1][4].

Wilson’s career breakthrough came in the mid-1930s when producer John Hammond brought him to New York, leading to collaborations with Benny Carter, Benny Goodman, and Gene Krupa[1][2]. He became an original member of the Benny Goodman Trio (later Quartet), one of the first racially integrated groups in popular music, and led a celebrated series of small-group recordings with Billie Holiday and Mildred Bailey[2][3]. Known for his elegant, restrained, and technically sophisticated piano style—often described as the 'definitive swing pianist'—Wilson was a major influence on the swing era and beyond[3][6]. He continued performing, recording, and teaching (including at Juilliard) until his death on July 31, 1986, in New Britain, Connecticut[1][2].

## Fun Facts
- Teddy Wilson was known for his impeccable professionalism—colleagues recalled he was never late and always impeccably dressed, standing apart from the wilder stereotypes of jazz musicians[5].
- He was the first African American musician to perform publicly with Benny Goodman's band, breaking racial barriers in the jazz world during the 1930s[3][4].
- Wilson was nicknamed the 'Marxist Mozart' by tap dancer and social activist Howard 'Stretch' Johnson due to his support for left-wing causes[6].
- In addition to performing, Wilson taught at the Juilliard School in the late 1940s and early 1950s and received an honorary doctorate from Berklee College of Music in 1979[1][6].
