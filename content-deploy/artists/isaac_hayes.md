## Biography
Isaac Hayes was born on August 20, 1942, in Covington, Tennessee, into extreme poverty as a sharecropping child. A self-taught pianist, saxophonist, and organist who sang in church choirs, he dropped out of school as a teen to perform in Memphis R&B groups and nightclubs, working odd jobs like in a slaughterhouse before recording his first album in 1962. By 1964, he joined Stax Records as a session musician and house band member, rising to prominence as a songwriter and producer partnering with David Porter on hits for Sam & Dave, such as 'Soul Man' and 'Hold On! I’m Comin’'.[1][2][3][4][5]
