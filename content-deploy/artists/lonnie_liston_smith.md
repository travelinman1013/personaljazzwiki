## Biography
Lonnie Liston Smith Jr., born December 28, 1940, in Richmond, Virginia, and raised in Baltimore, Maryland, began his musical journey immersed in gospel, blues, and jazz through his mother. He studied piano, tuba, and trumpet in high school and college, earning a B.S. in music education from Morgan State University in 1961. Influenced by Charlie Parker, John Coltrane, and Miles Davis, he gained local fame as a backing vocalist and pianist in the Baltimore area before moving to New York City in 1963, where he played with Betty Carter, Rahsaan Roland Kirk, Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers, Pharoah Sanders, Miles Davis, and Gato Barbieri.[1][3][4]

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Smith contributed to landmark albums like Pharoah Sanders' *Karma* (1969), *Jewels of Thought* (1970), and *Thembi* (1971), experimenting with electric keyboards and Fender Rhodes to blend spiritual free jazz with groove-oriented sounds. In 1973, he formed Lonnie Liston Smith and the Cosmic Echoes, releasing fusion classics such as *Astral Traveling* on Flying Dutchman Records, incorporating soul, funk, and atmospheric elements that became cornerstones of jazz fusion, smooth jazz, and acid jazz genres.[1][3][5]

Smith's later career returned to acoustic jazz roots with *Make Someone Happy* (1986) and continued with releases like *Love Goddess* (1990), maintaining his versatile style across decades. His work with the Cosmic Echoes solidified his legacy as a pioneer bridging experimental jazz with accessible funk grooves, influencing subsequent generations of keyboardists.[1][4]
