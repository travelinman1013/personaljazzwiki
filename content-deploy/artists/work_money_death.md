## Biography
Work Money Death is a contemporary jazz collective originating from Leeds, UK, known for their deeply spiritual and transcendental approach to improvised music. The group first gained attention as the backing ensemble for saxophonist Tony Burkill’s debut album on ATA Records in 2017, where their synergy and meditative style set them apart within the British jazz scene[1][4][5]. The ensemble features musicians from notable local acts such as The Sorcerers, The Lewis Express, and Nat Birchall’s band, bringing together a wealth of experience and creative energy from the Leeds music community[1].

Their 2021 album, 'The Space In Which The Uncontrollable Unknown Resides, Can Be The Space From Which Creation Arises,' was conceived and recorded during the COVID-19 lockdowns. The project was led by Burkill and bassist Neil Innes, who developed the music through extended improvisational sessions reminiscent of meditation practices. Each member recorded their parts separately, responding to previous performances in a continuous, evolving process. The result is a pair of long-form tracks, 'Dusk' and 'Dawn,' which evoke the spiritual jazz tradition of Pharoah Sanders and Alice Coltrane, blending powerful saxophone improvisations with mesmeric percussion and lush ensemble textures[1][2][5].

Work Money Death’s legacy lies in their commitment to collective improvisation and spiritual exploration, offering listeners a journey through meditative soundscapes and uplifting grooves. Their work has been praised for its emotional depth and ability to bring positivity during challenging times, cementing their reputation as innovators within the UK jazz underground[1].
