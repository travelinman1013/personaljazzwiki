## Biography
Louis York is an American musical duo formed in 2015 by Claude Kelly and Chuck Harmony, two multi-Grammy nominated songwriters and producers who decided to transition from behind-the-scenes work to creating their own artistic vision. Kelly and Harmony first met while collaborating on Chrisette Michele's 2009 album Epiphany, and over the following years, they established themselves as sought-after producers and songwriters for major artists including Rihanna, Bruno Mars, Britney Spears, Mary J. Blige, Kelly Clarkson, Jessie J, Miley Cyrus, Michael Jackson, Janet Jackson, Whitney Houston, and Celine Dion. Wanting to move beyond being songwriters for hire and to better reflect their own artistic perspective, they formed Louis York, naming the band after a combination of their respective hometowns—Kelly from New York City and Harmony from East St. Louis.

Louis York's musical style is deliberately genre-defying, drawing from diverse influences including their backgrounds in church choirs, R&B, jazz, and the Motown sound. They describe their music as "world music" in its multi-genre and international sensibilities. The duo released an EP trilogy titled Masterpiece Theater (Acts I, II, and III) between 2015 and 2017, which earned critical praise from publications including Billboard and the Los Angeles Times for their genre-bending approach. Their 2019 debut album American Griots marked a significant milestone, with lead singles "Don't You Forget" and "How Will I Feel" reaching the top 15 on the US Urban Radio chart. The album's title references West African griots—storytellers and oral historians—with the addition of "American" to modernize and personalize this role, reflecting how Louis York views themselves as contemporary storytellers and performers.

Beyond their own music, Louis York established Weirdo Workshop, a creative studio and label based in Franklin, Tennessee, that serves as a multi-purpose creative hub for producing music, hosting lectures, book clubs, and live performances. The duo has amassed millions of cumulative streams on Spotify, performed sold-out shows domestically and internationally, appeared on major media outlets including the 3rd Hour Today, PBS NewsHour, and CNN, and performed multiple times at the Grand Ole Opry. In 2024, they won the Jazz Category of the American Songwriter Song Contest. Their upcoming sophomore album Songs with Friends is set to feature collaborations with artists including Gramps Morgan, PJ Morton, Jessie J, Lalah Hathaway, Chris Daughtry, and Anthony Hamilton.
