## Biography
Ethel Waters (October 31, 1896 – September 1, 1977) was a pioneering American singer and actress whose career spanned the genres of blues, jazz, swing, and popular music. Born in extreme poverty in Chester, Pennsylvania, Waters endured a difficult childhood, marrying at age 12 and working as a chambermaid before launching her singing career as a teenager in Baltimore, where she performed under the moniker 'Sweet Mama Stringbean.' Her early breakthrough came when she became the first woman to sing W.C. Handy's 'St. Louis Blues' on stage, quickly establishing herself as a star on the vaudeville circuit and Harlem Renaissance scene.[1][2][3][4][5]

Waters' artistry was marked by her expressive, full-bodied voice, precise diction, and emotional depth, which allowed her to move seamlessly from classic blues to jazz, ballads, and Broadway show tunes. She recorded major hits such as 'Dinah,' 'Stormy Weather,' 'Am I Blue?,' and 'His Eye Is on the Sparrow,' and became the first Black woman to receive equal billing with white stars on Broadway. Her acting career was equally groundbreaking: she starred in the Broadway musical 'As Thousands Cheer,' the film 'Cabin in the Sky,' and was the second African American to be nominated for an Academy Award (for 'Pinky,' 1949). Waters also broke barriers as the first African American to star in her own television show and the first Black woman nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award.[2][3][4][5]

Beyond her artistic achievements, Waters was a trailblazer for civil rights in entertainment, advocating for actors' rights and serving on the executive council of Actors Equity and the Negro Actors Guild of America. Her legacy endures as one of the most versatile and influential performers of the 20th century, inspiring generations of artists across genres and breaking racial barriers in American entertainment.[3][4][6]
