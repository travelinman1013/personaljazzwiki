## Biography
Carmela Rappazzo is an American jazz vocalist and composer known for her evocative interpretations and original songwriting. Born and raised in upstate New York, she grew up surrounded by music, as her father and several of his siblings were big band swing musicians. This early exposure to jazz and the Great American Songbook deeply influenced her musical sensibilities and set the foundation for her artistic journey[1][5].

Rappazzo began her professional career at age 19, performing with an old-school jazz orchestra and appearing at notable New York venues such as The Bushes and Ruskay's on the Upper West Side[6]. Over the years, she developed a distinctive style that blends classic jazz vocals with contemporary songwriting, often drawing inspiration from personal experiences and literary sources. Her discography includes seven albums, with her latest project, "Love and Other Difficulties," written and recorded during the COVID-19 lockdown in New Orleans, showcasing her continued evolution as an artist[4].

Now based in New Orleans, Rappazzo collaborates with prominent local musicians and remains active in the jazz scene, contributing to the city's rich musical tapestry. Her work is characterized by a strong melodic sensibility, lyrical depth, and a commitment to both honoring tradition and exploring new creative territories[2].
