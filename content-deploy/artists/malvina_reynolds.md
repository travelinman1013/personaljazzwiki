## Biography
Malvina Reynolds (born Malvina Milder on August 23, 1900, in San Francisco, California) was an American folk singer-songwriter and political activist who began her musical career late in life after a diverse background in academia, social work, and manual labor. She earned a doctorate in 1939 but faced employment barriers due to the Great Depression, her Jewish heritage, socialist views, and gender, leading her to work as a social worker, columnist for People's World, assembly-line worker in a bomb factory during World War II, and co-manager of her family's naval tailor shop in Long Beach, California, following her father's death in 1944. In her late 40s, amid the post-WWII folk revival, she connected with the folk music scene in Long Beach, taking guitar lessons and writing songs inspired by social issues.[1][2][3]

## Fun Facts
- While driving through Daly City in 1962, Reynolds spontaneously wrote 'Little Boxes' on the way to a gig, asking her husband to take the wheel so she could compose it.
- She appeared on Sesame Street as a folk singer named 'Kate,' winning over skeptical producers with her storytelling in just 10 minutes.
- Reynolds wrote 'Battle of Maxton Field' in 1958 the same day Lumbee Indians ran off the Ku Klux Klan at a rally in North Carolina, performing it that night.
- Her first guitar was a makeshift 'big old F-hole orange crate with a crack in the back,' which she credited with sparking her songwriting.
