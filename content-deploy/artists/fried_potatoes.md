## Biography
There is no verified musical artist known as 'Fried Potatoes.' The closest relevant entity is the American indie rock band Papas Fritas, whose name translates to 'fried potatoes' in Spanish. Papas Fritas formed in 1992 at Tufts University in Somerville, Massachusetts, where founding members Tony Goddess, Shivika Asthana, and Keith Gendel began playing together. Initially performing for fun and releasing cassette-only recordings, they gained traction after their single 'Friday Night' led to a US tour and a deal with Minty Fresh Records. Their debut album was released in 1995, followed by extensive touring with acts like the Flaming Lips and the Cardigans.

Papas Fritas became known for their melodic indie pop sound, blending catchy hooks with thoughtful lyrics and a playful, DIY spirit. They released three studio albums—'Papas Fritas' (1995), 'Helioself' (1997), and 'Buildings and Grounds' (2000)—before disbanding in 2000. The band briefly reunited in 2011 for festival appearances in Europe and the US, and their legacy endures as a cult favorite among indie pop enthusiasts.
