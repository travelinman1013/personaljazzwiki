## Biography
Edward James "Son" House Jr. (1902–1988) was born near Lyon, Mississippi, into a family with musical roots but was initially drawn to the church, becoming a preacher and pastor in his teens. His early years were marked by a strong devotion to gospel music and a rejection of secular blues, a tension that would define much of his life[2][3][1]. Around age 25, House was inspired by local slide guitarists and the expressive power of blues, leading him to embrace the genre and develop a unique style that fused the emotional intensity of his preaching with raw, rhythmic guitar work[2][4].

House's career began in the Mississippi Delta, where he performed at local gatherings and juke joints, often alongside blues luminaries like Charley Patton and Willie Brown. In 1930, he recorded for Paramount Records, but these early recordings saw little commercial success due to the Great Depression[2][5]. Despite this, House became a significant influence on future legends such as Robert Johnson and Muddy Waters, shaping the sound and spirit of Delta blues[1][2][5]. After a period of incarceration and subsequent exile from Clarksdale, he continued performing locally before moving north during the Great Migration, eventually settling in Rochester, New York, where he worked outside of music for many years[5].

Son House was rediscovered during the 1960s folk and blues revival, thanks to the efforts of younger musicians and researchers. He returned to performing, captivating new audiences with his passionate, trance-like performances and powerful slide guitar. His legacy endures as one of the foundational figures in blues, revered for his emotional depth, innovative technique, and profound influence on generations of musicians[2][5][1].
