## Biography
Jimmy Reed, born Mathis James Reed on September 6, 1925, in Dunleith, Mississippi, was one of the most influential American blues musicians of the post-World War II era. Raised in a sharecropping family, he learned guitar and harmonica as a child, often playing with his lifelong friend and mentor Eddie Taylor. After serving in the U.S. Navy and working in Chicago’s steel mills and meatpacking plants, Reed began performing on street corners and in clubs, eventually signing with Vee-Jay Records in 1953. His breakthrough came with the hit 'You Don’t Have to Go' in 1955, launching a string of chart-topping singles that included 'Baby, What You Want Me to Do,' 'Big Boss Man,' and 'Bright Lights, Big City.' Reed’s music was characterized by its simple, repetitive lyrics, smooth vocals, and a signature 'walking blues' style, often featuring his harmonica played with a wire rack around his neck. His songs resonated with both black and white audiences, making him one of the first blues artists to achieve crossover success and helping to bridge cultural divides during the civil rights era.

Despite struggles with epilepsy and alcoholism, Reed remained a popular performer and recording artist through the 1960s and into the 1970s. He was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1980 and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1991. Reed’s legacy endures not only through his own recordings but also through the countless artists he inspired across genres. His music, marked by its accessibility and emotional honesty, continues to influence new generations of musicians and listeners.
