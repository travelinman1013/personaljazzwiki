## Biography
Stan Kenton (born Stanley Newcomb Kenton, December 15, 1911, Wichita, Kansas – August 25, 1979, Los Angeles, California) was a pioneering American jazz pianist, composer, arranger, and bandleader. Raised in Colorado and later California, Kenton began piano lessons in his teens and was introduced to jazz by pianist and arranger Ralph Yaw, who exposed him to the music of Louis Armstrong and Earl Hines. By 16, Kenton was already performing locally, and after high school, he toured with various bands throughout the 1930s before forming his own orchestra in 1941[1][4][7].

Kenton’s orchestra quickly became one of the most influential big bands of the 1940s and 1950s, known for its bold, brassy sound, complex arrangements, and willingness to experiment with form and orchestration. He was instrumental in moving jazz from dance halls to concert halls, often incorporating elements of modern classical music and Afro-Cuban rhythms into his work. Kenton’s ensembles featured many future jazz stars, and he was a champion of young arranger-composers, commissioning challenging works that pushed the boundaries of big band jazz. His music, sometimes controversial for its volume and complexity, played a key role in the Third Stream movement, blending jazz and classical traditions[1][4][6][7].

Beyond performance, Kenton was a major force in jazz education, founding the Stan Kenton Jazz Camp in 1959 and inspiring generations of musicians through his clinics and workshops. His legacy endures in the continued performance of his arrangements, the ongoing influence of his educational initiatives, and the impact he had on the evolution of big band jazz[1][6].
