## Biography
Yussef Dayes, born on December 12, 1992, in South East London, is an English jazz drummer, composer, and record producer known for his innovative contributions to modern jazz. Introduced to music at an early age, he received his first drum kit at four from his Jamaican bass-playing father, while his mother exposed him to country and '60s pop music. This diverse musical environment, combined with his father's reggae and jazz vinyl collection, deeply influenced his rhythmic sensibility. At age ten, Dayes began formal study under legendary fusion drummer Billy Cobham, which cemented his pursuit of professional musicianship. He grew up immersed in the South London jazz scene, playing with his brothers in the Afrobeat-jazz fusion band United Vibrations, which gained acclaim for blending Afrobeat with jazz and rock elements.
