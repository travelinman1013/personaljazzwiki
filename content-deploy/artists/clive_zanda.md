## Biography
Clive 'Zanda' Alexander (1939–2022) was a pioneering Trinidadian pianist, composer, and architect, widely celebrated as the father of kaiso jazz—a genre that fuses the improvisational language of jazz with the rhythmic and melodic structures of Trinidadian calypso. Born in the countryside of Trinidad, Zanda began piano lessons with a relative but initially pursued architecture, believing music was not a viable career path in the Caribbean. At age 20, he moved to England to study architecture, but his passion for music persisted, leading him to immerse himself in the vibrant London jazz scene and take private lessons with British composer Michael Grant. He formed the Dez Alex Combo, performing at prestigious venues such as the Pigalle Club and the Royal Festival Hall, and began experimenting with blending calypso and jazz, laying the groundwork for his later innovations.[1][2][4]

Returning to Trinidad in the late 1960s, Zanda became a central figure in the local music scene, collaborating with educator and jazz enthusiast Scofield Pilgrim at Queen's Royal College to formalize the fusion of calypso and jazz. Together, they established workshops and ensembles that nurtured a new generation of musicians and solidified kaiso jazz as a distinct genre. Zanda's landmark album, 'Clive Zanda Is Here! With Dat Kinda Ting Calypsojazz Innovations,' showcased his sophisticated approach to trio playing and improvisation, influencing the evolution of Caribbean jazz for decades. He continued to perform, teach, and document his compositions, ensuring his legacy would endure both in Trinidad and internationally.[1][2][3][5]

Zanda's musical style was characterized by the integration of calypso's simple harmonies with jazz's complex chords and improvisational techniques. He was instrumental in promoting the steelpan as a jazz instrument and played a leading role in the development of pan jazz festivals in Trinidad. His commitment to education and documentation inspired countless musicians, and his work remains foundational to the Caribbean jazz tradition.[3][6]
