## Biography
Greg Brown, born in 1949 in the Hacklebarney region of Iowa, was raised in a musical family: his mother played electric guitar, his grandfather played banjo, and his father was a preacher, immersing him in gospel and Appalachian folk traditions from an early age. Brown began performing professionally at 18, running hootenannies at the legendary Gerdes Folk City in New York City, where he was quickly absorbed into the Greenwich Village folk scene. After early stints in Los Angeles and Las Vegas, including ghostwriting for Buck Ram of the Platters, Brown returned to Iowa, where he began writing songs and performing in local clubs and coffeehouses[1][2][3][5][6].

Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Brown developed a distinctive style blending Americana, folk, and alt-country, characterized by his gravelly baritone, poetic lyrics, and homespun guitar work. His career took a significant turn when he became a regular guest on Garrison Keillor’s 'A Prairie Home Companion,' which brought his music to a national audience. In 1986, he co-founded Red House Records with Bob Feldman, providing him with creative freedom and helping launch a vital independent folk label. Brown released over 30 albums, collaborating closely with producer and guitarist Bo Ramsey, and his songs were covered by artists such as Willie Nelson, Carlos Santana, Shawn Colvin, and Mary Chapin Carpenter[1][2][3][4][7].

Brown’s legacy is that of a quintessential Midwestern songwriter whose work captures the spirit and struggles of rural America. His influence extends through his recordings, collaborations, and the many artists who cite him as an inspiration. Even after his soft retirement in 2019, Brown continues to write and occasionally perform, and his 2024 retrospective songbook, 'Ring Around the Moon,' cements his status as a folk icon[4][7].
