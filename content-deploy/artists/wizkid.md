## Biography
Ayodeji Ibrahim Balogun, known professionally as Wizkid, was born on July 16, 1990, in Surulere, Lagos, Nigeria. Growing up in a large interfaith household with twelve siblings, Wizkid was exposed to a rich musical environment, drawing inspiration from legends like Fela Kuti, Bob Marley, and King Sunny Ade. He began singing at the age of 11, initially performing under the stage name 'Li’l Prince' and later forming a group called the Glorious Five with church friends. Despite initial resistance from his family, Wizkid’s passion for music led him to pursue his craft relentlessly, eventually signing with Empire Mates Entertainment in 2009. His debut album, 'Superstar' (2011), marked his breakthrough, featuring hits like 'Holla at Your Boy' and earning him the Headies’ 'Next Rated Award.'

Wizkid’s musical style blends afrobeats, afrobeat, afropop, azonto, afroswing, afro R&B, and afropiano, making him a defining figure in the global rise of African pop music. His collaborations with international stars such as Drake, Beyoncé, and Major Lazer have brought afrobeats to mainstream audiences worldwide. Albums like 'Made in Lagos' and singles such as 'Essence' and 'Brown Skin Girl' have cemented his legacy as a pioneer of contemporary African music, earning him multiple awards and accolades, including a Grammy for Best Music Video.

Wizkid’s journey from a determined teenager sleeping outside recording studios to a global superstar reflects his perseverance and talent. He is recognized as the first African musician to score seven Billboard nominations, the youngest African to receive a Grammy nomination, and the first Nigerian to win three Billboard Music Awards. His influence extends beyond music, shaping the sound and direction of a new generation of African artists.
