## Biography
Elvin Bishop, born October 21, 1942, in Glendale, California, grew up on a farm in Iowa before moving to Oklahoma at age ten. His early exposure to blues came from late-night radio, which inspired him to pursue music. Winning a National Merit Scholarship, Bishop attended the University of Chicago, immersing himself in the vibrant Chicago blues scene and meeting harmonica player Paul Butterfield. Together, they formed the Paul Butterfield Blues Band in 1963, a group that became pivotal in introducing electric Chicago blues to rock audiences and was later inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.

After five years and four albums with the Butterfield Blues Band, Bishop moved to San Francisco in 1968, where he formed the Elvin Bishop Group and became a fixture at the Fillmore Auditorium, jamming with legends like Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, and B.B. King. His solo career flourished in the 1970s, highlighted by the hit "Fooled Around and Fell in Love" from the album 'Struttin’ My Stuff' (1975). Bishop is celebrated for his unique slide guitar style, blending blues, rock, gospel, R&B, and country influences, and for his sense of humor and storytelling in his music. Over decades, he has remained a respected figure in American roots music, earning multiple Grammy nominations and continuing to perform and record into the 21st century.
