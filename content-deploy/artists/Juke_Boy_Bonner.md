## Biography
Weldon H. Philip Bonner, known as Juke Boy Bonner, was born on March 22, 1932, in Bellville, Texas, USA, and became a distinctive voice in Texas blues as a singer, guitarist, harmonica player, and one-man band[2][6][7]. Orphaned at a young age, he was raised by neighbors and later lived with his older sister, teaching himself guitar by age twelve and earning his nickname by performing in local juke joints[2][6][7]. His early career breakthrough came in 1948 when he won a Houston talent contest, leading to a radio spot and local recognition[6][7]. Bonner’s music was deeply rooted in the experiences of Black urban life, often addressing hardship and resilience in songs like 'Life is a Nightmare' and 'Struggle Here in Houston'[2]. He was notable for performing as a one-man band, accompanying himself on guitar, harmonica, and sometimes drums or cymbals, a style inspired by pioneers like Joe Hill Louis and Dr. Ross[2][4]. After health struggles in the early 1960s, including major stomach surgery, Bonner turned to poetry, publishing in the Houston Forward Times and setting his verses to music, which expanded his lyrical depth and appeal[6]. He recorded for labels such as Irma, Goldband, and Arhoolie, with albums like 'I'm Going Back to the Country' and 'The Struggle' cementing his reputation[4][6]. Bonner toured Europe in 1969 and performed at major festivals, but his career was cut short by his death from cirrhosis in 1978 at age 46[4][6]. Despite limited commercial success, his raw, poetic blues and DIY ethos left a lasting mark on the genre.
