## Biography
J Balvin, born José Álvaro Osorio Balvin on May 7, 1985, in Medellín, Colombia, is a pioneering reggaeton artist who has become one of the most influential figures in Latin music. Growing up, he was inspired by rock bands like Nirvana and Metallica, but his musical direction shifted after being captivated by the reggaeton wave led by Daddy Yankee. At 17, Balvin moved to the United States, living in Oklahoma and New York to learn English and immerse himself in diverse musical cultures, working various jobs before returning to Colombia to pursue his music career in earnest[1][3][5].

Balvin's rise began with local club performances in Medellín and collaborations with Infinity Music producers. His breakthrough came in 2014 with the single "6 AM" featuring Farruko, which peaked at number 2 on the Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart and propelled his album "La Familia" to international success. Subsequent albums like "Energia" (2016), "Vibras" (2018), and high-profile collaborations with artists such as Beyoncé, Cardi B, and Bad Bunny solidified his global appeal. Notably, "Mi Gente" and its remix with Beyoncé topped charts worldwide, and his work with Bad Bunny on "Oasis" further expanded his influence[2][3][4].

J Balvin's musical style blends reggaeton, dancehall, hip-hop, and R&B, characterized by infectious rhythms and a commitment to making Latin music accessible to global audiences. He has won multiple Latin Grammy Awards, Billboard Latin Music Awards, and set streaming records, including being Spotify's most-streamed artist in 2018. Balvin's legacy lies in his role as a cultural ambassador, breaking language barriers and inspiring a new generation of Latin artists to dream big and embrace their roots[1][2][6].
