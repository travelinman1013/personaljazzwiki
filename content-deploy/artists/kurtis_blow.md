## Biography
Kurtis Blow, born Kurtis Walker on August 9, 1959, in Harlem, New York, began his musical journey as a DJ in grade school, taking requests at his mother's parties, and by age 13 was sneaking into New York City clubs with a fake ID to study top DJs. He started spinning tracks as Kool DJ Kurt while in high school, enrolling at Harlem's High School of Music and Art in 1975 but facing expulsion for drug sales before earning his GED and attending City College. Disillusioned with repetitive club music by the late 1970s, Blow innovated by mixing rhymes over beats, helping pioneer rap as a unique genre that drew crowds.[1][2][3]

In 1979, at age 20, Blow became the first rapper signed to a major label, Mercury Records, releasing 'Christmas Rappin'' which sold over 400,000 copies and became an annual classic, followed by the gold-certified 'The Breaks' from his self-titled debut album, the first gold rap single. Over the next 11 years, he released 10 albums including Deuce, Party Time (fusing rap and go-go), Ego Trip (with hits like '8 Million Stories,' 'AJ Scratch,' and 'Basketball'), and America (featuring 'If I Ruled the World,' a Top 5 Billboard hit). His style blended old school hip hop with east coast flair, social commentary, and charisma, producing hits for others and appearing in Sprite ads as the first hip-hop artist in mainstream advertising.[1][2][3][4][5]

In 2009, Blow became an ordained minister and founded Hip Hop Ministry (also called Hip Hop Church) in Harlem, incorporating rap into worship while continuing to speak against racism and drugs; he coordinated 'King Holiday' tributing Martin Luther King Jr. His legacy as a foundational figure endures, with 'The Breaks' and 'If I Ruled the World' (later sampled by Nas to double platinum success) cementing his role in commercializing hip hop.[1][2][3]
