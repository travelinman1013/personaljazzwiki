## Biography
Chet Baker, born Chesney Henry Baker Jr. on December 23, 1929, in Yale, Oklahoma, emerged as one of the most distinctive voices in jazz, both as a trumpeter and vocalist. Raised in a musical family, he moved to California in 1940, where he began playing trumpet at age eleven. Baker’s early exposure to jazz came during his service in U.S. Army bands from 1946 to 1948 and again from 1950 to 1952, experiences that shaped his understated, lyrical style.

Baker’s rise to prominence began in the early 1950s, performing with notable musicians such as Stan Getz and Charlie Parker. In 1952, he joined Gerry Mulligan’s innovative pianoless quartet, where his cool, melodic trumpet lines and intuitive interplay with Mulligan helped define the West Coast jazz sound. Baker’s fame soared with the release of 'Chet Baker Sings' in 1954, which showcased his intimate, almost fragile vocal delivery alongside his trumpet work. Despite his musical success, Baker’s career was marred by struggles with drug addiction, leading to periods of incarceration and instability. Nevertheless, he remained a sought-after artist, particularly in Europe, and continued to record and perform until his death in Amsterdam on May 13, 1988.

Baker’s legacy endures as a central figure in cool jazz, celebrated for his lyrical improvisation, haunting vocals, and the emotional depth he brought to both trumpet and voice. His influence resonates in subsequent generations of jazz musicians, and his life story has inspired numerous biographies and documentaries, including the acclaimed film 'Let’s Get Lost.'
