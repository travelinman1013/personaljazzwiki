## Biography
The Louvin Brothers, brothers Ira Loudermilk (born April 21, 1924, in Henegar, Alabama) and Charlie Loudermilk (born July 7, 1927, in Section, Alabama), grew up in rural Appalachian poverty, immersed in shape note gospel music that shaped their signature close-harmony style blending country, bluegrass, and gospel. They began performing together in 1942 on Chattanooga radio station WDEF while Ira worked in a mill, adopting the stage name 'Louvin Brothers' around 1946 for better marketability after early monikers like Sand Mountain Playboys. Ira played mandolin and sang high tenor lead, while Charlie played guitar and provided lower harmony vocals; they recorded their first single 'Alabama' for Apollo Records in 1947 while in Memphis, followed by brief stints with Decca and MGM Records.[1][2][3][4]

## Fun Facts

- They briefly formed a full bluegrass band in 1951 with banjo, fiddle, and bass but disbanded without recording due to poor reception.
- Capitol's Ken Nelson bluffed Grand Ole Opry manager Jack Stapp into hiring them in 1955 by claiming rival Ozark Jubilee was about to sign them.
- Their cousin John D. Loudermilk kept the family name Loudermilk while they adopted 'Louvin' for stage use.
