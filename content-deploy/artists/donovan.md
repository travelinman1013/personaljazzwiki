## Biography
Donovan Phillips Leitch, born May 10, 1946, in Glasgow, Scotland, is a seminal figure in 1960s folk and psychedelic music. Raised in a musically inclined family, he was exposed early to traditional Scottish and Irish songs, which shaped his eclectic style. After moving to Hatfield, England, Donovan began playing guitar at 14 and briefly attended art school before pursuing music full-time, inspired by the beatnik lifestyle and the burgeoning British folk scene.

Donovan's career took off in the mid-1960s with the release of 'Catch the Wind,' a folk single that drew comparisons to Bob Dylan. He quickly evolved, embracing psychedelic and jazz influences, and became a defining voice of the flower power era with hits like 'Sunshine Superman,' 'Mellow Yellow,' and 'Hurdy Gurdy Man.' His music blended folk, pop, jazz, and Eastern sounds, often featuring whimsical lyrics and innovative arrangements. Donovan maintained commercial success throughout the late 1960s, collaborating with top producers and musicians, and later continued to record and perform sporadically into the 21st century.

Donovan's legacy is marked by his induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012 and the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2014. His influence endures through his genre-blending style and his role in shaping the psychedelic pop movement, inspiring generations of musicians and songwriters.
