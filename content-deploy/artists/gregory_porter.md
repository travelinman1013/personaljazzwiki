## Biography
Gregory Porter is an acclaimed American jazz vocalist and songwriter, born on November 4, 1971, in Sacramento, California, and raised in Bakersfield. Growing up, he was deeply influenced by his mother, Ruth Porter, an evangelist, and her collection of Nat King Cole records, which would later become a cornerstone of his musical style. Porter initially pursued a football scholarship at San Diego State University, but a shoulder injury ended his athletic career, prompting him to focus on music. He began singing in small jazz clubs in San Diego while still a student, gradually developing his craft and voice.

After moving to Brooklyn, New York, with his brother Lloyd, Porter worked as a chef at his brother’s café and performed at local venues, including Harlem’s St. Nick’s Pub. His breakthrough came with his debut album 'Water' (2010), which earned a Grammy nomination, followed by 'Be Good' (2012). His major commercial and critical success arrived with 'Liquid Spirit' (2013), his Blue Note debut, which won the Grammy for Best Jazz Vocal Album and sold over a million copies worldwide. Porter’s subsequent albums, including 'Take Me to the Alley' (2016, Grammy winner), 'Nat King Cole & Me' (2017), and 'All Rise' (2020), have cemented his reputation as one of the most soulful and influential jazz singers of his generation.

Porter’s music blends jazz, gospel, soul, and blues, characterized by his rich baritone and heartfelt lyricism. He is recognized for his ability to bridge traditional jazz with contemporary themes, drawing from personal experiences and social commentary. His legacy is marked by his distinctive voice, his signature cap, and his role in revitalizing vocal jazz for new audiences.
