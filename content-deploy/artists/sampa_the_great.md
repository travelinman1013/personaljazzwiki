## Biography
Sampa The Great, born Sampa Tembo in 1993 in Ndola, Zambia, is a critically acclaimed rapper and producer whose career has been shaped by her transcontinental journey across Africa, North America, and Australia.[1][2] Born in the Copperbelt province, she moved to Gaborone, Botswana at age one when her father, an insurance broker, relocated the family to escape Zambia's economic turmoil. Her early passion for performance manifested in childhood through theatrical productions and singing, encouraged by her mother's enthusiastic support.[1] Despite her parents' initial hopes that she would pursue engineering or diplomacy, Sampa's artistic calling proved irresistible, leading her to study music for visual media at the Academy of Art University in San Francisco in 2010, followed by audio engineering studies at SAE Creative Media Institute in Australia.[1][2]

Sampa's professional music career gained momentum after she relocated to Melbourne in 2016, establishing herself as a distinctive voice in contemporary hip-hop through projects including *The Great Mixtape*, the *HERoes* EP series, and her acclaimed 2019 debut album *The Return*.[2][4] The album became a watershed moment in her career, earning her three ARIA Awards, the Australian Music Prize (making her the first artist to win it twice), recognition from Michelle Obama, and international radio support from tastemakers including Zane Lowe, Ebro Darden, and Annie Mac.[4] However, the turning point in her artistic identity came in early 2020 when the pandemic prompted her return to Zambia, where she reconnected with her roots and resolved the internal conflict between her personal identity as Sampa Tembo and her artistic persona.[1][2] This homecoming fundamentally transformed her work, resulting in the album *As Above, So Below*, which celebrates Zambian music and culture with newfound confidence and authenticity.[1]

Sampa's artistic legacy centers on themes of cultural pride, womanhood, and self-determination, particularly as an African woman navigating male-dominated spaces in hip-hop and music production.[2][3] Her work is characterized by expert songwriting, socially conscious lyricism, and a commitment to representing herself authentically rather than conforming to external expectations of what a female rapper should be.[1][3] Currently based on her parents' farm in Lusaka, Zambia, she continues to create music that bridges her Southern African heritage with contemporary global hip-hop, establishing herself as a crucial voice in contemporary African music.

## Fun Facts
- Sampa discovered that her cousin was a member of Witch, one of Zambia's foundational bands, a revelation that deepened her connection to her family's musical legacy and inspired her to embrace music as a career path.[1]
- She was the only woman and only African woman in her music for visual media class at the Academy of Art University in San Francisco, an experience that shaped her perspective on representation and identity in creative industries.[1]
- Sampa is the first artist ever to win the Australian Music Prize twice in their career, achieving this distinction with her debut album *The Return* in 2019.[4]
- Her father initially believed music was not a viable career in Zambia, but after learning about her cousin's involvement with Witch and hearing about the musical heritage in their family lineage, he became affirming of her artistic path, telling her 'You're doing the right thing, you know that music is in your blood.'[3]
