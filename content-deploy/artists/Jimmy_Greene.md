## Biography
James Sidney Greene, Jr. was born on February 24, 1975, in Hartford, Connecticut, to James Sr., a saxophonist, and Renee Simmons. Growing up in a musically inclined family with three siblings, Greene received his first alto saxophone at the age of six and began formal lessons by age eight. His passion for jazz flourished during his middle school years, leading him to graduate with honors from Bloomfield High School in 1993. He continued his studies at The Hartt School, graduating summa cum laude in 1997, the same year he launched his professional music career[1].

Greene's recording career began in 1997, and he has since released eight studio albums. His debut, Brand New World, appeared in 2000, followed by a series of releases on labels such as Criss Cross Records, Nu Jazz Records, Sunnyside Records, and Mack Avenue Records. His eighth album, Beautiful Life, released in 2014, marked his commercial breakthrough, charting on multiple Billboard lists and earning Grammy Award nominations, including Best Jazz Instrumental Album and Best Arrangement, Instrumental and Vocals (with Javier Colon for "When I Come Home," for which Greene was the sole arranger). In addition to his recording work, Greene is a music professor at Western Connecticut State University and previously taught at the University of Manitoba. He is also active in his local church's music ministry and resides in Sandy Hook, Connecticut, with his wife, flautist Nelba Márquez[1].

Greene's musical style encompasses jazz, gospel, post-bop, and neo-bop, reflecting both his technical mastery and deep spiritual roots. His work, particularly the album Beautiful Life, stands as a tribute to his daughter Ana Grace Márquez-Greene, who was tragically killed in the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. Greene's legacy is marked by his contributions as a performer, educator, and arranger, as well as his ability to channel personal tragedy into powerful, emotionally resonant music that continues to influence the jazz and gospel genres[1].
