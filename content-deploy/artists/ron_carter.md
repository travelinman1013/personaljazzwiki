## Biography
Ronald Levin Carter (born May 4, 1937, in Ferndale, Michigan) is an American jazz double bassist and cellist widely regarded as one of the most original and influential bassists in jazz history.[1][4] He began on cello around age 10–12, but after his family moved to the Detroit area and he encountered racial stereotyping in classical settings, he switched to double bass while at Cass Technical High School, quickly distinguishing himself in Detroit’s strong music education system.[2][3][5] Carter studied at the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, New York, earning a bachelor’s degree in 1959, then relocated to New York City and completed a master’s degree in double bass at the Manhattan School of Music in 1961.[2][3][4] During this period he moved from classical training into jazz, freelancing with Chico Hamilton, Eric Dolphy, Randy Weston, Bobby Timmons, Cannonball Adderley, Thelonious Monk, and Art Farmer, and making early landmark recordings such as Dolphy’s “Out There” and his own early leader album “Where?”, where he played cello in innovative low-register textures.[1][2][3]

Carter’s international profile rose dramatically when he joined Miles Davis in 1963 as the bassist in Davis’s so‑called Second Great Quintet with Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter, and Tony Williams.[1][2][3] He remained with Davis until 1968, appearing on pivotal mid‑1960s albums including “Seven Steps to Heaven” and “E.S.P.” and contributing compositions such as “R.J.,” “Mood,” and “Eighty‑One,” helping to reshape small‑group jazz rhythm sections with a more fluid, interactive, and harmonically exploratory approach.[1][3] After leaving Davis, Carter became one of the most in‑demand studio and freelance bassists of the 1970s and beyond, working not only with jazz greats like Sonny Rollins, McCoy Tyner, Bill Evans, Dexter Gordon, Wes Montgomery, and Lena Horne, but also with artists from other genres including Roberta Flack, Billy Joel, Paul Simon, Bette Midler, Aretha Franklin, and the hip‑hop group A Tribe Called Quest (on their influential album “The Low End Theory”).[1][3][4] As a bandleader from the early 1970s onward he has led a variety of ensembles—trios, quartets, nonets, and a big band—and experimented with instrumentation, including his own piccolo bass, while also writing for string quartets and bass ensembles.[2][3][4]

Stylistically, Carter is noted for his impeccable time, resonant tone, sophisticated harmonic sense, and the way he uses walking lines, countermelodies, and chord substitutions to shape the direction of a band in real time.[3][4][7] He has been a pioneering jazz cellist and one of the first to feature piccolo bass in jazz contexts, expanding the role of low‑string instruments beyond traditional accompaniment.[3] Over a career spanning more than six decades, he has appeared on an unprecedented number of recording sessions—recognized by Guinness World Records as over 2,200 recordings—making him the most recorded jazz bassist in history, and he has received multiple Grammy Awards, including one for his composition “Call Sheet Blues” from the film “Round Midnight,” another as part of the Miles Davis Tribute Band, and a 2022 Grammy for Best Jazz Instrumental Album for “Skyline.”[1][4] Alongside his performing and recording, Carter has been a respected educator and author of instructional books, mentoring generations of bassists and earning major honors such as the NEA Jazz Masters recognition, the Eastman School’s Hutchinson Award, and the Satchmo Award from the Louis Armstrong Foundation, cementing his legacy as both a master performer and a central figure in the transmission of jazz tradition.[3][4]

## Fun Facts
- Carter holds a Guinness World Record as the **most recorded jazz bassist in history**, with 2,221 credited recordings as of 2015—since then he has added hundreds more sessions.[1][4]
- He began his musical life as a **cellist** and only switched to bass in high school due in part to racial stereotyping and opportunity issues he faced as a Black classical string player on cello.[2][3][5]
- Carter not only plays standard double bass and cello but also **invented and popularized his own piccolo bass**, a smaller, higher‑pitched bass that he has used in several of his groups.[2][3]
- Beyond jazz, he has appeared on a broad range of projects, from Billy Joel’s song **“Big Man on Mulberry Street”** to the hip‑hop classic **“The Low End Theory”** by A Tribe Called Quest, demonstrating unusual stylistic reach for an acoustic bassist.[1][2][4]
