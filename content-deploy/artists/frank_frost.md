## Biography
Frank Frost was a renowned American blues harmonica player, singer, and songwriter, born on April 15, 1936, in Auvergne, Arkansas. Growing up in the Mississippi Delta, Frost was immersed in the region’s rich musical traditions, which shaped his early interest in blues. He began his professional career in the 1950s, initially playing guitar before switching to harmonica, the instrument that would define his sound and legacy. 

Frost’s career took off after he joined forces with legendary bluesmen such as Sonny Boy Williamson II, who mentored him and helped refine his harmonica technique. In the early 1960s, Frost formed his own band, the Night Hawks, and later became a founding member of the Jelly Roll Kings, alongside guitarist Big Jack Johnson and drummer Sam Carr. The group became a staple of the Delta blues scene, known for their raw, electrified sound and energetic live performances. Frost recorded several influential albums, including 'Hey Boss Man!' and 'Midnight Prowler,' which showcased his distinctive harmonica style and soulful vocals. 

Throughout his career, Frank Frost remained a key figure in preserving and promoting Delta blues, inspiring generations of musicians with his authentic approach and dedication to the genre. His work with the Jelly Roll Kings, in particular, helped keep the spirit of traditional blues alive well into the late 20th century. Frost passed away in 1999, but his recordings continue to be celebrated by blues enthusiasts worldwide.
