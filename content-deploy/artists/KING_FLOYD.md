## Biography
King Floyd, born on February 13, 1945, in New Orleans, Louisiana, emerged as a significant figure in classic soul and the Southern R&B scene. Raised in nearby Kenner, Floyd began singing on street corners as a teenager, forging early connections with local musicians like Earl King and Willie Tee. His first professional break came in 1961 at the Sho-Bar on Bourbon Street, aided by blues legend Mr. Google Eyes. After a stint in the Army, Floyd moved to New York City and then Los Angeles, where he worked with producer Harold Battiste and released his debut single 'Walkin' and Talkin'' in 1965, followed by the album 'A Man in Love' in 1967, co-written with Dr. John. Despite his early efforts, commercial success eluded him, and Floyd returned to New Orleans in 1969, taking a job at the post office.

Floyd's fortunes changed dramatically in 1970 when producer Wardell Quezergue recognized the potential of his song 'Groove Me.' Recorded in a single take at Malaco Studios in Jackson, Mississippi, the track became a No. 1 R&B hit and reached the Top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100, revitalizing both Floyd's career and the fortunes of Malaco Records. He followed up with hits like 'Baby Let Me Kiss You' and 'Woman Don't Go Away,' the latter earning a gold record. Floyd's music was characterized by a raw, Southern soul sound, marked by his expressive vocals and funky arrangements. Despite creative differences with Quezergue and the rise of disco, which marginalized his style, Floyd continued to record and perform sporadically, releasing his final album, 'Ol Skool Funk,' in 2000. He died on March 6, 2006, from complications of a stroke and diabetes.

King Floyd's legacy endures through his enduring hit 'Groove Me,' which has been sampled by artists such as the Wu-Tang Clan and referenced in popular culture. His influence is evident in the continued appreciation for New Orleans soul and the Southern R&B tradition, with his work serving as a bridge between classic soul and later generations of funk and hip-hop artists.
