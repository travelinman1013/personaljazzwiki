## Biography
Otis Spann (March 21, 1930 – April 24, 1970) was an American blues musician widely considered the leading postwar Chicago blues pianist.[1][2] Born in Jackson, Mississippi, to a musical family, Spann began playing piano at a young age under the tutelage of local musicians and piano legend Little Brother Montgomery.[3][4] By age 14, he was already performing in bands throughout the Jackson area, and his early exposure to blues piano came through his family's musical background and the influence of Chicago blues pioneers he would later study under.[1][3]

Spann relocated to Chicago in 1946, where Big Maceo Merriweather became his mentor and guide in the vibrant postwar Chicago blues scene.[1][5] He became Muddy Waters' piano player in late 1952 and participated in his first recording session with the band on September 24, 1953, going on to play on many of Waters' most famous songs including "Hoochie Coochie Man," "I'm Ready," and "Got My Mojo Working."[5] Beyond his work with Muddy Waters, Spann was a prolific session musician and solo recording artist, performing with Bo Diddley, Howlin' Wolf, Sonny Boy Williamson, Chuck Berry, and numerous other blues luminaries throughout his career.[1][3][5] His distinctive piano style—characterized by rumbling, rock-solid support and ruminant vocals—defined the pianist's role in postwar Chicago blues and earned him recognition as the first piano player inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1980.[2][3]

Spann died on April 24, 1970, from cancer at age 40, leaving behind an immeasurable legacy in blues music.[1][2] Tragically, he was laid in an unmarked grave for nearly 30 years until blues enthusiasts and Blues Revue Magazine collected donations to purchase a headstone unveiled in 1999.[1] Every blues piano player who followed Spann has borrowed from his influential style, cementing his position as one of the greatest blues pianists to have ever lived.[1]

## Fun Facts
- Before becoming a full-time blues musician, Spann worked various jobs including as a semi-professional football player and professional boxer.[1]
- Spann had a fondness for tall tales that resulted in a confusing biography with uncorroborated stories about his background, including conflicting accounts of his birthplace (Jackson vs. Belzoni, Mississippi) and birth year (1924 or 1930), with some sources suggesting he was considerably older than his official age of 40 at death.[3][4]
- His grave remained unmarked for nearly 30 years after his death in 1970 until blues enthusiasts and Blues Revue Magazine united to collect donations and purchase a headstone, which was unveiled in 1999 with the inscription: 'Otis played the deepest blues we ever heard- he'll play forever in our hearts.'[1]
- His only minor hit single, 'Hungry Country Girl,' recorded with the Fleetwood Mac band, was not released until after his death from cancer on April 24, 1970.[2]
