## Biography
Jean-Christophe Le Saoût, better known by the stage name Wax Tailor, is a French record producer, DJ, and talent manager born on July 19, 1975, in Vernon, Normandy.[1][2] He began his career in the 1990s as a radio host in the Paris suburb of Mantes-La-Jolie before founding the French rap group La Formule and establishing his own label, Lab'Oratoire, in 1998.[1][2] Drawing inspiration from the DJ traditions of Grandmaster Flash, Afrika Bambaataa, and French pioneers Pierre Henry and Pierre Schaeffer, Le Saoût developed a distinctive approach to music production that blended hip-hop, electronic music, and cinematic elements.[5]

Wax Tailor officially launched his solo project in 2001, making his first appearance on a remix of Looptroop and La Formule's "Deep Under Water."[2] His debut EP "Lost the Way" (2004) and first album "Tales of the Forgotten Melodies" (2005) established his signature sound—a sophisticated fusion of trip-hop, downtempo, and hip-hop enriched with samples from classic films, jazz grooves, and orchestral arrangements.[1][2] His second album "Hope & Sorrow" (2007) achieved critical acclaim, earning a nomination for Best Electronic Album at the 2008 Victoires de la Musique and winning the 2008 Independent Music Awards Vox Pop vote for best Dance/Electronica album.[2] Over his career spanning more than two decades, Wax Tailor has released six studio albums and sold nearly half a million physical copies while accumulating millions of streams globally, establishing himself as a leader in the international hip-hop electro scene.[4]

Wax Tailor's artistic approach is characterized by meticulous sound design and cinematic storytelling, incorporating dialogue and scores from classic films by Charlie Chaplin and Alfred Hitchcock into layered, orchestral hip-hop compositions.[2][5][6] His work has evolved from studio production to elaborate live performances featuring full orchestras, choirs, bands, singers, and rappers, creating what he describes as both a cinematic and intimate listening experience.[5] In January 2023, he released "Fishing For Accidents," and in March 2025, he launched a tour celebrating the 20th anniversary of his debut album across the United States, Canada, Europe, and Asia.[2]
