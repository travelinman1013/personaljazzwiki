## Biography
Alexander Anyaegbunam, professionally known as Rejjie Snow, is an Irish rapper and songwriter born on June 27, 1993, in Drumcondra, Dublin, to a Nigerian father and Irish-Jamaican mother.[1][2] Growing up on Dublin's northside, Snow was initially exposed to jazz and ska through his father's music collection and his grandparents' house, where he encountered classics by Bill Evans and Miles Davis. His musical journey began in earnest during his early teens when he became involved with a graffiti community, an experience that proved transformative. Inspired by hip-hop legends like Nas, Wu-Tang Clan, and MF DOOM, Snow moved to London at age 16 and later pursued a football scholarship in Florida before transferring to the Savannah College of Art and Design in Georgia to study film while making music on his laptop at night.[2][3]

Snow's professional music career launched with his debut EP *Rejovich* in June 2013, which immediately topped the iTunes Hip-Hop chart ahead of releases from Kanye West and J. Cole.[1] His breakthrough single "All Around the World" (2015), featuring Lily-Rose Depp, garnered 500,000 views in its first week. His debut album *Dear Annie* (2018), produced by Rahki and featuring collaborations with artists like Clairo, established him on the international stage and earned recognition in NME's best-albums-of-2018 list at number 49.[1][4] The album showcased his signature blend of jazz, soul, R&B, and hip-hop instrumentation with atmospheric production and introspective lyricism exploring themes of love and identity. Snow continued his artistic evolution with *Baw Baw Black Sheep* (2021) and *PEACE 2 DA WORLD* (2024), solidifying his position as a distinctive voice in contemporary jazz rap.[1]

Snow's artistic identity is deeply shaped by his experiences as an immigrant and outsider—first as the son of immigrants in Dublin, later as an immigrant in London, and subsequently as a Black man in America.[2] His music reflects eclectic influences ranging from N.E.R.D. and Tyler, The Creator to classic hip-hop and jazz traditions. Known for his nonchalant vocal delivery, dreamlike melodies, and metronomic flow, Snow has cultivated a dedicated fanbase through his authentic, introspective approach to hip-hop. His work demonstrates a commitment to treating music as a disciplined craft, a philosophy developed during his collegiate football years when he trained at 5 AM daily.[3]

## Fun Facts
- Snow's debut EP *Rejovich* topped the iTunes Hip-Hop chart ahead of simultaneous releases from Kanye West and J. Cole in June 2013, immediately establishing him as a rising talent.[1]
- Before fully committing to music, Snow was a talented footballer who earned a scholarship to play soccer (football) in Florida and later transferred to Savannah College of Art and Design in Georgia, where he felt like an outsider on campus because some students knew about his online music presence.[3]
- Snow initially released music under the moniker "Lecs Luther" while attending art school in Georgia, with his track "Dia Dhuit" (titled with a Gaelic greeting) released in August 2011 before he adopted the Rejjie Snow stage name.[2]
- Snow's debut album *Dear Annie* was named after an imaginary friend he speaks to throughout the album's narrative, and he chose the name because he likes "old sounding names."[3]
