## Biography
Dayna Kurtz is an acclaimed American singer-songwriter, guitarist, and producer, known for her emotionally resonant songwriting and genre-blending musical style. Born in New Jersey, Kurtz began her career as a teenager performing background music in crowded Jersey Shore beach bars, where she developed her craft by playing covers for tourists and experimenting with different styles[2][3][4]. Her early experiences taught her the fundamentals of songwriting and performance, shaping her confessional and soulful approach to music.

Over the years, Kurtz has built a formidable body of work, earning an international reputation for her riveting live performances and powerful voice[5][6]. Initially rooted in confessional singer-songwriter traditions, her style evolved to incorporate elements of jazz, blues, soul, and early rock 'n' roll, influenced by artists such as Joni Mitchell, Stevie Wonder, and theatrical rock icons like David Bowie and Queen[1]. Kurtz's move to Brooklyn and her deep connection to New Orleans further enriched her musical palette, as she became a passionate cratedigger and interpreter of lesser-known American standards and soul gems[1][6].

Kurtz's legacy is marked by her dedication to musical authenticity and her ability to connect deeply with audiences. She has released numerous albums, including 'American Standard' and 'Secret Canon Vol. 1,' and is celebrated for her collaborations with top-tier musicians. Her work is characterized by a blend of vulnerability, wit, and a commitment to making people dance, reflecting her belief in music's communal power[1][6].
