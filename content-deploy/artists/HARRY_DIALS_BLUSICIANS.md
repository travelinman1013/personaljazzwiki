## Biography
Harry Dial (1907–1987) was a pioneering American jazz drummer and bandleader, born in Birmingham, Alabama, and later active in New York. Dial began his musical journey in the early 1920s, playing drums in St. Louis with Dewey Jackson and Lawrence Marable. By the mid-1920s, he had joined the ranks of prominent jazz musicians, most notably working with Fats Waller and Louis Armstrong. His energetic drumming style, characterized by a driving beat and innovative use of the sock cymbal and snare, made him a sought-after accompanist in the swing and early jazz scenes.

In 1930, Dial formed his own ensemble, Harry Dial's Blusicians, recording six sides for Vocalion Records. The group featured notable musicians such as Omer Simeon (woodwinds), Eursten Woodfork (banjo), Shirley Clay (trumpet), and Lester Boone (alto saxophone). Throughout the 1930s, Dial continued to collaborate with Armstrong and Waller, and in the 1940s, he joined Louis Jordan's Tympany Five, expanding his repertoire to include maracas. Later in his career, Dial recorded under his own name for Decca and authored the autobiography 'All This Jazz,' reflecting on his extensive contributions to American jazz. His legacy endures as a dynamic drummer, a rare singing percussionist, and an influential figure in the development of jazz rhythm sections.
