## Biography
Charles Bradley, known as 'The Screaming Eagle of Soul,' was born in Gainesville, Florida in 1948 and raised in Brooklyn, New York after his mother brought him north at age eight. His early life was marked by hardship, including poverty, family instability, and periods of homelessness. Inspired by seeing James Brown at the Apollo Theater in 1962, Bradley began to emulate Brown's dynamic stage presence and vocal style, performing in small clubs and working odd jobs across the United States for decades.

Bradley's career took a remarkable turn late in life. After years as a James Brown impersonator under the name 'Black Velvet,' he was discovered by Gabriel Roth, co-founder of Daptone Records, in the late 1990s. Roth introduced him to guitarist and producer Thomas Brenneck, who led the Menahan Street Band. Their collaboration produced Bradley's debut album, 'No Time For Dreaming,' in 2011, when Bradley was 62. The album, and subsequent releases like 'Victim of Love' and 'Changes,' were lauded for their raw, vintage soul sound and autobiographical lyrics, reflecting Bradley's tumultuous life journey. His powerful, emotive performances and late-blooming success made him a beloved figure in the retro soul revival, earning critical acclaim and a devoted global following.

Bradley’s legacy endures through his recordings with the Menahan Street Band and other Daptone acts, his electrifying live shows, and his story of perseverance and redemption. He became a symbol of hope and authenticity in modern soul music, influencing a new generation of artists and fans before his death in 2017.
