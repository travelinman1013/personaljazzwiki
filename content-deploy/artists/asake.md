## Biography
Ahmed Ololade, known professionally as Asake, was born on January 13, 1995, in Lagos, Nigeria, and adopted his stage name as a tribute to his mother, whose first name is Asake. Raised primarily by his mother in Lagos, he attended local elementary and secondary schools before studying Theatre and Performing Arts at Obafemi Awolowo University in Ile-Ife, Osun State, where he began performing at school events and gained popularity among peers. After university, Asake explored various creative pursuits, including dancing, teaching dance, playing keyboard, skit-making, Nollywood acting, and working as a road manager for comedian Broda Shaggi in 2019, while performing at low-paying gigs and nearly quitting music before his breakthrough.[1][2][3]

Asake's career surged in 2020 with the viral freestyle 'Mr Money' produced by Magicsticks, followed by tracks like 'Lady' that caught attention from influencers such as Broda Shaggi and Sydney Talker. In February 2022, he signed with Olamide's YBNL Nation label, leading to his debut album *Mr. Money with the Vibe* in September 2022, which broke records as the biggest opening day for an African album on Apple Music and debuted at number 66 on the Billboard 200. Supported by hits like 'Sungba' (remix with Burna Boy), 'Terminator', and 'Peace Be Unto You', the album propelled him to global stardom. Subsequent releases *Work of Art* (2023) and *Lungu Boy* (2024) continued his chart success, with the latter becoming his third consecutive number one in Nigeria.[1][2][4]

Asake's musical style blends Afrobeats, Afrofusion, Amapiano, Fuji music, street hop, and Nigerian pop, featuring up-tempo beats, Yoruba vocals mixed with English and Pidgin, and traditional Yoruba percussion. Signed to YBNL Nation with an EMPIRE distribution deal, he has earned accolades including Breakout Artist of the Year at the 2022 All Africa Music Awards, two Headies, one MOBO, and nominations for BET, Grammys, and NAACP Image Awards, establishing him as a leading figure in contemporary Nigerian music.[2][3]
