## Biography
The Free Agents Brass Band is a New Orleans-based brass ensemble founded in September 2005 by bass drummer Ellis Joseph, in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Katrina[2][4]. The band emerged as a coalition of seasoned musicians who came together during a period of displacement and uncertainty, symbolizing both creative independence and resilience in the face of disaster[4]. Their name, 'Free Agents,' reflects their ethos of artistic self-determination, as the members were not tied to any single institution or band, but rather united by a shared commitment to New Orleans’ musical traditions and a desire to fill the void left by the city’s dispersed musical community[4][6]. The Free Agents quickly became a fixture on the local scene, performing at parties, clubs, parades, and funerals, and establishing a regular Sunday night residency at the Duck Off Lounge[2]. Their music blends traditional brass band sounds with funk-based tuba riffs, hip-hop lyrics, and contemporary attitudes, epitomized by their signature track 'Made It Through That Water,' a variation on the spiritual 'Wade in the Water' that directly addresses the trauma and defiance of post-Katrina New Orleans[2][4]. Over the years, the Free Agents have become recognized as torchbearers of the city’s brass band tradition, with a legacy rooted in both musical innovation and cultural preservation.
