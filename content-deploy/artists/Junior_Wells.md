## Biography
Junior Wells, born Amos Wells Blakemore Jr. on December 9, 1934, in Memphis, Tennessee, was a pioneering American blues singer, harmonica player, and recording artist who became a central figure in the Chicago blues scene. Raised in West Memphis, Arkansas, Wells was taught harmonica at a young age by his cousin Junior Parker and Sonny Boy Williamson II, mastering the instrument by age seven. After his parents' separation, he moved to Chicago with his mother in 1946 or 1948, quickly immersing himself in the city's vibrant blues culture by sitting in with local musicians at clubs and house parties.

Wells' career took off when, at just 18, he replaced Little Walter in Muddy Waters's band, recording with Waters for Chess Records in 1952. He soon established himself as a bandleader, recording singles such as 'Messin’ with the Kid' and 'Little by Little,' and became known for his energetic stage presence and modern amplified harmonica style. His 1965 album 'Hoodoo Man Blues,' recorded with guitarist Buddy Guy, is widely regarded as a classic of Chicago blues. Throughout the 1960s and '70s, Wells toured internationally, introducing electric Chicago blues to new audiences and collaborating with major artists, including opening for the Rolling Stones.

Wells' musical style blended blues, funk, and soul, and his influence extended far beyond his own recordings. He remained a fixture of the Chicago blues scene for over four decades, celebrated for his powerful voice, charismatic performances, and innovative harmonica work. Junior Wells died of cancer on January 15, 1998, in Chicago, leaving a lasting legacy as one of the genre’s most important and influential artists.
