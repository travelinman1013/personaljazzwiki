## Biography
Melody Gardot is an American jazz singer, songwriter, and musician born in 1985 in New Jersey and raised primarily by her grandparents. Early exposure to her family's vinyl collection—rich with jazz legends like Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday, and Nina Simone—inspired her deep love for the genre. Gardot began performing in Philadelphia piano bars as a teenager, developing a style that blends jazz, blues, folk, and pop influences. Initially pursuing a career in art, her trajectory changed dramatically at age 19 after a severe bicycle accident left her with significant injuries. As part of her recovery, a physician recommended music therapy to help restore her cognitive abilities, prompting her to write and record songs from her hospital bed. These early works became her first EP, 'Some Lessons: The Bedroom Sessions' (2005), followed by her debut album 'Worrisome Heart' (2007), which established her as a rising star in vocal jazz.

Gardot's music is characterized by her hauntingly smooth alto voice, evocative lyrics, and a sophisticated blend of jazz, blues, and folk. Her 2010 album 'My One and Only Thrill,' produced by Larry Klein, further showcased her versatility with Latin rhythms and lush string arrangements, earning her a Grammy nomination and international acclaim. Despite ongoing health challenges, Gardot has continued to evolve artistically, releasing multiple albums and gaining a devoted following, particularly in Europe. Her artistry is often compared to jazz greats, yet she remains celebrated for her originality and ability to convey deep emotion through her music.
