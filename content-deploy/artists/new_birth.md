## Biography
New Birth is an American R&B and funk collective whose roots go back to 1963, when saxophonist Tony Churchill and veteran producer–songwriter Harvey Fuqua formed the instrumental band the Nite-Liters in Louisville, Kentucky.[1][3][4] The Nite-Liters built a regional reputation with tight, horn-driven soul instrumentals, eventually scoring several R&B chart entries and attracting the attention of music entrepreneur Vernon Bullock, who envisioned a touring company that could function both as separate acts and as a single showpiece ensemble.[1][3] Bullock and Fuqua began assembling vocal groups around the Nite-Liters: a male quartet called The Now Sound, a female quartet called the Mint Juleps, and lead singer Alan Frye (also spelled Frey), all of whom would record individually yet be marketed collectively under the new name **New Birth**, symbolizing a new sound and beginning.[1][2][3]

In the early 1970s New Birth evolved from a loose production concept into a full-fledged large-scale group, at one point a 17‑piece ensemble blending the Nite-Liters’ rhythm section and horns with multiple vocalists.[1][2][3] A key turning point came when Fuqua and Bullock added the Detroit trio Love, Peace & Happiness—featuring former Marvelettes singer Ann Bogan and brothers Melvin and Leslie Wilson, who brought powerful gospel-inflected lead vocals rooted in their upbringing in Muskegon, Michigan church groups.[1][3] With this lineup the group released a run of albums on RCA, including “New Birth” (1970), “Ain’t No Big Thing, But It’s Growing” (1971), “Birth Day” (1972), and “Coming Together” (1972), scoring R&B hits with their cover of Bobby Womack’s “I Can Understand It” and, later, the album “It’s Been a Long Time” (1974), whose title track and a version of Skylark’s “Wildflower” solidified their reputation for dramatic, emotionally charged slow jams as well as gritty funk.[1][3] After leaving RCA and Fuqua’s management, they signed to Buddah Records and achieved their sole No. 1 R&B single with a cover of Jerry Butler’s “Dream Merchant” on the 1975 album “Blind Baby,” while subsequent releases for Warner Bros., including “Behold the Mighty Army” (1977), were marked by internal disputes that led to the departure of the Wilson brothers and, ultimately, splintered lineups.[1][3]

Stylistically, New Birth combined the tight, horn-heavy arrangements of late‑1960s soul and funk with rich vocal harmonies and gospel-steeped lead singing that prefigured the emotive “quiet storm” ballad style later associated with classic soul radio.[1][3][4] Their sound drew on the Motown pedigree of Fuqua and Bogan, Southern and Midwestern gospel traditions, and contemporary funk bands of the era, but their large-ensemble format and blend of male and female voices gave them a distinctive theatrical presence that translated strongly on stage.[1][3] Though commercial fortunes waned after the late 1970s and various incarnations of the band came and went—including revamped lineups led by Melvin and Leslie Wilson in the late 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, and a 2000s revival—their records have remained influential, sampled, and covered by later R&B and hip‑hop artists, and individual members such as Leslie Wilson have been cited as important vocal influences on subsequent soul singers.[1][3]

## Fun Facts
- New Birth did not begin as a single band but as a collective of separate acts—the Nite-Liters, The Now Sound, Mint Juleps, and later Love, Peace & Happiness—who could perform individually or merge into one large ensemble under the New Birth name.[1][2][3]
- At their commercial peak, New Birth functioned as a 17‑piece group, an unusually large configuration for a soul‑funk act, giving them an orchestral stage sound with multiple vocalists and a full horn section.[2][3]
- During their early success, members of New Birth lived together in a mansion in the Hollywood Hills dubbed “the band house,” reflecting both their tight‑knit structure and the scale of the operation.[1]
- New Birth’s songs have been widely covered and sampled across genres, with artists such as K‑Ci & JoJo, The Notorious B.I.G., De La Soul, and Something for the People drawing on their recordings decades after the group’s 1970s heyday.[1][3]
