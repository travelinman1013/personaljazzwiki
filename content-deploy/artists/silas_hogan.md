## Biography
Silas Hogan (September 15, 1911 – January 9, 1994) was an American blues guitarist, singer, and songwriter closely associated with the Baton Rouge, Louisiana, **swamp blues** tradition.[3][4][5][6] He was born in Westover, in West Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana, and raised on a farm in nearby Irene, north of Baton Rouge, where he worked as a farmer and later as a laborer while playing music on the side.[5][6] Like many rural Southern musicians of his generation, Hogan first performed at local house parties, juke joints, and informal gatherings, developing a relaxed but insistent guitar style and a conversational vocal delivery that reflected both country blues roots and evolving regional sounds.[4][5]

Hogan became a central figure in the Baton Rouge blues scene during the 1950s and 1960s, a period when the local idiom came to be known as "swamp blues"—a term he himself helped explain, recalling musicians holding jam sessions on porches overlooking Devil's Swamp near Scotlandville.[5] In the early 1960s he recorded for producer J.D. "Jay" Miller in Crowley, cutting sides for Excello Records that included his best-known titles such as **"Airport Blues"** and **"Lonesome La La"**.[1][3][4] These recordings showcased his steady, rolling rhythm guitar, sparse but pointed lead lines, and lyrics that blended everyday storytelling with a moody, brooding atmosphere typical of south Louisiana blues.[4][5] Although he did not achieve major commercial success, Hogan remained respected locally, performed into the 1980s (including at events such as the National Blues Festival in Atlanta), and came to be regarded as one of the tradition bearers of classic Baton Rouge swamp blues.[5]

Hogan’s musical legacy lies in his role as an exemplar of the older rural Louisiana style that persisted in Baton Rouge even as more urban and electric forms took hold.[5] By the mid‑1980s he was noted as one of only two musicians in Baton Rouge still playing in the older south Louisiana rural style, marking him as a crucial link between early postwar country blues and later swamp blues performers.[5] His recordings for Excello and later reissues on specialist labels have ensured that his work remains available to blues listeners and researchers, and his reputation as a foundational Baton Rouge bluesman—sometimes referred to as "the Godfather" of the local scene—has grown posthumously as interest in regional blues traditions has expanded.[5]

## Fun Facts
- Hogan helped explain the origin of the term "swamp blues," recalling that Baton Rouge bluesmen held jam sessions on porches overlooking Devil’s Swamp near Scotlandville and began calling their highly percussive sound the "swamp sound."[5]
- Despite being a respected recording artist, Hogan spent much of his life working outside of music—raised as a farmer in Irene, Louisiana, he balanced manual labor with night and weekend performances.[5][6]
- By the mid‑1980s Hogan was recognized as one of only two Baton Rouge musicians still playing in the older south Louisiana rural blues style, making him a living link to an earlier era of Louisiana blues.[5]
- Hogan’s best-known songs, including "Airport Blues" and "Lonesome La La," were recorded relatively late in his life, during his fifties, illustrating how many rural blues artists reached record company studios only after decades of local performing.[1][3][4]

## Musical Connections

### Mentors/Influences
- [[jimmy_reed|Jimmy Reed]] - Hogan identified Jimmy Reed as the key bluesman that Baton Rouge musicians, including himself, listened to and drew ideas from in the late 1950s and 1960s, shaping elements of the swamp blues sound such as walking bass lines and relaxed, slurred vocals.[5] (General stylistic influence heard in Hogan’s 1960s Excello-era recordings such as "Airport Blues" and "Lonesome La La" (inferred by style and period, not tied to a single documented track).) [Late 1950s–1960s[5]]

### Key Collaborators
- [[arthur_guitar_kelly|Arthur "Guitar" Kelly]] - Fellow Baton Rouge bluesman who appeared with Hogan at events such as the National Blues Festival in Atlanta, reflecting their shared role in representing Baton Rouge swamp blues on national stages.[5] (Live performances including National Blues Festival in Atlanta (mid‑1980s).) [1980s[5]]

### Artists Influenced
- [[baton_rouge_swamp_blues_musicians_collective_influence|Baton Rouge swamp blues musicians (collective influence)]] - Hogan was cited as a traditional Baton Rouge bluesman and older rural-style player—referred to in local commentary as "Silas 'the Godfather' Hogan"—whose style embodied the classic swamp blues sound that later Baton Rouge artists learned from and built upon.[5] (Influence reflected broadly in later Baton Rouge swamp blues recordings rather than a single documented track (inference based on his role described in regional blues histories).) [1960s onward[5]]
