## Biography
Bettye Swann, born Betty Jean Champion on October 24, 1944, in Shreveport, Louisiana, is a celebrated American soul singer best known for her 1967 chart-topping hit "Make Me Yours." Raised in Arcadia, Louisiana, as one of 14 children, Swann began singing gospel in church before moving to Los Angeles in 1963 to pursue a music career. She adopted the stage name Bettye Swann at the suggestion of DJ Al Scott, who became her manager. Her early solo efforts included the self-penned "Don’t Wait Too Long," but her breakthrough came with "Make Me Yours," which reached No. 1 on the Billboard R&B chart and No. 21 on the Hot 100 in 1967.

Following her initial success, Swann signed with Capitol Records and scored another hit with her soulful rendition of "Don't Touch Me" in 1969. In the early 1970s, she joined Atlantic Records, releasing a series of singles including "Victim of a Foolish Heart" and "Today I Started Loving You Again." Despite her emotive voice and critical acclaim, Swann's commercial success waned, and she retired from performing after her husband and manager George Barton's death in 1980. Swann subsequently changed her name to Betty Barton, became a Jehovah’s Witness, and pursued a career in education in Las Vegas.

Swann's musical style is marked by her deeply expressive, gospel-infused vocals and heartfelt delivery, which resonated with soul and northern soul audiences. Though she never achieved the fame of some contemporaries, her recordings have gained renewed appreciation among collectors and soul enthusiasts, cementing her legacy as one of the genre’s most underrated voices.
