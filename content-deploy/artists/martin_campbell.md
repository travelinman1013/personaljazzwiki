## Biography
Martin Campbell is a Jamaican-born, UK-raised singer, multi-instrumentalist, producer, and engineer whose work has been pivotal in preserving the roots reggae tradition from the late 1970s to the present. Born in Germany in 1955 to Jamaican parents, Campbell moved to Jamaica as a young child, where he developed his musical talent early—becoming an accomplished pianist by age seven and attending the renowned Alpha Boys' School. His family later relocated to England in the late 1960s, where he immersed himself in the burgeoning UK reggae scene, drawing inspiration from both Caribbean and British influences.

Campbell's career is marked by a fiercely independent, do-it-yourself ethos. He established his own studio and label, Log On! Records, in the early 1980s, releasing spiritually charged roots tracks like 'Jah is My Light.' He is also the founder of Channel One (UK), a nod to the legendary Jamaican studio that shaped his sonic ideals. Campbell's music is characterized by minimalist, analog-driven grooves, heavy basslines, and a meditative, spiritual lyrical focus. His work bridges the classic message-driven reggae of the 1970s with the modern global dub revival, earning him respect as a quiet legend in UK dub and roots circles.

Throughout his decades-long career, Campbell has collaborated with key figures in the UK and European dub scenes, including projects under the Hi-Tech Roots Dynamics alias and work with Alien Dread. His records are staples for sound systems and selectors across Europe, and his influence is felt among a new generation of dub producers and vocalists. Rather than chasing commercial trends, Campbell has built a legacy rooted in authenticity, spiritual uplift, and the enduring power of roots reggae.
