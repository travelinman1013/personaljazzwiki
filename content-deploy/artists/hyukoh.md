## Biography
HYUKOH (혁오) is a South Korean indie rock band formed in Seoul’s Hongdae scene in May 2014, led by vocalist and guitarist Oh Hyuk alongside guitarist Lim Hyun-jae, bassist Im Dong-geon, and drummer Lee In-woo.[1][3][4] All four members were born in 1993, and the band’s name comes from its frontman, who was born in South Korea but moved to China as a baby and spent his youth in cities including Jilin, Shenyang, and Beijing before returning to Korea in 2012 to study fine arts at Hongik University.[1][2] Initially, Oh Hyuk performed solo under the name “Hyukoh,” writing much of the material that became the band’s debut EP "20," released on September 18, 2014; he then recruited Lim, Im, and Lee to form the full band and began building a following in small Hongdae live clubs.[1][4][5]

The band’s early releases, including EPs "20" (2014) and "22" (2015), showcased a sound that departed from highly produced K-pop, blending 1990s indie rock, soft rock, and contemporary shoegaze with intimate lyrics sung in both Korean and English.[2][3][5] Their reputation grew rapidly through word of mouth and opening slots for international acts such as Mac DeMarco and How to Dress Well, before a breakout appearance on the hugely popular variety show *Infinite Challenge* in summer 2015 propelled them into the mainstream, with their song "Comes and Goes" topping South Korean charts over major K-pop groups.[1][4][5] That same year, they signed as the first act to Tablo’s independent label HIGHGRND, backed by YG Entertainment, while remaining managed by indie company DRDR AMC.[1] Subsequent projects, including their full-length album "23," solidified HYUKOH as key figures in a “post–K-pop” generation of Korean music, celebrated for offering a more organic band sound and emotionally resonant songwriting within the broader Korean music landscape.[2][6]

HYUKOH’s legacy lies in proving that an indie rock quartet could compete commercially with Korea’s biggest idol acts while maintaining artistic autonomy and a multi-genre approach.[3][5][6] Their willingness to mix genres freely, write candidly about relationships and life, and sing across languages has made them a touchstone band for younger Korean musicians seeking alternatives to the idol system.[2][5][6] Frequently described as central to Hongdae’s modern indie identity, HYUKOH helped broaden international perceptions of Korean music beyond K-pop by touring globally and appearing at major rock festivals, positioning them as one of the most influential Korean bands of their generation.[3][4][6]

## Fun Facts
- All four HYUKOH members were born in 1993, and their early releases "20", "22" and album "23" correspond to their ages at the time.[1][4][6]
- Before forming the full band, Oh Hyuk performed solo under the name “Hyukoh,” writing most of the songs that later appeared on the debut EP "20" while he was still living in Beijing.[1][5]
- HYUKOH’s song "Comes and Goes" became so ubiquitous after their 2015 breakthrough that it reportedly could be heard coming from shops all over Seoul, surpassing releases by top K-pop acts on the charts.[5]
- Oh Hyuk often writes lyrics in both Korean and English, explaining that he actually finds it harder to write in Korean because he feels pressure to do it perfectly as a native speaker.[5]
