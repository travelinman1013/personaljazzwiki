## Biography
Susan Tedeschi, born November 9, 1970, in Boston, Massachusetts, is a celebrated American blues and soul singer, guitarist, and songwriter. Raised in Norwell, Massachusetts, in a family of Italian heritage, Tedeschi was immersed in music from an early age, influenced by her father’s blues record collection and her experiences singing in local choirs and theater. She pursued formal music education at Berklee College of Music, earning a Bachelor of Music in composition and performance, and deepened her connection to gospel and blues through participation in gospel choirs and the vibrant Boston music scene.

Tedeschi formed the Susan Tedeschi Band in 1993, quickly gaining a reputation for her powerful vocals and expressive guitar work. Her debut album, 'Better Days' (1995), set the stage for her breakthrough with 'Just Won’t Burn' (1998), which achieved Gold status—a rare feat for a blues artist. Over the next decade, she released acclaimed albums such as 'Wait for Me,' 'Hope and Desire,' and 'Back to the River,' and became known for her dynamic live performances. In 2010, she co-founded the Tedeschi Trucks Band with her husband, renowned guitarist Derek Trucks. Their debut album, 'Revelator,' won the Grammy Award for Best Blues Album in 2012, cementing her legacy as a leading force in modern blues.

Tedeschi’s musical style blends classic blues, rock, R&B, and gospel, marked by her soulful voice and emotive guitar playing. She is recognized for revitalizing the blues genre and inspiring a new generation of musicians, earning multiple Grammy nominations and a place among the most influential blues artists of her era.
