## Biography
Joe Ely was born on February 9, 1947, in Amarillo, Texas, and raised on the vast plains of West Texas, particularly in Lubbock, where he grew up immersed in the local music scene. As a teenager, he practiced with small country bands and later co-founded the influential Flatlanders trio in the early 1970s with Jimmie Dale Gilmore and Butch Hancock, releasing their debut album *All American Music*, which initially went overlooked but later became a cornerstone of West Texas country storytelling.[3][4][5][6] Ely emerged as a solo artist in 1977 with his self-titled debut album, blending hardcore honky-tonk, Tex-Mex, rockabilly, and rock 'n' roll swagger, quickly establishing himself as a rebellious voice in outlaw country.[1][2]

Throughout his four-decade career, Ely released acclaimed albums like *Honky Tonk Masquerade* (1978), *Down on the Drag* (1979), *Lord of the Highway* (1987), and *Dig All Night* (1988), while touring extensively from Lubbock to London and facing personal challenges including IRS investigations and equipment thefts that forced solo acoustic tours.[1][2] His live performances were legendary, captivating diverse audiences, and he pioneered genres including outlaw country, alt-country, Texas country, and Americana, earning recognition as one of the best songwriters of his generation.[1][3][4] Ely also ventured into theater with the play *Chippy* (1993) and novels like *Super Reverb* (2000), while continuing Flatlanders reunions and collaborations.[2]

Ely's legacy endures through his raw, eclectic sound and contributions to progressive country, honored as the Official 2016 Texas State Musician by the Texas Legislature; he passed away on December 15, 2025, at age 78 in Taos, New Mexico, from complications of Lewy Body Dementia, Parkinson's disease, and pneumonia.[3][4][6]
