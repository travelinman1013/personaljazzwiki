## Biography
Sheila Escovedo, known professionally as Sheila E., was born in 1957 in Oakland, California, into a renowned musical family of Mexican and French Creole ancestry. The daughter of percussionist Pete Escovedo, who played with Santana, and influenced by uncles Coke Escovedo, Alejandro Escovedo, Mario Escovedo, Javier Escovedo, and godfather Tito Puente, she began mimicking her father's drum movements at age three and gave her first public performance at age five to an audience of 3,000. At 15, she filled in on congas with her father's band Azteca, and by 19, she recorded on Alphonso Johnson's jazz album Yesterday’s Dream, leaving high school to pursue percussion professionally.[1][5][6][8]
