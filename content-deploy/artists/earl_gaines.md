## Biography
Earl Gaines Jr. (August 19, 1935 – December 31, 2009) was a pivotal figure in American soul blues and electric blues, renowned for his commanding voice and emotive delivery. Born in Decatur, Alabama, Gaines grew up on a farm, spending his early years helping his family with farm work and singing spirituals in church. His exposure to blues music came from listening to late-night radio, which sparked his passion for rhythm and blues.[1][5] In 1951, a Christmas visit to Nashville led to his permanent relocation, where he began his professional career as a demo singer for influential songwriter Ted Jarrett.[1][2]

Gaines's breakthrough came in 1955 as the lead vocalist on Louis Brooks & His Hi-Toppers' hit "It's Love Baby (24 Hours a Day)," a song that reached No. 2 on the Billboard R&B chart. Though his name was not credited on the record, this performance established him as a major voice in Nashville's burgeoning R&B scene.[2][1] He went on to tour nationally with the R&B Caravan of Stars, sharing stages with legends like Bo Diddley and Etta James. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Gaines recorded for several labels, achieving regional hits such as "The Best of Luck to You" (1966) and "Hymn Number 5" (1973), and appearing on the influential TV show The !!!! Beat. Despite a period away from music in the late 1970s and early 1980s, Gaines returned with acclaimed albums in the 1990s, demonstrating his enduring vocal power and versatility.[1][2][3]

Gaines's musical style blended deep soul, blues, and R&B, marked by his rich, expressive baritone and technical skill. He was a central figure in Nashville's black music community, helping to elevate the city's reputation in the national soul and blues landscape. His legacy endures through his recordings, influence on fellow musicians, and recognition in exhibits like the Country Music Hall of Fame's "Night Train to Nashville."[1][3]
