## Biography
Winston Rodney, known as Burning Spear, was born on March 1, 1945, in Saint Ann's Bay, Saint Ann Parish, Jamaica, the same birthplace as Bob Marley and Marcus Garvey, whose philosophies deeply influenced his Rastafarian beliefs and music.[3][2] Growing up in rural Jamaica, he listened to R&B, soul, and jazz from U.S. radio broadcasts, with artists like Curtis Mayfield and James Brown shaping his early sound, while working odd jobs including as a tailor before pursuing music full-time after age 24.[2][7][8] A pivotal encounter with Bob Marley led Rodney to Studio One, where he recorded his debut single 'Door Peep' in 1969 with partner Rupert Willington, later expanding to a trio with Delroy Hinds and saxophonist Cedric Brooks, establishing his roots reggae style rooted in spiritual, African heritage themes.[1][3][6]

Burning Spear's career exploded in the 1970s with the Island Records album *Marcus Garvey* (1975), featuring tracks like 'Slavery Days' and 'Old Marcus Garvey,' blending reggae with hippie vibes and prophetic Rastafari messages.[1][6] He formed his Burning Music Production label in 1973, transitioned to a solo project backed by bands like the Black Disciples and Aswad, and released influential albums such as *Rocking Time* (1974), *Hail H.I.M.* (1980), and *Social Living* (1978), incorporating jazz and funk elements while maintaining deep roots reggae.[6][7][8] Extensive touring, including U.K. shows with Aswad captured on live albums, built his global legend status after Marley's death.[6]

A two-time Grammy winner for *Calling Rastafari* (2000) and *Jah Is Real* (2009), Burning Spear remains a custodian of roots reggae, with over 14 albums, countless tours, and 12 Grammy nominations, preaching black separatist activism and peace through his luminous, spiritual voice.[1][2][5]
