## Biography
Robin Miriam Carlsson, known professionally as Robyn, is a Swedish singer, songwriter, record producer, and DJ born on June 12, 1979, in Stockholm, Sweden.[2][3] She was discovered by Swedish pop singer Meja in the early 1990s when Meja and her band, Legacy of Sound, visited Robyn's school as part of a musical workshop.[1][2] Impressed by Robyn's performance, Meja facilitated a meeting with her management. At age 14, after completing middle school education in 1993, Robyn signed with Ricochet Records Sweden (which was acquired by BMG in 1994), collaborating with producers Max Martin and Denniz Pop, who shaped her distinctive sound.[1][2]

Robyn began her pop music career at age 15, signing with RCA Records in 1994 and releasing her debut single "You've Got That Somethin'" in Sweden.[1][2] Her Swedish breakthrough came later that year with "Do You Really Want Me (Show Respect)." Her 1995 debut album *Robyn Is Here* achieved international success, producing two Billboard Hot 100 top 10 singles: "Do You Know (What It Takes)" and "Show Me Love."[1][2][4] Her second and third albums, *My Truth* (1999) and *Don't Stop the Music* (2002), were released primarily in Sweden and Europe.[1][2] In 2005, she released her fourth album, *Robyn*, which became her first number-one album in Sweden and earned her three 2006 Swedish Grammy Awards for Best Album, Best Writer (with Klas Åhlund), and Best Pop Female.[1][2]

Robyn is best known for her critically acclaimed electropop music, impressive live shows, and hit singles including "With Every Heartbeat" (UK number one) and "Dancing On My Own" (UK number 8, Sweden number one).[3] Her musical style is influenced by electronica, rap, R&B, and new-age music.[1][2][3] She has maintained a presence in the music industry since 1989 and has collaborated with notable artists including Norwegian electronic band Röyksopp and served as supporting act for Madonna's Sticky & Sweet Tour at select European dates in 2008.[3]

## Fun Facts
- Robyn recorded her first professional song, "Du kan alltid bli nummer ett" ("You Can Always be Number One"), as the theme song for the Swedish television show Lilla Sportspegeln at just 12 years old in 1991.[2]
- Her second album *My Truth* (1999) was not released in the United States despite her earlier US success with *Robyn Is Here*, due to the album's discussion of an abortion the singer had experienced.[3]
- In January 2009, Robyn won a Swedish Grammis Award for Best Live Act 2008, recognizing her impressive live performance abilities.[3]
- The title track from her 2002 album *Don't Stop the Music* was later covered by Swedish girl group Play, and the lead single "Keep This Fire Burning" was covered by British soul singer Beverley Knight.[1][2]
