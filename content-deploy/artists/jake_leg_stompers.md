## Biography
The Jake Leg Stompers are a Tennessee-based band dedicated to reviving and performing pre-World War II American roots music. Formed in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, the group specializes in the lively, rebellious sounds of early 20th-century American music, including Memphis jug band, Appalachian hillbilly, and early jazz and blues traditions. Their performances are characterized by the use of period instruments and authentic arrangements, capturing the spirit of a time when folk, blues, and jazz were still deeply intertwined and evolving[1][2][4].

The band was founded and is led by Ron Bombardi, a philosophy professor, and Bill Steber, an alumnus of the MTSU photo department. The Jake Leg Stompers have become known for their energetic live shows and their commitment to historical accuracy, both in musical style and instrumentation.
