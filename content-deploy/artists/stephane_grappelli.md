## Biography
Stéphane Grappelli (1908–1997) was a pioneering French-Italian jazz violinist born in Paris on January 26, 1908, to a French mother and Italian father. Orphaned of his mother at age four, he endured hardships during World War I, living in poverty and initially studying piano and violin informally before attending the Paris Conservatory. Largely self-taught in jazz, his style crystallized after hearing Joe Venuti's violin playing in 1928, inspiring him to blend classical technique with improvisational jazz.[1][2][3]
