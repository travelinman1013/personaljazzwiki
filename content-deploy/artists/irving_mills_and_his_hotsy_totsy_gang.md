## Biography
Irving Mills and His Hotsy Totsy Gang was a studio jazz ensemble formed in the late 1920s by Irving Mills, a prominent American music publisher, lyricist, and band manager. Mills, originally from Odessa, Ukraine, immigrated to the United States and became a key figure in the New York music scene, co-founding Mills Music with his brother Jack, which grew to be one of the largest independent music publishers worldwide[4]. Mills was not a musician himself, though he occasionally sang; instead, he was known for his business acumen and his ability to assemble top-tier jazz talent for recording sessions.

The Hotsy Totsy Gang was active primarily between 1928 and 1930, bringing together some of the era's finest white jazz musicians, including Tommy Dorsey, Jimmy Dorsey, Joe Venuti, Eddie Lang, Arnold Brillhardt, Arthur Schutt, and Manny Klein[1][4]. The group was not a regular performing band but rather a 'recording-only' ensemble, with Mills acting as arranger, producer, and sometimes vocalist. Their recordings, which ranged from hot jazz to lively dance music, were noted for their energetic performances and innovative arrangements, often described as 'so hot that the music should be written on sheets of asbestos'[3][4].

Irving Mills' legacy extends beyond the Hotsy Totsy Gang; he managed and promoted major jazz acts such as Duke Ellington, Cab Calloway, and the Mills Blue Rhythm Band, and was instrumental in the early commercial success of these artists. The Hotsy Totsy Gang's sessions are remembered for their star-studded lineups and their contribution to the development of big band and ragtime jazz, influencing both contemporaries and future generations of musicians[3][5].
