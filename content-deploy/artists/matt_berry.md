## Biography
Matt Berry, born in 1974 in Bedfordshire, England, is a multifaceted English musician, actor, comedian, and writer. Raised in a creative household, Berry taught himself to play the organ and guitar after his parents left an organ in his room as a child. He later studied Contemporary Arts at Nottingham Trent University, where he joined various bands and began experimenting with recording techniques, often working alone and producing his own music in makeshift home studios. 

Berry’s music career is as eclectic as his comedic output. Signed to Acid Jazz Records, he has released a series of critically acclaimed albums that traverse genres including acid jazz, prog rock, chamber folk, psychedelic pop, and new age electronic instrumentals. Notable albums such as 'Witchazel,' 'Kill the Wolf,' and 'Phantom Birds' showcase his ability to blend influences from 1970s British folk and prog with modern sensibilities. Berry is known for playing most instruments on his recordings, with only occasional contributions from other musicians, particularly drummers. His musical style is marked by a fascination with vintage sounds, long-form compositions, and a hands-on approach to production, often drawing inspiration from artists like Mike Oldfield and Jean Michel Jarre.

While Berry is perhaps best known to the public for his comedic roles in series such as 'The IT Crowd,' 'Toast of London,' and 'What We Do in the Shadows,' his musical legacy is substantial. Over a decade with Acid Jazz, he has developed a reputation for originality and genre-blending, with each album reflecting a distinct conceptual or stylistic shift. Berry’s work is characterized by a deep respect for musical craftsmanship, a willingness to experiment, and a unique ability to fuse humor and musicianship, making him a singular figure in contemporary British music.
