## Biography
Nadav Remez is an Israeli-born jazz guitarist, composer, and arranger whose music blends modern jazz, alternative rock, and Jewish folk influences. Raised on the outskirts of Tel Aviv, his musical journey began in earnest at the Thelma Yellin High School for the Arts, a renowned institution that exposed him to a wide array of musical traditions from both Western and Eastern cultures. This diverse foundation helped him develop a unique artistic voice, characterized by melodic inventiveness and a thoughtful approach to composition.

In 2005, Remez received a full scholarship to the Berklee College of Music in Boston, where he further honed his craft. He was a semi-finalist in the prestigious Montreux Gibson Jazz Guitar Competition in 2007, and continued his studies at the New England Conservatory, learning from jazz luminaries such as Miguel Zénon, Billy Hart, and George Garzone. Remez quickly became a sought-after musician in the Boston and New York jazz scenes, collaborating with notable artists and performing at esteemed venues like the Blue Note in New York and the Nancy Jazz Pulsations in France. His debut album, 'So Far,' released in 2011, was celebrated for its poignant melodies and innovative fusion of styles, establishing him as a compelling new voice in contemporary jazz.

Now based in Brooklyn, New York, Remez continues to push musical boundaries, with projects that reflect his multicultural background and personal experiences. His work is noted for its emotional depth, sophisticated harmonies, and a distinctive blend of jazz improvisation with folk and rock elements, earning him recognition among critics and peers alike.
