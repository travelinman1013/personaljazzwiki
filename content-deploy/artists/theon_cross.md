## Biography
Theon Cross, a Londoner with Caribbean ancestry, began his musical journey at age 8 in primary school, starting on the tenor horn before switching to euphonium and then tuba during secondary school[1][7][8]. He trained intensively at Lewisham Music from a young age, became an alumnus of the legendary Tomorrow's Warriors jazz ensemble, and graduated from the prestigious Guildhall School of Music, honing his technical mastery and theoretical knowledge through jazz workshops and jam nights across London[2][3][5]. This early development fueled his unique vision, redefining the tuba—an instrument largely absent from jazz since the 1930s—by expanding its sonic possibilities into a versatile 'sound-system' capable of subsonics, bass, mids, tops, multiphonics, and pedal tones, deeply rooted in Afro-Diaspora Music (ADM) and his African-Caribbean heritage[1][2][3][5]. Since 2013, Cross has been a core member of the MOBO award-winning Sons Of Kemet, contributing seismic tuba bass lines and touring globally, while also playing regularly with Nubya Garcia, Moses Boyd Exodus, Steamdown, and Cassie Kinoshi’s SEED Ensemble[2][3][4][5]. His solo career launched with the 2015 EP *Aspiration*, earning Jazz FM Best Newcomer and Parliamentary Award nominations, followed by the 2019 debut album *Fyah*—a fiery, groove-driven release that topped UK jazz charts, garnered Jazz FM and Worldwide FM nominations, and won him Downbeat’s 67th Critics’ Poll 'Rising Star' award—and the 2021 album *Intra-I*, blending jazz with hip-hop, grime, reggae, dub, and soca to celebrate Black music, self-reliance, identity, and post-war Caribbean immigrant resilience[1][2][3][4][5]. Cross's innovative style bridges ensemble jazz, road marches, grime, reggae, afrobeat, and soca, making him an indispensable force in the UK jazz scene with collaborations spanning dozens of award-nominated projects[2][3]. His legacy lies in revitalizing the tuba as a dance music heavyweight and total 21st-century sound-system, influencing contemporary jazz through diasporic bass culture and sound system lineage from Jamaica to London[1][3][5][6].
