## Biography
Dori Freeman is an American singer-songwriter from Galax, Virginia, a small Appalachian town in the Blue Ridge Mountains.[1] She grew up in a deeply musical family—her father Scott Freeman and grandfather Willard Gayheart are both musicians, and her family owns the Front Porch Gallery and Frame Shop, part of Virginia's heritage music trail known as The Crooked Road.[1] Freeman was raised on bluegrass and traditional mountain music, with early influences including Doc Watson and the Louvin Brothers, alongside artists like Nanci Griffith, Linda Ronstadt, and even Supertramp, introduced to her by her father.[3][7]

Freeman's professional career began in earnest when she caught the attention of producer Teddy Thompson via Facebook in late 2014; Thompson was so impressed that he decided to produce her debut album, which was funded through Kickstarter and released in February 2016.[1] Her self-titled debut received critical acclaim, with Rolling Stone Country calling it "a strong contender for Americana debut of the year" and The New York Times praising "the purity of Dori Freeman's voice and the directness of her songwriting."[1] Rather than relocating to Nashville like many of her peers, Freeman chose to remain in Galax, Virginia, where she lives with her husband Nicholas Falk, a session drummer and producer.[3]

Over five studio albums, Freeman has evolved her signature Appalachian Americana sound from country traditionalism to increasingly amplified and electric arrangements.[2] Her 2021 album Ten Thousand Roses marked a shift toward percussion-driven, electrified folk, produced by her husband Nicholas Falk.[3][6] Her most recent album, Do You Recall (2023), represents her most eclectic work yet, featuring collaborations with Teddy Thompson and her father, and marking her first albums where she co-wrote songs with other writers.[2] Freeman is recognized as one of the most authentic vocalists from southwestern Virginia, while simultaneously challenging Appalachian stereotypes through her songwriting and artistic vision.[4]

## Fun Facts
- Freeman silenced a talkative audience at Cannery Row in Nashville by launching into an a cappella performance mid-set, demonstrating her commanding stage presence.[3]
- She attended Virginia Tech University but dropped out before graduating to pursue her music career full-time.[8]
- Freeman has deliberately resisted the industry pressure to relocate to Nashville, believing that living in rural Galax allows her to develop her music in a way that is truer to her personal vision and free from genre expectations.[4]
- Her daughter showed dramatic flair and attended acting camp, leading Freeman to believe she may pursue acting as a career path.[3]
