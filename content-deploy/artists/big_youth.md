## Biography
Manley Augustus Buchanan, known professionally as Big Youth, was born on April 19, 1949, in Trenchtown, Kingston, Jamaica—a neighborhood renowned for its influence on reggae music. Before entering the music industry, Buchanan worked as a diesel mechanic at Kingston’s Sheraton Hotel, where his colleagues nicknamed him 'Big Youth' due to his youthful age and tall stature. He began developing his unique toasting style while working, inspired by pioneering deejay U-Roy, and soon became a regular on Lord Tippertone’s sound system by 1970, attracting the attention of Kingston’s record producers.

Big Youth’s career took off in the early 1970s with hits like 'The Killer' and 'S-90 Skank,' the latter becoming his first number one hit in Jamaica. His debut album, 'Screaming Target' (1973), is considered a classic of roots reggae and showcased his innovative blend of toasting and singjay vocals. Throughout the 1970s, he worked with influential producers such as Gussie Clarke, Glen Brown, Yabby You, and Bunny Wailer, and later began self-producing on his own Negusa Nagast and Augustus Buchanan labels, often backed by the Soul Syndicate band. Big Youth’s lyrics were notable for their conscious messages on Rastafarianism, social justice, and youth empowerment, distinguishing him from many contemporaries.

Although his popularity waned with the rise of new deejay styles in the late 1970s and 1980s, Big Youth’s impact endured. He signed with Virgin Records’ Frontline label, appeared in the iconic reggae film 'Rockers,' and continued to perform and record sporadically into the 2000s. Big Youth is widely regarded as one of the foundational figures of reggae toasting, influencing generations of Jamaican deejays and even early American hip-hop artists.
