## Biography
Johnny 'Guitar' Watson, born John Watson Jr. on February 3, 1935, in Houston, Texas, was a pioneering American blues, soul, and funk musician whose career spanned over four decades[1][2][3][4][5][7]. Raised in a musical family—his father was a pianist and his grandfather a preacher-guitarist—Watson was initially taught piano but quickly gravitated toward the electric guitar, inspired by Texas blues legends like T-Bone Walker and Clarence 'Gatemouth' Brown[1][3][5]. After his parents separated in 1950, Watson moved with his mother to Los Angeles, where he immersed himself in the vibrant West Coast music scene, performing in juke joints and recording his first tracks as 'Young John Watson' at just 17[2][3][5].

Watson's early recordings in the 1950s and 1960s showcased his hard-hitting guitar style and versatility as a vocalist and pianist[2][5]. His flamboyant stage presence, colorful outfits, and innovative use of guitar feedback set him apart from his peers[4]. In the 1970s, Watson reinvented himself with a funk-infused sound, achieving commercial success with hits like 'Ain't That a Bitch,' 'Superman Lover,' and 'A Real Mother For Ya'[1][2][3]. His ability to adapt his blues roots to contemporary styles made him a significant influence on the development of funk and later hip-hop[2].

Watson's legacy is marked by his genre-blending artistry and impact on generations of musicians. He was inducted into the Blues Foundation Hall of Fame in 2008, and his innovative guitar techniques and showmanship have inspired artists across blues, rock, funk, and hip-hop[2][4][5]. Watson died of a heart attack while on tour in Japan in 1996, leaving behind a rich musical heritage that continues to resonate.
