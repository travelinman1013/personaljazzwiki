## Biography
Rich Pulin, an accomplished trombonist, composer, and arranger, was born and raised in Bethpage, Long Island, New York. He began his musical journey on the baritone horn before switching to trombone, inspired by the film 'The Glenn Miller Story.' As a teenager, Pulin quickly became active in the local music scene, performing at school dances and community events. His early break came at age 18, when he was introduced to legendary trumpeter Dalton Smith, who connected him to Woody Herman’s pianist-arranger Nat Pierce. This led to a pivotal audition and a position with the Tommy Dorsey Band under Warren Covington, marking the start of a prolific career in big band and jazz music.[1][6][7]

Throughout his career, Pulin held the first trombone and jazz soloist chairs with numerous renowned bands, including those led by Johnny Long, Richard Maltby, Buddy Morrow, Les & Larry Elgart, Les Brown, Tony Pastor, the Jimmy Dorsey Band under Lee Castle, and Woody Herman’s Herd. He also performed with the Al Grey/Billy Mitchell Sextet, Slam Stewart's Band, the Dave Pike Set, and notably, Clark Terry’s first big band at the Half Note. After returning to Los Angeles, Pulin worked with Glen Campbell’s band, The Supremes, and performed at the Monterey Jazz Festival with Ray Charles and Tito Puente. In addition to his performing career, Pulin has focused on music education, particularly early childhood jazz education, and continues to compose and collaborate with his family.[1][2][3][7]

Pulin’s musical style is rooted in the jazz and big band traditions, characterized by expressive trombone solos and sophisticated arrangements. His legacy is marked not only by his extensive performance history but also by his dedication to nurturing young musicians and promoting jazz education through initiatives like his 'Pulin for Jazz' program.[3][7]
