## Biography
Bo Dollis Jr., born and raised in New Orleans, Louisiana, is an award-winning performer, musician, and cultural educator who serves as Big Chief of the Wild Magnolias, a renowned Mardi Gras Indian tribe. Immersed in the Mardi Gras Indian tradition from an early age, Dollis Jr. began 'masking'—the ceremonial practice of donning elaborate beaded and feathered costumes—at just ten years old, following in the footsteps of his father, Bo Dollis Sr., a legendary figure who pioneered the Mardi Gras Indian funk sound. Dollis Jr.'s formative years were shaped by the vibrant musical and cultural heritage of New Orleans, and he quickly became a fixture in the city's music scene, making his first appearance with the Wild Magnolias at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival as a pre-teen[1][2][4].

After the passing of his father in 2015, Dollis Jr. assumed leadership of the Wild Magnolias, officially becoming Big Chief. He has continued to evolve the group's sound, merging traditional Mardi Gras Indian rhythms with elements of funk, jazz, blues, soul, and even zydeco and reggae. His albums, including 'A New Kind of Funk' (2013) and 'My Name is Bo' (2021), showcase both traditional chants and contemporary amplified styles, reflecting his commitment to honoring the past while innovating for the future[1][4][5]. Dollis Jr. and the Wild Magnolias have performed internationally, from Australia and Japan to England and Jamaica, and have graced prestigious stages such as the Summer Olympics and the White House. Their work has been recognized with awards, including the Jazz Award at the Ascona Jazz Festival in 2023[1].

Dollis Jr.'s legacy lies in his dedication to preserving and promoting the Mardi Gras Indian tradition, serving as a bridge between generations of New Orleans musicians and cultural bearers. His leadership and creative vision have ensured that the Wild Magnolias remain at the forefront of both local and global celebrations of New Orleans' unique musical heritage[1][2][4].
