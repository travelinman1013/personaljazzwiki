## Biography
The search results reveal multiple musicians named Jimmy Anderson, making a single comprehensive biography impossible without clarification. The most prominent figure in blues music is Jimmy Anderson, a harmonica player and vocalist born on November 21, 1934, on a farm near Natchez, Mississippi, to sharecropper parents. His early exposure to blues came through hearing harmonica player Alexander 'Papa George' Lightfoot, but his primary influence was Jimmy Reed, whose vocal and harmonica style Anderson emulated throughout his career. Anderson moved to Baton Rouge at age 16 and formed his first band, Jimmy Anderson & the Joy Jumpers, in 1959, performing in the swamp blues style of local artists like Slim Harpo and Silas Hogan.

Anderson's recording career spanned the early 1960s, with his first single released in 1962 on the Zynn label before being reissued nationally on Dot Records. He recorded multiple singles for the Nashville-based Excello label between 1962 and 1964, with songs like 'Naggin'' gaining unexpected popularity in the United Kingdom through Stateside Records compilations. Most of Anderson's recordings were his own compositions, demonstrating his songwriting abilities alongside his instrumental and vocal talents. In the mid-1960s, he transitioned to playing lead guitar after one of his band members departed, expanding his musical versatility. Anderson stepped away from professional music in 1969 when he moved back to Natchez and joined the police department, but he maintained a connection to music through deejaying at local R&B stations, earning the nickname 'Soul Man Lee' at WNAT in 1973.

Anderson's return to performing came in the early 1990s when Louisiana swamp-pop performer Johnnie Allen invited him to perform at the 1991 Blues Estafette festival in Utrecht, Holland. Despite not performing professionally for over twenty years, Anderson successfully relearned his material and received strong reception from European audiences. He subsequently toured Europe multiple times and recorded with Austria's Mojo Blues Band, with performances appearing on their 1999 CD 'Blues Parade.' Though Anderson suffered a stroke in 1999 that largely disabled his right arm, he continued performing harmonica and singing occasionally in the Natchez area.
