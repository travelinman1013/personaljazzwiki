## Biography
Alois Maxwell "Al" Hirt was born on November 7, 1922, in New Orleans, Louisiana, to a police officer father and a musically inclined mother. He received his first trumpet at age six and quickly gained recognition as a child prodigy, performing publicly by age sixteen. Hirt's formal musical education began at Jesuit High School and continued at the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music, where he studied classical trumpet and developed the technical virtuosity that would define his career[1][3][4].

After serving as a bugler in the U.S. Army Air Force during World War II, Hirt launched his professional career performing with major swing bands, including those led by Benny Goodman, Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey, Ina Ray Hutton, and Elliot Lawrence. Returning to New Orleans, he became a central figure in the city's jazz and Dixieland scene, leading his own bands and collaborating with local musicians. Hirt's recording career flourished in the 1950s and 1960s, producing more than 35 albums and several Top 40 hits, notably "Java," "Sugar Lips," and "Cotton Candy." His technical prowess and crowd-pleasing style earned him twenty-one Grammy nominations and a Grammy win for "Java" in 1964[1][3][4].

Hirt's legacy is deeply entwined with the cultural fabric of New Orleans, where he operated a popular nightclub on Bourbon Street and was affectionately known as "Jumbo." He performed for six U.S. presidents, hosted his own television show "Fanfare," and headlined the halftime show at the first Super Bowl in 1967. Hirt's blend of classical discipline, jazz improvisation, and popular appeal made him one of the most successful instrumental recording artists of his era, leaving a lasting influence on generations of musicians[1][3][4].
