## Biography
Reuben Wilson was born on April 9, 1935, in Mounds, Oklahoma, and relocated to Pasadena, California at age five, where he was surrounded by music and developed an early passion for performance.[1][2] Before dedicating himself to music, Wilson was a professional boxer as a teenager, but in 1962 he began playing organ and started performing in and around Los Angeles.[2][4] He moved to New York to launch his recording career, and in 1968 released his debut album *On Broadway* for Blue Note Records, marking the beginning of an influential period that would establish him as a pioneering figure in soul jazz.[1][4]

Throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s, Wilson recorded five albums for Blue Note Records, including *Love Bug* (1969) and the critically acclaimed *Blue Mode* (1970), during which he demonstrated a unique command of funk that helped redefine the soul jazz movement.[2][4] Unlike his contemporaries Jimmy Smith and Jimmy McGriff, Wilson incorporated a more accessible pop feeling into his Hammond B3 organ playing, influenced by the innovative drumming styles of Bernard Purdie and Idris Muhammad.[4] He continued recording for Groove Merchant and Chess/Cadet labels throughout the 1970s and 1980s, and his 1974 Cadet album track "Got to Get Your Own" became a surprise hit in English dance clubs during the 1980s.[1][4]

Wilson's legacy experienced a remarkable resurgence in the 1990s when his compositions and arrangements were sampled by influential hip-hop and acid jazz artists, including US3, A Tribe Called Quest, and Nas, introducing his music to new generations.[4][5] He received his first gold disc in 1997 for his compositions on US3's *Hand On The Torch* and toured extensively throughout Europe, Japan, and North America as part of Guru's Jazzmatazz II.[4] Remaining active into his late seventies, Wilson continued performing and teaching until developing dementia in his final years.[1] He passed away on May 26, 2023, at the age of 88 from lung cancer in New York City, leaving behind a profound influence on modern music that earned him "legend status" particularly in Europe.[1][4]
