## Biography
The Original Pinettes Brass Band, founded in 1991 at St. Mary's Academy in New Orleans, is celebrated as the world's first and only all-female brass band. Conceived by band director Jeffery C. Herbert, who was inspired to create a female counterpart to his own Original Pinstripe Brass Band, the group began with over a dozen young women, all students at the historically Black, all-girls Catholic school. Their early repertoire focused on New Orleans-style jazz, but they soon expanded into contemporary brass band music, performing at local events and parades, and quickly became a fixture in the city’s vibrant music scene.

Despite facing significant challenges—including frequent lineup changes and the upheaval caused by Hurricane Katrina—the Pinettes persevered. After the storm, bandleader Christie Jourdain revitalized the group, recruiting new members from across New Orleans. Their resilience and talent culminated in a major breakthrough in 2013, when they won the Red Bull 'Street Kings' competition, besting three male bands and prompting the event to be renamed 'Street Queens.' Since then, the Pinettes have released their debut album 'Finally,' performed at major festivals such as Jazz & Heritage Festival and Essence Music Festival, and toured internationally, all while challenging gender norms and inspiring future generations of musicians.

Musically, the Pinettes blend traditional New Orleans brass band sounds with funk, jazz, and contemporary influences, creating a dynamic and empowering style. Their legacy is not only defined by their musical achievements but also by their role as pioneers for women in a male-dominated genre, fostering a sense of sisterhood and breaking barriers for female musicians in New Orleans and beyond.
