## Biography
BADBADNOTGOOD is a Toronto-based instrumental jazz-funk trio consisting of Chester Hansen (bass), Alexander Sowinski (drums), and Leland Whitty (saxophone, Rhodes, guitar). The band has established itself as a genre-bending force in contemporary jazz, known for blending traditional jazz elements with experimental and electronic influences. Over their 15-year career, they have developed a reputation for pushing the boundaries of instrumental music and collaborating with diverse artists across multiple genres and continents.

Tim Bernardes is a São Paulo-based Brazilian musician, singer, and composer who has gained recognition as a Latin Grammy-nominated artist. He is known for his work as a singer-guitarist with the São Paulo band O Terno and has established himself as a talented vocalist and composer in the Brazilian music scene. The connection between BADBADNOTGOOD and Bernardes began when Bernardes opened the band's first Brazilian show in 2019, leading to a creative relationship that would culminate in their collaborative single.

The collaboration between BADBADNOTGOOD and Tim Bernardes represents a fusion of Canadian jazz-funk sensibilities with Brazilian musical traditions. Their partnership was solidified during BADBADNOTGOOD's residency at New York's Blue Note Jazz Club in 2024, where Bernardes joined them onstage and they debuted their collaborative single 'Poeira Cósmica' (Cosmic Dust). The track, co-written with Brazilian composer Arthur Verocai, showcases a lush, blissful sound that blends jazz instrumentation with poetic Brazilian vocals, representing a significant moment in both artists' careers.
