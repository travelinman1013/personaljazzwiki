## Biography
Johnny Hartman, born in Louisiana and raised in Chicago, was a baritone jazz singer celebrated for his velvety voice and masterful interpretation of ballads. After early work with orchestras and a handful of solo albums in the 1950s, Hartman’s career reached a pivotal moment in 1963 when he was invited by producer Bob Thiele to record with saxophonist John Coltrane. Though initially hesitant, Hartman was persuaded after hearing Coltrane’s quartet at Birdland, leading to their iconic collaboration. The resulting album, 'John Coltrane and Johnny Hartman,' recorded in March 1963 and released by Impulse! Records, became a landmark in vocal jazz, showcasing a seamless blend of Hartman’s lyrical phrasing and Coltrane’s expressive saxophone. This was the only album Coltrane ever recorded with a vocalist, and it revitalized Hartman’s career, earning critical acclaim and later induction into the Grammy Hall of Fame.[1][4][5]

Hartman’s style was characterized by his rich baritone, impeccable diction, and a storytelling approach to lyrics, which he described as making a song believable, almost like telling a story. Coltrane, already an established innovator in jazz, brought his classic quartet—McCoy Tyner, Jimmy Garrison, and Elvin Jones—to the session, creating a sensitive, elegant backdrop for Hartman’s vocals. The album’s success led Hartman to record several more albums for Impulse! and ABC, though he never achieved widespread fame. In the 1970s, Hartman performed in lounges and recorded sporadically, but his 1981 album 'Once in Every Life' earned him a Grammy nomination, affirming his enduring artistry. The collaboration with Coltrane remains a touchstone for vocal jazz, influencing generations of singers and musicians.[1][2][5]
