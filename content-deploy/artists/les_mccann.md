## Biography
Leslie Coleman McCann (September 23, 1935 – December 29, 2023) was an American jazz pianist, vocalist, and composer whose earthy blend of gospel, blues, and jazz helped define the sound of soul jazz in the 1960s and 1970s.[1][6] Born in Lexington, Kentucky, he grew up in a large musical family; his mother sang opera around the house and his father was an avid jazz fan, while he himself sang in church choirs and played tuba and drums in his school marching band.[1][6] Largely self‑taught at the piano—aside from a few childhood lessons—McCann deepened his musical education after joining the U.S. Navy in the mid‑1950s, where he was stationed in California, immersed himself in the San Francisco jazz scene, and won a talent contest that led to an appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1956.[1][2][6] After his discharge he remained on the West Coast, working as a doorman at the Blackhawk jazz club, then forming his own trio, Les McCann Ltd., and in 1960 began recording for Pacific Jazz, quickly gaining attention with albums such as *Les McCann Ltd. Plays the Truth* and *The Shout*.[1][3][6]

Through the 1960s McCann became a leading soul‑jazz figure, known for his robust left hand, funky, blues‑drenched lines, and a vocal delivery that drew on gospel fervor as much as jazz phrasing.[1][3][8] His international breakthrough came with *Swiss Movement* (1969), recorded live at the Montreux Jazz Festival with saxophonist Eddie Harris and trumpeter Benny Bailey; the opening track, Eugene McDaniels’ protest song “Compared to What,” with McCann singing and playing piano, became a million‑selling hit that crossed over to both pop and R&B charts and remains his signature performance.[1][2][3][6] After signing with Atlantic Records, he increasingly foregrounded his singing and pioneered the use of electronic keyboards—electric piano, clavinet, and early synthesizers—on albums such as *Layers* (1972), one of the earliest large‑scale electronic jazz projects.[2][3] Although a severe stroke in 1995 limited his piano technique, he continued to perform and record, leaning more on vocals while seeing his back catalog embraced by hip‑hop producers; by the 1990s, his grooves were being sampled hundreds of times, underscoring his lasting impact on later generations.[1][6]

McCann’s legacy rests on his role as a bridge between hard bop, gospel, R&B, and emerging funk, crafting a sound that was both accessible and harmonically sophisticated.[1][3] His recordings with Les McCann Ltd., his collaborations with Eddie Harris, and his adventurous electronic experiments on *Layers* and *Invitation to Openness* helped shape soul jazz and early jazz‑funk, while his commitment to groove and emotional directness made his work fertile ground for sampling by artists across hip‑hop and electronic music.[1][2][3] Inducted into the Kentucky Music Hall of Fame in 2008, he is remembered as a stylistic innovator whose deep swing, church‑influenced harmonies, and socially conscious repertoire—epitomized by “Compared to What”—secured him a place among the most influential jazz musicians of his era.[1][2][6]

## Fun Facts
- While serving in the U.S. Navy, Les McCann won a talent contest that earned him a performance on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1956, years before he became a recording star.[1][4][6]
- McCann famously turned down an opportunity—reportedly recommended by Miles Davis—to join Cannonball Adderley’s band because he preferred to lead his own group.[2]
- His 1973 album *Layers*, built around a single 27‑minute piece with 15 musicians and extensive use of electric keyboards, is considered one of the earliest large‑scale electronic jazz albums.[2][3]
- According to sampling databases, McCann’s records have been sampled more than 300 times, making his grooves a foundational resource for hip‑hop producers and DJs.[1]
