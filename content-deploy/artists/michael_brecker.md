## Biography
Michael Brecker (March 29, 1949 – January 13, 2007) was an American jazz saxophonist and composer, widely regarded as one of the most influential tenor saxophonists of his generation. Born in Philadelphia and raised in Cheltenham, Pennsylvania, Brecker grew up in a musically rich environment; his father was a jazz pianist and lawyer who exposed Michael and his brother Randy to jazz legends like Miles Davis and Duke Ellington from an early age. Michael began on clarinet, switched to alto saxophone, and ultimately settled on tenor saxophone in high school, inspired by the revolutionary playing of John Coltrane. After a brief period at Indiana University, he moved to New York City in 1969, quickly establishing himself as a dynamic soloist in the city's vibrant jazz and R&B scenes.

Brecker first gained national attention as a member of the jazz-rock band Dreams, which included his brother Randy and drummer Billy Cobham. He later joined Horace Silver's quintet before co-founding the Brecker Brothers, a seminal jazz-funk fusion group that achieved both critical and commercial success throughout the 1970s and early 1980s. Brecker's versatility made him one of the most sought-after session musicians, appearing on over 900 albums across jazz, pop, and rock genres. He was a founding member of the influential group Steps Ahead and collaborated with a host of legendary artists, including Herbie Hancock, Pat Metheny, and Joni Mitchell. His innovative harmonic language, technical mastery, and expressive improvisation left a profound mark on modern jazz.

Over his four-decade career, Brecker received 15 Grammy Awards and was posthumously inducted into the DownBeat Hall of Fame. His final album, 'Pilgrimage,' recorded while battling leukemia, featured an all-star lineup and won two Grammy Awards. Brecker's legacy endures through his recordings, his impact on generations of saxophonists, and his role in expanding the vocabulary of jazz fusion and contemporary improvisation.
