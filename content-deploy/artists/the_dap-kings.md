## Biography
The Dap-Kings are a Brooklyn-based soul and funk band best known as the longtime backing group and creative engine behind Sharon Jones & The Dap-Kings, one of the key acts in the late‑1990s and 2000s revival of classic 1960s–70s soul music. [2][4] Emerging around 2000 from the breakup of the earlier deep‑funk outfit the Soul Providers, bassist/producer Gabriel Roth (also known as Bosco Mann) and saxophonist Neal Sugarman pulled together a core lineup that included guitarist Binky Griptite, organist Earl Maxton, percussionist Fernando Velez, trumpeter Anda Szilagyi, tenor saxophonist Leon Michels, and drummer Homer Steinweiss, many of whom had already been active in New York’s underground funk scene. [2][4] Operating out of a modest Brooklyn basement studio, they became the house band for Roth’s newly founded Daptone Records, cutting raw, analog recordings that deliberately echoed the sonic character of vintage soul 45s. [2][4]

The group’s first major milestone came with the album “Dap Dippin’ with Sharon Jones & the Dap-Kings,” initially pressed in small quantities for a club residency in Barcelona and officially released in 2002 as Daptone Records’ debut LP, helping establish both the band and the label as standard-bearers for the retro-soul movement. [2][4][5] Subsequent albums such as “Naturally,” “100 Days, 100 Nights,” and “I Learned the Hard Way” deepened their reputation for tight, horn‑driven arrangements, in‑the‑pocket grooves, and live‑in‑the‑studio production that stood in contrast to contemporary digital R&B, while their relentless touring made them a formidable live unit. [2][5] Beyond their own records, the Dap-Kings became highly sought-after session players, contributing to high‑profile projects and cementing their status as one of the defining bands of the modern soul revival. [3][5][6]

Stylistically, the Dap-Kings draw heavily from late‑1960s and early‑1970s soul, funk, and R&B, channeling the influence of James Brown’s bands, Stax and Motown rhythm sections, and classic deep‑funk 45s through a contemporary but historically informed lens. [2][4] Their legacy is twofold: as the core of Sharon Jones & the Dap-Kings, they helped bring traditional soul music back into mainstream consciousness, and as a stand‑alone ensemble and session band, they provided the instrumental blueprint for many later retro‑soul and neo‑soul productions. [2][3][6] Even after Sharon Jones’s death in 2016, members of the Dap-Kings and the wider Daptone family have continued to carry forward that sound, influencing a generation of artists and producers who seek the warmth, immediacy, and emotional punch of classic analog soul. [2][3][6]

## Fun Facts
- The Dap-Kings grew out of the earlier band the Soul Providers after label founders and bandleaders split and Gabriel Roth went on to start Daptone Records, effectively rebooting the project under a new name and label identity. [2][4]
- Their debut album with Sharon Jones, “Dap Dippin’ with Sharon Jones & the Dap-Kings,” was first pressed in a small run mainly to sell during a residency at a club in Barcelona, Spain, before it became the flagship release for Daptone Records. [2][4]
- Daptone’s Brooklyn studio, where the Dap-Kings recorded, was outfitted with a sixteen‑track analog tape machine and built specifically to capture a raw, vintage sound, making it a sought‑after location for artists chasing classic soul tones. [2][4][5]
- Sharon Jones & The Dap-Kings’ album “Give the People What They Want,” powered instrumentally by the Dap-Kings, earned a Grammy nomination for Best R&B Album, signaling mainstream recognition for their traditionally rooted soul approach. [5]

(Influence heard across albums such as “Naturally,” “100 Days, 100 Nights,” and “I Learned the Hard Way.”) [Referenced across the band’s catalog from the early 2000s onward]
