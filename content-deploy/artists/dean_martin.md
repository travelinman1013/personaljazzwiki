## Biography
Dean Martin, born Dino Paul Crocetti on June 7, 1917, in Steubenville, Ohio, was the son of Italian immigrants and grew up speaking only Italian until age five. Dropping out of high school in the tenth grade, Martin worked a series of odd jobs—including as a steel mill worker, gas station attendant, and casino croupier—before pursuing a singing career in local nightclubs. His early musical influences included crooners like Harry Mills and Perry Como, and he began performing under the name 'Dino Martini' before Cleveland bandleader Sammy Watkins suggested the stage name Dean Martin.

Martin's career took off after he teamed up with comedian Jerry Lewis in 1946, forming one of the most successful comedy duos of the era. Together, they starred in 16 films and numerous television specials before splitting in 1956. Martin then established himself as a solo star, joining Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr., and others in the legendary Rat Pack, performing in Las Vegas and starring in films such as 'Rio Bravo' and 'Ocean's 11.' As a singer, Martin became known for his smooth baritone voice and relaxed, charismatic style, recording hits like 'That's Amore,' 'Volare,' and the perennial holiday favorite 'Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!'

Nicknamed the 'King of Cool,' Martin's legacy endures through his contributions to music, film, and television. He hosted 'The Dean Martin Show' on NBC from 1965 to 1974, further cementing his image as a laid-back entertainer with effortless charm. His influence continues to be felt in the genres of swing, big band, and adult standards, and his recordings remain popular decades after his death on December 25, 1995.
