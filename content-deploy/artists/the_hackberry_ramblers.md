# The Hackberry Ramblers

## Quick Info

- **Spotify Popularity**: 4/100

- **Origin**: Hackberry, Louisiana, United States

## Biography
The Hackberry Ramblers are a pioneering Cajun and country band formed in **Hackberry, Louisiana** in 1933 by fiddler **Luderin Darbone** and multi‑instrumentalist **Edwin Duhon**.[2][3][6] Drawing their name from the small Gulf Coast marsh town where they met, the group emerged in an era when radio, records, and the oil boom were transforming rural southwest Louisiana.[2][3] Early on, Darbone—then taking violin lessons by correspondence from New York—and Duhon—teaching himself Cajun French songs on accordion and guitar—joined with guitarist Lennis Sonnier to play local dancehalls and live radio broadcasts from stations such as KFBL in Beaumont, Texas and outlets in Lake Charles.[2][3] By 1935 they were recording for RCA’s Bluebird label in New Orleans, eventually cutting more than eighty sides in five years, in both French and English, and becoming one of the most widely heard Cajun bands of the 1930s Gulf Coast dance‑hall circuit.[2]

Musically, the Hackberry Ramblers developed a hybrid style often described as **Cajun‑country**, blending traditional French‑language Cajun repertoire with western swing, early jazz, country, Gulf Coast dance music, and, later, elements of swamp‑pop and early rock and roll.[3][5][6] They listened closely to a local Black New Orleans‑style dance‑hall orchestra and incorporated jazz standards like “Eh Las Bas,” while also crafting defining Cajun recordings such as their influential 1936 version of “Jolie Blonde,” whose jazzy fiddle and mournful vocals helped cement its reputation as the “Cajun national anthem.”[3][5] The band became famed for high‑energy dance sets at halls like the Silver Star near Lake Charles, often playing multiple nights a week and engaging in “battles of the bands” with country and boogie‑woogie figures such as Moon Mullican and T. Texas Tyler.[3] Over subsequent decades the lineup shifted, but Darbone and Duhon remained the core, steering the group through semi‑retirement and revival periods; with the help of drummer and manager Ben Sandmel and producer Chris Strachwitz of Arhoolie Records, they re‑entered national and international roots‑music circuits from the late 1980s onward, culminating in a **Grammy nomination in 1998** for their album *Deep Water* and a **National Heritage Fellowship** from the U.S. National Endowment for the Arts in 2002, honors that underscored their status as one of America’s longest‑running working bands.[2][3][5]

The Hackberry Ramblers’ legacy lies not only in their longevity—from their 1933 founding until roughly 2005—but also in their role as early adopters of amplification and cross‑genre experimentation in Cajun music.[2][5][6] They were among the first groups in rural Louisiana to amplify their instruments electrically so they could be heard over large, noisy dance crowds, symbolizing their willingness to embrace new technology while preserving traditional tunes.[2] Their recordings for Bluebird and later Arhoolie, and their tireless touring across Louisiana and East Texas, helped popularize Cajun music well beyond its home region and influenced later generations of Cajun and roots musicians who saw in the Ramblers a model for fusing heritage repertoire with contemporary sounds while sustaining a band over many decades.[3][5][6]

## Fun Facts
- The Hackberry Ramblers were among the **first bands in rural Louisiana to use electric amplification** for their instruments, so dancers in large, noisy halls could hear them clearly—an innovation that set them apart from other Cajun bands of the 1930s.[2]
- Fiddler and co‑founder **Luderin Darbone initially learned violin through a New York correspondence course**, studying by mail while living in the tiny marsh town of Hackberry before starting the band.[3]
- Their 1936 recording of **“Jolie Blonde”**—featuring Darbone’s jazzy fiddle and Lennis Sonnier’s plaintive vocals—helped establish the song as the so‑called **“Cajun national anthem,”** even though it had been recorded earlier under other titles.[3][5]
- In 1998, after more than six decades together, the Hackberry Ramblers received their **first Grammy nomination** for the album *Deep Water* and even performed on **MTV**, making a late‑career leap into mainstream media while still wearing their trademark cowboy hats, string ties, and red suspenders.[2][3]
