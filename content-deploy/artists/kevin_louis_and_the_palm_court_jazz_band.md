# Kevin Louis & the Palm Court Jazz Band

## Biography
Kevin Louis is a New Orleans-based trumpeter renowned for his work in traditional jazz. A 1995 graduate of the New Orleans Center for Creative Arts (NOCCA), he earned a Bachelor of Music degree in Jazz Performance, laying the foundation for his career in the city's vibrant jazz scene.[3] As an accomplished trumpeter, he leads the Preservation All-Stars, an adjunct ensemble connected to the iconic Preservation Hall family, where he embodies the role of the trumpet as the 'traffic director' in New Orleans jazz—guiding the melody, form, and transitions of ensemble performances.[1][2][5]

Louis has developed his career through regular performances with the Palm Court Jazz Band, including residencies like the 'Friday Night Palm Court Band' at Palm Court venues, contributing to the preservation and lively presentation of classic jazz repertoire.[4] His musical style is deeply rooted in New Orleans jazz traditions, demonstrated through educational content where he breaks down structures like 'Bugle Boy March,' highlighting the trumpet's leadership in directing sections from marches to swinging improvisations.[5] These performances and teachings underscore his commitment to authentic ensemble dynamics, with the trumpet stating melodies that cue counterlines from clarinet and tailgating from trombone.[5]

While specific details on his legacy are emerging given his ongoing career, Louis's affiliations with Preservation Hall and educational outreach via the Preservation Hall Foundation position him as a key figure in sustaining New Orleans jazz traditions for new generations.[1][5]
