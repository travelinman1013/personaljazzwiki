## Biography
Mary Flower is an acclaimed American guitarist, singer, songwriter, and music educator known for her mastery of blues, ragtime, and country blues. Raised in Delphi, Indiana, Flower grew up in a musical family and began performing as a high schooler. Her passion for blues was ignited in the early 1970s after attending a concert by Delta blues legend Yank Rachell, which inspired her to pursue the genre more deeply[1].

In 1972, Flower moved to Denver, Colorado, where she established herself in the vibrant local music scene. She collaborated with artists such as Katy Moffatt and Pat Donohue, and co-founded the influential all-women band Mother Folkers[1][2][3]. Flower's reputation as a 'picker's picker' grew, highlighted by her top-three finishes at the National Fingerpicking Guitar Championship in 2000 and 2002, making her the only woman to achieve this distinction twice[1][2][6]. After three decades in Denver, she relocated to Portland, Oregon in 2004, where her career flourished with multiple releases on Yellow Dog Records and frequent performances in the U.S. and abroad[2][3][4].

Flower's musical style is distinguished by intricate Piedmont fingerpicking, lap-slide guitar, and a blend of rootsy acoustic blues that spans ragtime, swing, folk, and hot jazz[1][2][4][5]. She is celebrated not only for her artistry but also for her dedication to music education, having developed instructional DVDs, taught at festivals and camps, and hosted her own guitar camp, Blues in the Gorge[5]. Her legacy includes a vital contribution to American roots music and a lasting influence on the next generation of acoustic blues musicians.
