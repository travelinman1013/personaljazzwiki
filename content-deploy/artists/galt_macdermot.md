## Biography
Arthur Terence Galt MacDermot (December 18, 1928 – December 17, 2018) was a Canadian-American composer, pianist, and writer best known for his groundbreaking work in musical theater. Born in Montreal to a Canadian diplomat and teacher, MacDermot was immersed in music from an early age, encouraged by his piano-playing father. He attended Upper Canada College and Bishop’s University, later pursuing formal music studies at the University of Cape Town in South Africa, where he developed a deep appreciation for African music and rhythms.

MacDermot’s early career included composing for the satirical Canadian musical 'My Fur Lady' and winning a Grammy for his jazz composition 'African Waltz.' In 1964, he moved to New York, where a pivotal introduction to Gerome Ragni and James Rado led to the creation of 'Hair' (1967), a landmark rock musical that captured the spirit of the 1960s counterculture. MacDermot’s genre-blending style drew from jazz, funk, gospel, classical, and African influences, resulting in memorable melodies and rhythms that resonated across generations. He followed 'Hair' with other notable works, including 'Two Gentlemen of Verona' (1971), which won a Tony Award, as well as numerous film scores, ballets, and liturgical pieces.

MacDermot’s legacy extends beyond the stage; his music has been widely sampled by hip-hop artists, attesting to its enduring rhythmic appeal. Revered for his melodic inventiveness and soulful approach, MacDermot left a lasting mark on musical theater and popular music, influencing artists across genres and decades.
