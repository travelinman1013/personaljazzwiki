## Biography
R. Dean Taylor (Richard Dean Taylor, May 11, 1939 – January 7, 2022) was a Canadian singer, songwriter, and producer who became one of the few white artists to find success at Motown Records during the 1960s and 1970s. Born in Toronto, Ontario, Taylor began performing at local country showcases at age 12 before moving into rock & roll. He released his first single, 'At the High School Dance,' in 1960 and, after a brief stint in New York, was encouraged to audition for Motown in Detroit, where he was signed as both an artist and songwriter.

Taylor's early years at Motown were spent learning the craft of hit songwriting, often under the guidance of Motown's legendary producers. He became a member of the writing and production team 'The Clan,' co-writing major hits for Diana Ross & the Supremes, including the U.S. No. 1 'Love Child.' As a solo artist, Taylor found international success with 'Indiana Wants Me' in 1970, which became a No. 1 hit on the Cash Box chart in the U.S. and reached the Top 5 in both the U.K. and Canada. His music blended elements of northern soul, pop, and Motown's signature sound, often featuring imaginative arrangements and storytelling lyrics.

Though he never matched the chart-topping success of 'Indiana Wants Me' again, Taylor remained an influential figure, especially in the U.K. northern soul scene with tracks like 'Gotta See Jane' and 'There's a Ghost in My House.' He continued to write and produce for other artists, founded his own label, and left a legacy as one of Motown's most distinctive and underrated talents.
