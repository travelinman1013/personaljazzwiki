## Biography
Lizz Wright is an acclaimed American vocalist and songwriter whose artistry bridges jazz, gospel, soul, and folk traditions. Born in Hahira, Georgia, she was immersed in music from an early age, serving as the musical director of her father's church and developing her voice through gospel and call-and-response singing. Her formal studies included classical repertoire at Georgia State University and jazz and spirituals at The New School in New York, further broadening her musical foundation[4][1].

Wright's national breakthrough came at age 22 as a featured vocalist in a touring tribute to Billie Holiday, which led to her signing with Verve Records at 23. Her 2003 debut album, 'Salt', topped Billboard’s contemporary jazz charts and established her as a major new voice in American music. Subsequent albums such as 'Dreaming Wide Awake' (2005), 'The Orchard' (2008), and 'Fellowship' (2010) showcased her ability to blend genres and interpret the Great American Songbook, while 'Freedom & Surrender' (2016) and 'Grace' (2017) further cemented her reputation for soulful, genre-defying performances[1][2][3].

Wright is celebrated for her rich, dark alto—described by The New York Times as possessing qualities akin to 'barrel-aged bourbon or butter-soft leather'—and for her capacity to evoke deep emotion and connection. Her music is recognized for transcending social divides, offering messages of love, community, and healing. With a career spanning over two decades, she continues to influence the landscape of modern American vocal music, most recently launching her own label, Blues & Greens Records, and releasing her first live album, 'Holding Space', in 2022[6][1].
