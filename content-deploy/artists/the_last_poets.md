## Biography
The Last Poets are a pioneering African American spoken‑word and music collective that emerged from the Black nationalist currents of the late 1960s civil rights and Black Power movements in East Harlem, New York City.[1][2][3][4] Founded on May 19, 1968—Malcolm X’s birthday—at Harlem’s Mount Morris (now Marcus Garvey) Park, the original trio of Abiodun Oyewole (born Charles Davis), David Nelson (Dahveed Ben Israel), and Gylan Kain sought to create a new Black nationalist poetry that confronted racism, poverty, police brutality, and systemic oppression with uncompromising candor.[3][4][5][6][7][8] Their name was inspired by South African poet Keorapetse Kgositsile (also cited as Little Willie Kgostile), who declared his was the “last age of poets” before guns would replace words as the primary instrument of struggle, a sentiment that fit the group’s revolutionary ethos.[3][5] Performing initially as street poets with conga drummer Nilaja Obabi in Harlem and on the influential television program “Soul!,” they quickly expanded into a collective that included Felipe Luciano, Jalal Mansur Nuriddin (also known as Alafia Pudim), Umar Bin Hassan, Suliaman El‑Hadi, and percussionists Nilaja Obabi and Baba Don, among others.[1][2][3][4][5][6]

Internal disagreements and political pressures led The Last Poets to split into overlapping line‑ups, both using the same name, but their recorded output in the early 1970s defined a new aesthetic that directly foreshadowed hip‑hop and rap.[2][4] The group signed with jazz producer Alan Douglas, releasing their self‑titled debut album in 1970, which reached the U.S. Top Ten album charts and featured searing pieces like “White Man’s Got a God Complex” and “Niggas Are Scared of Revolution,” followed by the equally incendiary “This Is Madness” (1971).[1][2][5] Their style fused rhythmically chanted, often rhymed political verse—sometimes derived from Jalal’s prison‑honed “spiel,” an early form of rapping—with hand percussion and sparse musical backdrops, creating a sound that was both rooted in African diasporic traditions and radically contemporary.[1][2][5] Though their popularity waned in the late 1970s, they were embraced from the 1980s onward as “grandfathers” and foundational architects of hip‑hop culture, frequently cited by rappers and DJs who sampled their recordings and pointed to Jalal’s solo concept album “Hustler’s Convention” (1973) as a blueprint for narrative street rap.[2] Across decades of changing membership, The Last Poets have continued to perform and record, maintaining their commitment to socially conscious art and leaving a lasting legacy on spoken‑word, jazz‑poetry, and global hip‑hop.[1][2][3][5]

## Fun Facts
- The Last Poets officially formed on May 19, 1968 in Harlem’s Mount Morris (now Marcus Garvey) Park, deliberately choosing Malcolm X’s birthday as a symbolic founding date.[3][4][7]
- Their name comes from a concept attributed to South African revolutionary poet Keorapetse Kgositsile (also cited as Little Willie Kgostile), who said he lived in the last age of poets before guns would replace poetry, underscoring the group’s militant outlook.[3][5]
- The group’s 1970 self‑titled debut album, filled with uncompromising critiques of both white supremacy and Black complacency, reached the U.S. Top Ten album charts—an unusual achievement for a politically radical spoken‑word record.[1][2]
- Jalal Mansur Nuriddin’s solo album "Hustler’s Convention" (1973), closely associated with The Last Poets, is often singled out by later hip‑hop artists as a direct forerunner of rap concept albums and street‑level storytelling.[2]
