## Biography
Detroit Junior, born Emery Williams Jr. on October 26, 1931, in Haynes, Arkansas, was an American blues and Chicago blues pianist, singer, and songwriter known for his gritty, humorous, and streetwise style.[1][2][7][8] He grew up in the Arkansas Delta and later moved to Detroit, Michigan, where he began working professionally in the 1940s and 1950s, playing in local clubs and honing a robust piano style rooted in the classic Chicago and Memphis blues piano traditions.[7][8] His stage name "Detroit Junior" was coined for early recordings rather than any deep personal tie to the city, although he did spend time gigging there before relocating.[3] 

By the early 1950s and 1960s, Detroit Junior was working steadily in Chicago, where he became a respected figure on the South and West Side club circuits and recorded for labels including Bea & Baby, Fox, and later Alligator and Delmark.[1][4][7][8] He joined Howlin’ Wolf’s band in the early 1970s and remained Wolf’s pianist in his final band until Wolf’s death in 1976, touring internationally and backing one of the most powerful voices in electric blues.[3][4][7] As a bandleader and songwriter, Detroit Junior cut sides such as "Money Tree" and "Call My Job," tunes that were later covered by other Chicago blues artists.[4][8] His records for labels like Alligator and Earwig in the 1980s and 1990s — including albums such as *Turn Up The Heat* and *Blues On The Internet* — showcased his gruff, talk-singing vocals, rolling left hand, and witty, observational lyrics about everyday urban life.[3][4][8]

Detroit Junior’s musical style drew heavily on the lineage of Chicago piano greats such as Eddie Boyd, Big Maceo Merriweather, and Little Brother Montgomery, blending boogie-woogie drive with a conversational, often comedic lyrical approach.[3][7][8] Critics and fellow musicians viewed him as an important link between the classic postwar Chicago piano tradition and later generations, keeping the style alive in neighborhood clubs long after many of his peers had passed or left the scene.[7][8] He remained an energetic live performer into his seventies, known for standing up from the bench to shout punchlines and engage the crowd, even as health problems mounted.[4][5] Detroit Junior died in Chicago on August 9, 2005, of heart failure, leaving a legacy as one of the city’s most colorful and enduring blues pianists, a bridge between the golden age of Chicago blues and the modern scene.[1][5][6][8]

## Fun Facts
- Despite his stage name, Detroit Junior’s nickname did not come from a deep personal association with Detroit; it was coined by someone who needed a catchy label name for one of his early recordings.[3]
- He was known on the Chicago scene as the irrepressible, small-statured man behind a battered piano, frequently standing up from the bench to shout punchlines and engage audiences with his earthy humor.[4]
- Detroit Junior’s song "Call My Job" became something of a modern Chicago blues standard, covered by other local blues artists and helping cement his reputation as a clever songwriter.[4][8]
- Even in his seventies, Detroit Junior continued to perform regularly in Chicago clubs, maintaining a lively stage presence and strong piano technique right up until shortly before his death in 2005.[4][5][6]

## Musical Connections

### Mentors/Influences
- [[eddie_boyd|Eddie Boyd]] - Older Chicago blues pianist who tutored Detroit Junior in piano and strongly shaped his approach; Detroit’s playing was noted for closely approximating Boyd’s style, itself rooted in Memphis and Chicago blues piano traditions. (Influence heard on Detroit Junior’s later recordings, including his Delmark album *Blues On The Internet*, where critics remarked how closely his touch and phrasing recalled Boyd.) [Instruction and influence primarily in the 1950s–1960s, with stylistic impact lasting throughout Detroit Junior’s career.[3]]
- [[big_maceo_merriweather|Big Maceo Merriweather]] - Seminal Chicago blues pianist whose rolling left hand and strong boogie-woogie feel formed part of the stylistic lineage that Detroit Junior carried forward. (Influence evident in Detroit Junior’s driving, left-hand patterns and traditional twelve-bar blues pieces recorded across his career.) [Indirect stylistic influence from Big Maceo’s 1940s recordings, shaping Detroit Junior’s playing as he developed in the 1940s–1950s.[3][7][8]]
- [[little_brother_montgomery|Little Brother Montgomery]] - Another key prewar and postwar blues and boogie-woogie pianist whose work formed part of the tradition that Detroit Junior embodied as a “living link” to the older Chicago piano style. (Reflected broadly in Detroit Junior’s mixture of barrelhouse, boogie, and lyrical blues piano on his club work and later albums.) [Indirect stylistic influence from Montgomery’s long recording and performing career, particularly on Detroit Junior’s mature style in Chicago.[3][7][8]]

### Key Collaborators
- [[howlin_wolf|Howlin’ Wolf]] - Detroit Junior served as pianist in Howlin’ Wolf’s last band, touring and recording live with him and providing the piano backbone to Wolf’s late-career performances. (Live recordings from Wolf’s European tours in the 1970s, documented on various concert releases, plus extensive unissued club work.[3][4][7]) [Early 1970s until Howlin’ Wolf’s death in 1976.[3][4][7]]
- [[lurrie_bell|Lurrie Bell]] - Chicago blues guitarist who appeared as a featured guitarist on Detroit Junior’s Delmark album sessions, contributing modern electric blues leads alongside Detroit’s piano. (Track "Weak Spot" and other cuts on the album *Blues On The Internet* (Delmark), where Bell’s guitar interacts with Detroit Junior’s piano.[3]) [Recorded collaboration on Delmark sessions in the late 1990s–early 2000s.[3]]
- [[jimmy_dawkins|Jimmy Dawkins]] - Respected Chicago blues guitarist who guested on Detroit Junior’s recordings, adding fiery lead guitar to his band arrangements. (Track "Money Crazy" and other performances on *Blues On The Internet*, where Dawkins is singled out for a prominent guitar solo.[3]) [Recorded collaboration on Delmark sessions in the late 1990s–early 2000s.[3]]
- [[maurice_john_vaughn|Maurice John Vaughn]] - Chicago guitarist, saxophonist, and bandleader who played guitar on multiple tracks of *Blues On The Internet*, helping shape the album’s mix of straight blues and more modern flavors. (At least seven of the fifteen performances on *Blues On The Internet*, including "Somebody Better Do Something," feature Vaughn’s guitar solos.[3]) [Recorded collaboration on Delmark sessions in the late 1990s–early 2000s.[3]]
- [[sonny_cohn|Sonny Cohn]] - Veteran trumpeter best known for his work with Count Basie; he appeared as a horn soloist on Detroit Junior’s Delmark recordings, bringing a jazz-inflected brass sound to the arrangements. (Trumpet solos on selected tracks from *Blues On The Internet*, where he is featured as part of the horn section and as a soloist.[3]) [Recorded collaboration on Delmark sessions in the late 1990s–early 2000s.[3]]

### Artists Influenced
- [[later-generation_chicago_blues_pianists_various|Later-generation Chicago blues pianists (various)]] - Detroit Junior was widely described as an important or “living” link to the Chicago blues piano tradition of the 1940s and 1950s, providing a direct stylistic model for younger pianists who heard him nightly in Chicago clubs. (Influence expressed through his local performances and recordings on labels such as Alligator, Earwig, and Delmark, which documented the classic Chicago piano style for newer musicians.[4][7][8]) [Primarily from the 1970s through the early 2000s, as he became an elder statesman of the Chicago scene.[4][7][8]]
