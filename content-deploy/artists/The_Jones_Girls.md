## Biography
The Jones Girls, comprising sisters Shirley, Valorie, and Brenda Jones, were born in Detroit, Michigan, to a family deeply rooted in gospel music. Their mother, Mary Frazier Jones, was a gospel singer, and the sisters began harmonizing at a young age. They started their career as backing vocalists for prominent artists like Aretha Franklin, Lou Rawls, and Diana Ross.

This marked the beginning of their successful run with hits like 'You Gonna Make Me Love Somebody Else' and 'I Just Love the Man.' Their music blended Motown flavors with Philly soul, creating a unique sound that resonated with audiences in the late 1970s and early 1980s. After their time at Philadelphia International, Shirley Jones pursued a solo career, achieving success with the hit 'Do You Get Enough Love.' Valorie passed away in 2001, and Brenda in 2017.
