## Biography
Mint Condition is an American R&B band from the Twin Cities of St. Paul–Minneapolis, Minnesota, that emerged from the vibrant late‑1970s and 1980s local scene shaped by Prince, The Time, and producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis.[2][3] The core members—vocalist/drummer Stokley Williams, guitarist Homer O’Dell, keyboardists Lawrence (Larry) Waddell and Keri Lewis, keyboardist/saxophonist Jeffrey (Jeff) Allen, and bassist Ricky Kinchen—met as teenagers in the performing arts program at Central High School in St. Paul and began playing together in various combinations before formally becoming Mint Condition in the late 1980s.[1][2][3] Their eclectic musicianship drew on jazz, funk, rock, hip hop, and traditional soul, and a 1989 performance at the legendary First Avenue club led to their discovery and signing by Jam and Lewis to Perspective Records.[1][2][3]

The band’s debut album *Meant to Be Mint* (1991) introduced them to national audiences, but it was the slow‑burn hit ballad “Breakin’ My Heart (Pretty Brown Eyes)”—which reached the R&B Top 5 and Pop Top 10—that established Mint Condition as major figures in early‑1990s R&B.[1][2] They followed with *From the Mint Factory* (1993), yielding the Top 2 R&B hit “U Send Me Swingin’” and additional Top 30 singles “Someone to Love” and “So Fine,” and then *Definition of a Band* (1996), whose single “What Kind of Man Would I Be?” went to #2 on the R&B chart, crossed over to the Pop Top 20, and was certified gold.[1][2] After Perspective/A&M folded, Mint Condition moved to Elektra and released *Life’s Aquarium* (1999), scoring another Top 5 R&B hit with “If You Love Me.”[1][2] In the 2000s they reinvented themselves on their own Caged Bird Records imprint with *Livin’ the Luxury Brown* (2005), which debuted at #1 on the Independent Album chart, followed by the live album *Live from the 9:30 Club* (2006) and *E-Life* (2008), whose single “Nothing Left to Say” returned them to the R&B Top 30 and Urban AC Top 5.[1][2]

Musically, Mint Condition became known as one of the last prominent self‑contained R&B/funk bands to chart before programmed tracks, hip hop, and new jack swing came to dominate Black radio in the 1990s.[2] Their ability to move fluidly between quiet‑storm ballads, new jack‑influenced grooves, jazz changes, rock‑tinged guitar work, and even Latin and Jamaican‑styled rhythms, combined with virtuosic live performance, earned them a reputation as a “musician’s band.”[1][2] The group has received a Grammy nomination and multiple Soul Train Award nominations, and their continued touring and recording into the 21st century helped keep the full‑band R&B tradition alive for a new generation of artists who cite their sophisticated songwriting and arrangements as a model.[2][3]

## Fun Facts
- The members of Mint Condition first came together through the performing arts program at Central High School in St. Paul, the same school that Prince and other notable Twin Cities musicians had ties to in the broader local scene.[3][6]
- Their big‑break performance that led to being signed was a live gig at Minneapolis’ famed First Avenue club—the same venue closely associated with Prince—where Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis saw them in 1989 and offered them a deal with Perspective Records.[1][2][3]
- Mint Condition has been described as one of the last major self‑contained funk/R&B bands to consistently chart before hip hop and programmed new jack swing production became dominant on Black radio in the 1990s.[2]
- After years on major labels, the band launched its own imprint, Caged Bird Records, and scored a #1 Independent Albums chart debut with *Livin’ the Luxury Brown* in 2005, demonstrating their ability to succeed as an independent act.[1][2]
