## Biography
The Rude Boys are an R&B group formed by Larry Marcus (a cousin of B.B. King), Melvin Sephus, Edward 'Buddy' Banks, and Joe Little III, discovered by Gerald Levert in the late 1980s. Levert, son of O'Jays lead singer Eddie Levert and a prominent singer-songwriter-producer himself (born July 13, 1966, died November 10, 2006), signed them to Atlantic Records, launching their career with the 1990 debut album *Rude Awakening*. This release featured new jack swing and quiet storm hits like 'Written All Over Your Face' (#1 R&B, #16 Pop), 'Heaven' (top 10 R&B), and 'Are You Lonely for Me' (#1 R&B), with the album peaking at #11 on the Billboard R&B chart.[1][3]

Their follow-up *Rude House* (1992) included 'My Kinda Girl' (#2 R&B underground hit) and 'Go Ahead & Cry,' selling under 250,000 units. Joe Little pursued a solo career with *Puttin' It Down* (1994, over 250,000 sold), and the group released *Rude As Ever* (1997) with Dwight Thompson replacing Little. After lineup changes, including Thompson's brief stint replacing Levert in LeVert, the original members reunited for Levert's funeral performance. The trio of Little, Banks, and Sephus continued, adding Thompson back before his later exit, while Marcus shifted to gospel.[1][3]

Gerald Levert's mentorship shaped the Rude Boys' smooth R&B sound blending new jack swing energy with quiet storm ballads, reflecting his own style from LeVert, solo work like *Private Line* (1991 #1 R&B), and supergroup LSG. Their legacy endures through tours and planned albums, tied to Levert's production for acts like Men at Large.[1][2][3]
