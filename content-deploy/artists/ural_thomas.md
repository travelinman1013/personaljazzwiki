## Biography
Ural Thomas is an American soul and R&B singer from Portland, Oregon, whose career stretches back to the golden age of 1960s soul and has experienced a remarkable late-life revival. Born in Louisiana and raised in Portland after his family moved there in the 1940s, he first sang in church before forming neighborhood vocal groups, including the Streetcorner Singers in middle school and the doo-wop‑leaning Monterays in high school.[1][6] The Monterays performed in parks and schools and even saved enough money to record their own album, helping Thomas develop his distinctive voice, which local writers later described as balancing grit and grace. As his reputation grew, a friend helped him get to Los Angeles, where he signed with Uni Records (a Universal subsidiary), then moved to New York and became a regular opener at the Apollo Theater in Harlem, sharing bills with James Brown, Otis Redding and other 1960s soul legends.[1][2]

Despite this brush with mainstream success, Thomas became disillusioned with the music industry—disputes over rights, stylistic conflicts, and the "battle of the bands" atmosphere led him to retreat to Portland in the early 1970s.[1][2] He continued to work a variety of day jobs, including busboy, machinist, and seed sorter, while never abandoning music: at his North Portland home he hosted long‑running Sunday "open house" jam sessions where he fed neighborhood kids, offered them clothes, and played music with them, cultivating a community around soul and improvisation.[1][2] Decades later, one of those Sundays brought drummer and DJ Scott Magee to his door; recognizing Thomas as a "living legend," Magee assembled a nine‑piece backing band, and **Ural Thomas & The Pain** was born.[1][2] Since the 2010s, Thomas and The Pain have toured the West Coast and beyond, releasing original material such as the album *The Right Time*, whose modern production still evokes the feel of a lost mid‑1960s Atlantic soul record and cementing Thomas’s reputation as a late‑blooming, high‑energy elder statesman of classic soul.[2][3][5]

Musically, Thomas draws deeply on gospel roots, doo‑wop harmonies, and 1960s soul, channeling the era of James Brown and Otis Redding while insisting on his own voice and simplicity of groove.[1][2] His performances are noted for a buttery yet raw vocal tone, high‑energy dance moves, and an emphasis on positivity and community, traits that distinguish him within Portland’s scene and the broader soul revival movement.[1][4][5] Though his early singles and Apollo appearances never brought lasting national stardom, his later‑life recordings and relentless live shows have given him renewed critical attention as part of a broader reassessment of overlooked soul singers of his generation, placing him alongside peers like Sharon Jones and Charles Bradley as an emblem of endurance, generosity, and the enduring power of classic soul.[2][5]

## Fun Facts
- Thomas hosted weekly Sunday “open house” jam sessions in his North Portland home for decades, feeding kids, offering them Goodwill clothes he had cleaned, and turning his house into an unofficial community music school.[1][2]
- After his early career in New York and Los Angeles, Thomas returned to Portland and worked a series of non‑music jobs—including 15 years as a busboy at the Imperial Hotel, a machinist at the shipyards, and a seed sorter—while quietly continuing to make music on the side.[1]
- When his original home was bulldozed, Thomas personally rebuilt his house on the same lot using recycled and found materials, intentionally leaving ample space for musicians to rehearse and jam on Sundays.[1]
- Although he is a septuagenarian (and later described as pushing 80), journalists and bandmates frequently remark that Thomas looks and performs decades younger, maintaining high‑energy dance moves and an exuberant stage presence that continues to surprise new audiences.[1][2]

## Musical Connections

### Mentors/Influences
- [[church_and_gospel_tradition|Church and gospel tradition]] - Early musical foundation; Thomas began singing in church after his family moved to Portland, shaping his vocal style and sense of spiritual intensity. (Early gospel singing and choirs rather than specific recorded works.) [1940s–1950s]
- [[james_brown|James Brown]] - Major stylistic reference point; Thomas regularly opened shows for Brown at the Apollo Theater, absorbing the performance intensity and showmanship of 1960s soul. (Shared bills at the Apollo in the 1960s; Thomas later re‑performed his own 1967 track “Pain Is The Name Of Your Game” in that classic soul style.) [Mid‑1960s–early 1970s[1][2]]
- [[otis_redding|Otis Redding]] - Contemporary and indirect influence; Thomas opened for Redding at the Apollo, and although Redding was personally distant, his presence positioned Thomas within the same classic soul milieu. (Shared Apollo Theater bills; no documented studio collaborations.) [1960s[1][2]]

### Key Collaborators
- [[the_monterays|The Monterays]] - High‑school a cappella/doo‑wop group co‑founded by Thomas in Portland; an early vehicle for his songwriting and vocal arrangements. (Locally recorded Monterays material (self‑financed album) and street‑corner and school performances.) [Late 1950s–early 1960s[1][3]]
- [[scott_magee|Scott Magee]] - Drummer, DJ, and co‑writer who rediscovered Thomas via his Sunday jam sessions and helped form Ural Thomas & The Pain. (Co‑writing and co‑producing original material on albums such as *The Right Time*, and extensive touring with The Pain.) [Circa early 2010s–present[1][2]]
- [[ural_thomas_and_the_pain|Ural Thomas & The Pain]] - Nine‑piece soul and R&B backing band assembled by Scott Magee; together they developed a tight, harmony‑rich live show and new studio recordings. (Live performances of “Pain Is The Name Of Your Game” and other vintage material; original albums including *The Right Time* and subsequent releases.) [2010s–present[1][2][3][5]]
- [[uni_records_universal_subsidiary|Uni Records (Universal subsidiary)]] - Label that signed Thomas during his initial solo career, facilitating his recording and Apollo Theater exposure in the 1960s. (1960s singles including “Pain Is The Name Of Your Game” (1967) and other sides issued under his own name.) [Mid‑ to late 1960s[1][2]]

### Artists Influenced
- [[north_portland_neighborhood_musicians_and_youth|North Portland neighborhood musicians and youth]] - Thomas’s long‑running Sunday open‑house jams nurtured generations of local players and singers, providing food, clothing, mentorship, and informal musical training. (Uncredited participation in jam sessions that fed into Portland’s broader soul, funk, and R&B scenes rather than specific releases.) [Early 1960s–present[1][2]]
- [[members_of_ural_thomas_and_the_pain|Members of Ural Thomas & The Pain]] - Band members came from more formally trained backgrounds but have cited Thomas’s feel‑driven, groove‑first approach and positivity as central to the band’s sound. (Collaborative writing and performance on *The Right Time* and subsequent recordings, which channel Thomas’s vintage soul aesthetic through a modern lens.) [2010s–present[1][2][5]]
- [[pacific_northwest_soul_revival_scene|Pacific Northwest soul revival scene]] - Thomas’s rediscovery and late‑career success have highlighted overlooked regional soul history and inspired renewed interest in vintage‑style soul bands and reissue culture. (Appearances and releases on Portland‑based labels and venues, including work with Mississippi Records affiliates and Tender Loving Empire’s release of *The Right Time*.) [2010s–present[2][3][5]]
