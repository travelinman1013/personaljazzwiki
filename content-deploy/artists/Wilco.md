## Biography
Wilco is an American alternative rock band formed in Chicago, Illinois, in 1994 by Jeff Tweedy, John Stirratt, Ken Coomer, and Max Johnston, following the breakup of the influential alternative country group Uncle Tupelo[1][2][6]. The band’s name, derived from the CB radio term for 'will comply,' reflects a spirit of adaptability and openness that has defined their career[1][3]. Wilco’s early albums, such as *A.M.* (1995) and *Being There* (1996), blended country-rock roots with a growing experimental edge, but it was the addition of multi-instrumentalist Jay Bennett and the release of *Summerteeth* (1999) that marked a shift toward lush, orchestral pop and more introspective songwriting[1]. The band’s reputation for adventurousness was cemented by *Yankee Hotel Foxtrot* (2002), a critically acclaimed album that overcame label rejection to become their most commercially successful release[1]. Over the years, Wilco’s lineup has evolved, with Tweedy and Stirratt remaining the only constants, and the band has continued to explore new sonic territories while maintaining a loyal following through energetic live performances and a steady output of studio albums[1][2]. Wilco’s legacy lies in their ability to bridge the gap between Americana traditions and indie rock innovation, influencing a generation of musicians and earning a place as one of the most respected bands in alternative music[1][3].

## Fun Facts
- Wilco’s name comes from the CB radio abbreviation for 'will comply,' a nod to the band’s Midwestern roots and their early days touring in a van[1][3].
- The band famously streamed their album *Yankee Hotel Foxtrot* for free on their website after being dropped by their label, a move that helped build their fanbase and is now seen as a precursor to the digital music era[1].
- Wilco’s album titles often reference radio communication: *A.M.* (their debut) and *Yankee Hotel Foxtrot* (named after the NATO phonetic alphabet)[3].
- Jeff Tweedy has a self-deprecating sense of humor about the band’s name, joking that 'rock and roll is in many ways the antithesis of compliance'[3].
