## Biography
The Wild Tchoupitoulas were a groundbreaking Mardi Gras Indian group formed in the early 1970s in New Orleans, Louisiana, by George 'Big Chief Jolly' Landry. Drawing on his Choctaw heritage and deep roots in the city's Mardi Gras Indian tradition, Landry assembled a tribe that celebrated the unique culture of New Orleans through music, elaborate costumes, and street performances. The group took its name from the Tchoupitoulas tribe, which also lent its name to a prominent New Orleans street.

In 1976, The Wild Tchoupitoulas released their self-titled album, a landmark recording that blended traditional Mardi Gras Indian 'call-and-response' chants with the funk rhythms of the Meters and the harmonies of Landry's nephews, the Neville Brothers. Produced by Allen Toussaint, the album was not a commercial hit but received critical acclaim for its authentic representation of New Orleans culture and its innovative fusion of musical styles. The collaboration on this album inspired the Neville Brothers to form their own group, which would go on to become one of the most influential acts in New Orleans music history. The Wild Tchoupitoulas' legacy endures as a vital link between the Mardi Gras Indian tradition and the broader evolution of funk and R&B in America.
