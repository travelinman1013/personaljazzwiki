## Biography
Gerald Beckett is a contemporary jazz flutist, bandleader, and composer born and raised in Beaumont, Texas.[7] He began his musical journey at age 11 playing alto saxophone before transitioning to the flute, and received eight years of classical training at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music.[3] As a freshman at the University of North Texas in Denton, Beckett continued developing his craft in one of the nation's premier jazz programs. He has established himself as a stalwart of the San Francisco music scene, where he leads the Gerald Beckett Quintet and performs regularly at jazz venues throughout the Bay Area.[3]

Beckett is recognized as a renaissance figure in contemporary jazz, known for his fierce, uninhibited passion and virtuosity on the flute.[4] His compositional work reflects an eclectic musical appetite, with challenging and memorable pieces that showcase his command of both his instrument and the jazz idiom.[2][4] Throughout his career, he has released several albums including "Oblivion" (2017) on Summit Records and "Mood," which continued the artistic trajectory established by his earlier work.[5] His contributions to the jazz community extend beyond performance and composition to include mentorship and leadership through his quintet.
