## Biography
NESTA, DaVionne is a Queens, New York-born Jamaican-American artist who grew up immersed in Caribbean musical traditions and Rastafarian culture. Born to Jamaican parents in Jamaica, Queens, NESTA (formerly known as Zan) developed a distinctive musical identity that blends contemporary R&B with reggae and dancehall influences. His father was the lead singer of the reggae band The Visionaries, providing him with direct exposure to professional musicianship and roots reggae from an early age. This familial connection to reggae heritage deeply influenced his artistic direction and sonic palette.

NESTA's musical style represents a modern fusion of soulful R&B vocals with Caribbean rhythmic elements, creating what he describes as trap-infused R&B with reggae and dancehall vibes. His sound is characterized by melodic sensibility combined with contemporary production techniques, allowing him to appeal to diverse audiences across R&B and reggae genres. NESTA has articulated an ambitious artistic vision, stating his desire to become 'the Bob Marley of the trap-infused R&B game.' His recent work includes the album 'Hope It Gets Better' (2022) and singles such as 'True Self' (2023), 'For Granted' (2023), 'City of Angels' (2022), and 'Jah Knows' (2022), all of which showcase his ability to craft emotionally resonant music that bridges traditional and contemporary sounds.

Throughout his career, NESTA has performed at significant venues and festivals including the One Drop Reggae Festival, the Fillmore, House of Blues, and the Essence Music Festival in New Orleans. His performances demonstrate his evolution as a dynamic live artist capable of engaging diverse audiences. Despite his rising profile in the R&B and Contemporary R&B music scene, NESTA maintains relatively low mainstream popularity while building a dedicated following among listeners who appreciate his genre-blending approach and authentic connection to his Jamaican-American heritage.
