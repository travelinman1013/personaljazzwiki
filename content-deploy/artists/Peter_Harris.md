## Biography
Peter Harris is a British artist, filmmaker, and musician born in Portsmouth in 1967. He studied Fine Art and has built a multidisciplinary career that bridges visual art, film, and music, with a particular focus on experimental and collaborative projects. Harris is known for exploring identity and self-portraiture through innovative artistic processes, often inviting influential figures from his life to contribute to his work.

In the realm of music, Harris is most recognized for his deep association with dub, collaborating extensively with legendary Jamaican producer Lee 'Scratch' Perry from 2003 until Perry's passing. Their partnership spanned visual art, film, and music, resulting in a series of unique projects that merged Harris's experimental sensibilities with Perry's iconic dub style. Harris's musical output is characterized by a fusion of dub, experimental, and electronic elements, and his work often blurs the boundaries between audio and visual art. His collaborations have been featured in both gallery settings and music releases, contributing to the ongoing evolution of dub and experimental music.

Harris's legacy lies in his ability to cross artistic disciplines and cultures, fostering creative partnerships that challenge conventional boundaries. His work with Lee 'Scratch' Perry, in particular, has been celebrated for its originality and for bringing together the worlds of contemporary British art and classic Jamaican dub.
