## Biography
The Budos Band is an instrumental ensemble from Staten Island, New York, formed in 2005. The group originated from a core of musicians who met as youths in an after-school jazz ensemble at the Richmond Ave. Community Center, later bonding over a shared passion for soul music and late-night excursions to Manhattan clubs to hear acts like Antibalas and Sharon Jones & the Dap-Kings[2]. Their early sound was shaped by these experiences and by their fascination with East African music, particularly the 'Ethiopique' anthology, which led them to blend Afrobeat, soul, funk, and psychedelic influences into a unique style described as "doom rock Afro-soul" and "70's Psychedelic Instrumental Music"[1][3].

The band was initially known as Los Barbudos (Spanish for "the bearded ones") before adopting the name The Budos Band in 2005[2][3]. After impressing Daptone Records with their distinctive sound, they were signed and quickly recorded their debut album. Over the years, their lineup has included David Guy, Andrew Greene, Cochemea Gastelum, Jared Tankel, Dame Rodriguez, Vincent Balestrino, Thomas Brenneck, Robert Lombardo, Mike Deller, Daniel Foder, Brian Profilio, and John Carbonella Jr.[1]. The Budos Band has released seven studio albums, each evolving their sound by incorporating elements from jazz, funk, Afrobeat, hard rock, and proto-metal. Their raucous live shows and studio work have earned them critical acclaim and a devoted following[1][5].

Throughout their career, The Budos Band has been closely associated with the Daptone label and its roster, frequently collaborating with artists like Sharon Jones and Charles Bradley. Their legacy is marked by their role in the New York soul revival scene, their innovative fusion of genres, and their influence on contemporary instrumental music. Critics have praised them for bringing a "familiar vibe while standing defiantly unique," with their music often described as cinematic and menacing, yet deeply rooted in the traditions of Afro-soul and funk[1][3].
