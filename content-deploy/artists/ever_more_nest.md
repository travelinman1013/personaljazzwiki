# Ever More Nest

## Quick Info

- **Spotify Popularity**: 2/100

- **Origin**: New Orleans, Louisiana, United States

## Biography
Ever More Nest is the Americana project led by Kelcy Mae Wilburn, a songwriter originally from Shreveport, Louisiana, who found her musical home in New Orleans. Wilburn first gained recognition recording under the name Kelcy Mae, releasing two albums and two EPs that blended her background in poetry with folk and pop influences. After feeling she had reached a creative endpoint as Kelcy Mae, she reinvented herself and her music under the new moniker Ever More Nest, a name inspired by a line from a poem by Mary Ann Samyn that evoked a sense of expansiveness and belonging.

The band debuted with 'The Place That You Call Home' in 2018, an album that received critical acclaim, including a nomination for Best Alt-Country Album at the Independent Music Awards and a spot on Offbeat Magazine’s Top 50 Albums of 2018. Wilburn’s songwriting is marked by emotive, authentic vocals and honest, observational lyrics that explore themes of place, identity, and belonging. Ever More Nest’s sound is rooted in Americana, alt-country, and folk traditions, enriched by lush harmonies, expansive guitars, and elements of blues and gospel—reflecting both Wilburn’s North Louisiana upbringing and her poetic sensibilities.

Following the debut, Ever More Nest continued to build its legacy with the sophomore album 'Out Here Now,' recorded in Nashville with producer Neilson Hubbard and a cadre of accomplished musicians. The group has performed at notable venues and festivals across the United States, including the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival and the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, solidifying its reputation as a dynamic force in contemporary Americana.
