## Biography
King Oliver's Creole Jazz Band was formed in the early 1920s by cornet player Joseph "King" Oliver, who had migrated from New Orleans to Chicago in 1918. The ensemble debuted on June 17, 1922, at the Lincoln Gardens Café in Chicago, establishing itself as a pioneering force in jazz history. The band's lineup featured Oliver on cornet, Louis Armstrong on second cornet, Johnny Dodds on clarinet, Honore Dutrey on trombone, Lillian Hardin on piano, Bill Johnson on bass, and Warren "Baby" Dodds on drums—nearly all of whom were born in New Orleans, bringing authentic traditional jazz sensibilities to the Midwest.

The band achieved historic significance through their extensive recording sessions in 1923, when they recorded 37 performances across four different record labels (Gennett, Okeh, Columbia, and Paramount). These recordings, beginning on April 5-6, 1923, at Gennett Records in Richmond, Indiana, represented the first substantial body of recordings by African American musicians that were indisputably jazz and the first recordings of a working Black jazz band. Their innovative ensemble-based approach and Oliver's pioneering use of the "talking" horn technique elevated jazz from regional roots to national prominence, establishing the permanent standard for ensemble-oriented New Orleans jazz groups.

Despite early success, the band disbanded in 1924 due to financial disputes and internal conflicts. The departure of Louis Armstrong, whose talents had become unmatched within the group, marked a turning point. Oliver subsequently led King Oliver's Dixie Syncopators from 1925 to 1927 at Chicago's Plantation Café before moving to New York in 1927. Though Oliver's career declined during the Great Depression, his legacy remained profound, having influenced countless jazz musicians and established foundational principles that would shape swing music and modern jazz.

## Fun Facts
- King Oliver recruited Louis Armstrong to the band by wiring New Orleans for a second cornetist, not knowing that his former apprentice would become so talented that Armstrong's presence would eventually transform the band's sound and lead to his own departure to start a solo career.
- Oliver was suffering from a gum disease that would eventually end his music career, which was already beginning to affect his playing during the band's peak years at the Lincoln Gardens, making the recruitment of Armstrong's cornet skills even more critical.
- The Creole Jazz Band's 1923 recordings were the first extensive series of recordings by African American musicians that are indisputably jazz, and they surpassed the performances of the Original Dixieland Jazz Band and the New Orleans Rhythm Kings—making them the best jazz recordings in history up to that point.
- Oliver supposedly rejected a position at the Cotton Club in New York, which instead famously went to Duke Ellington, representing a significant missed opportunity during the height of the Harlem Renaissance.
