## Biography
The Upsetters were the influential studio band formed by legendary Jamaican producer Lee "Scratch" Perry in the late 1960s. Originally conceived as Perry's house band, The Upsetters became central to the development of reggae and dub, serving as the backbone for Perry's innovative productions at his Upsetter label and later at the iconic Black Ark studio. Their early work helped transition Jamaican music from ska and rocksteady into the heavier, syncopated rhythms that defined reggae, with hits like "People Funny Boy" and "Return of Django" establishing their reputation both in Jamaica and the UK.[2][5][6][8]

Throughout the 1970s, The Upsetters were Perry's primary collaborators, recording and performing with a rotating cast of talented Jamaican musicians. The band played a pivotal role in the creation of classic tracks for artists such as Bob Marley and the Wailers, Junior Murvin, Max Romeo, and The Congos, often blending experimental studio techniques with traditional reggae instrumentation. Their sound was marked by deep grooves, psychedelic effects, and an adventurous spirit that pushed the boundaries of Jamaican music.[1][2][8]

The Upsetters' legacy is profound: they not only helped define the sound of reggae and dub but also influenced generations of musicians worldwide. Their work with Perry laid the foundation for the international spread of reggae, and their experimental approach inspired artists in genres ranging from punk to electronic music. Today, The Upsetters are remembered as one of the most important and innovative bands in the history of Jamaican music.[1][3][8]
