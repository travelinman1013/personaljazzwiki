## Biography
The Carolina Chocolate Drops are a groundbreaking Black string band formed in 2005 in North Carolina by Rhiannon Giddens, Dom Flemons, and Justin Robinson. Inspired by the nearly forgotten tradition of African American string band music, the trio met at the first Black Banjo Gathering in Boone, North Carolina, and were originally known as Sankofa Strings. Their core repertoire was learned directly from Joe Thompson, an elder African American fiddler from Mebane, North Carolina, whose mentorship deeply shaped their sound and mission.[1][2][3][4]

The group quickly gained recognition for their energetic performances and dedication to reviving and reinterpreting old-time music, blending styles such as bluegrass, jug-band, early jazz, and Piedmont blues. Their debut album, 'Dona Got a Ramblin’ Mind,' was released in 2006, followed by several acclaimed records, including the Grammy-winning 'Genuine Negro Jig' (2010) and the Grammy-nominated 'Leaving Eden' (2012).[2][4] Over the years, the band’s lineup evolved, with members like Hubby Jenkins, Malcolm Parson, and Rowan Corbett joining as original members departed. The Carolina Chocolate Drops performed at major festivals, opened for legends like Bob Dylan and Taj Mahal, and made history as the first Black string band to play the Grand Ole Opry.[1][2]

Their legacy extends beyond their recordings and performances. The Carolina Chocolate Drops sparked a renewed interest in Black roots music, inspiring a new generation of musicians and scholars to explore the African American contributions to American folk and country music. They have been inducted into the North Carolina Music Hall of Fame and are featured in national museums, cementing their role as cultural ambassadors who reshaped the narrative of American roots music.[1][4]
