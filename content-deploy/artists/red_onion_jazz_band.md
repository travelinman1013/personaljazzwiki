## Biography
The Red Onion Jazz Band was a prominent traditional jazz ensemble formed in Melbourne, Australia, around 1960. Originally named the Gin Bottle Jazz Band, the group was inspired by the Yarra Yarra Jazz Band and led by drummer Allan Browne and trumpeter Brett Iggulden. The band's early lineup drew from the bayside suburbs of Melbourne and included musicians such as Kim Lynch (tea-chest bass), Bill Howard (trombone), Felix Blatt (banjo), and John Pike (piano). Their energetic performances and unique blend of humor and musicality quickly made them a fixture in the local jazz scene, with regular gigs at venues like the Oxford Jazz Club and their own Red Onion Jazz Club in Brighton.

The Red Onion Jazz Band gained national attention in the 1960s, releasing several well-received recordings on W&G Records and Swaggie Records. Their style was rooted in traditional New Orleans jazz, characterized by lively ensemble playing, spirited solos, and a sense of theatricality. The band underwent several lineup changes, with notable members including Gerry Humphrys (clarinet, vocals), Rainer Breit (banjo), and Ian Clyne (piano). In 1967, the group embarked on a 10-month European tour, further cementing their reputation as one of Australia's leading jazz bands. After a hiatus in the 1970s, the band reunited in the 1980s and continued to perform at festivals and special events until their final appearances in the 1990s and a brief reunion in 2008.

The Red Onion Jazz Band's legacy lies in their role as pioneers of the Australian jazz revival, influencing a generation of musicians and helping to establish Melbourne as a center for traditional jazz. Their alumni went on to form influential groups such as The Loved Ones, and their recordings remain highly regarded among jazz enthusiasts for their authenticity and exuberance.
