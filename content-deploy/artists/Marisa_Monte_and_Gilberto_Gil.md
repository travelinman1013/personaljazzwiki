## Biography
Marisa de Azevedo Monte, born on July 1, 1967, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, emerged as one of the most acclaimed Brazilian vocalists of the 1990s and beyond. Growing up in a musically nurturing environment with her father Carlos Monte, an economist and cultural director at the Portela samba school, she was immersed in Rio's samba tradition from an early age. At 14, she took the entrance exam for the National Music School with aspirations of becoming an opera singer, and at 19, she moved to Rome to study bel canto and further her operatic training.

Her time in Italy proved transformative, as performing Brazilian music in Italian nightclubs helped her gain new respect for the scope of Brazilian music and realize her true calling lay in contemporary popular music rather than opera. Returning to Brazil with a fresh perspective, Monte began researching music across all genres, from traditional Brazilian forms to the works of Kurt Weill and Marvin Gaye. With the help of journalist and producer Nelson Motta, she developed the theatrical performance 'Veludo Azul' (Blue Velvet) in 1987, which debuted at Rio's Jazzmania and quickly became a sensation, establishing her reputation before she even recorded an album.

Monte's subsequent career has been marked by fearless musical exploration and creative partnerships that established her as both a dominant commercial force and artistic innovator in Brazilian culture. Her studio albums 'Mais' (1991) and 'Verde, Anil, Amarelo, Cor de Rosa e Carvão' (1994) showcased her songwriting abilities and collaborations with experimental artists. The formation of Tribalistas in 2002 with Arnaldo Antunes and Carlinhos Brown resulted in a supergroup recording that sold over a million copies and found success internationally. Over three decades, Monte has created a body of work that rivals the golden era stars of Brazilian music, representing a culmination of the MPB tradition while continuously pushing artistic boundaries.

## Fun Facts
- She was offered a recording contract in 1983 at age 16 but chose to continue studying and performing instead
- Her theatrical performance 'Veludo Azul' was so successful that filmmaker Walter Salles directed a TV version of it
- She started a business making and selling jewelry and accessories before her music career took off
- In 2020, she received the prestigious Tenco Award for lifetime achievement in songwriting in Sanremo, Italy, with past recipients including Leonard Cohen
