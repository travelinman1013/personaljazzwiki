## Biography
The Black Keys are a Grammy-winning blues rock and garage rock duo from Akron, Ohio, formed in 2001 by childhood friends Dan Auerbach (vocals, guitar) and Patrick Carney (drums). Growing up just blocks apart, Auerbach and Carney bonded over a shared love of classic blues and rock, eventually dropping out of college together to pursue music full-time. Their early sound was characterized by raw, lo-fi recordings made in Carney's basement, with their debut album 'The Big Come Up' (2002) and its follow-up 'Thickfreakness' (2003) recorded on minimal equipment in just hours, reflecting their DIY ethos and deep blues influences.[1][2][4][7]

Over the next decade, The Black Keys steadily built a devoted following through relentless touring, frequent album releases, and a reputation for electrifying live performances. Their music evolved to incorporate elements of psychedelic rock and soul, reaching wider audiences with albums like 'Brothers' (2010) and 'El Camino' (2011), both of which garnered critical and commercial success. The duo is known for their gritty, blues-infused sound, often paying homage to Mississippi hill country blues, as seen on their 2021 album 'Delta Kream.' After a brief hiatus, they returned with new material, demonstrating a continued commitment to their roots and a willingness to experiment with new sonic directions.[1][2][3][4]

The Black Keys' legacy lies in their ability to bridge the gap between traditional blues and modern rock, revitalizing garage rock in the 2000s and inspiring a new generation of musicians. Their minimalist approach, refusal to rely on big studios, and authentic chemistry have made them one of the most influential rock acts of their era.[1][2][4]

## Fun Facts
- The band's name comes from a phrase used by a schizophrenic artist in Akron who described people he didn't trust as 'black keys.'[1][4]
- Their second album, 'Thickfreakness,' was recorded in just 14 hours in Patrick Carney's basement using an old Tascam 8-track recorder, and some tracks include background noises like an owl hooting.[4]
- The Black Keys took a four-year hiatus from 2015 to 2019 to focus on side projects before reuniting for 'Let's Rock.'[1]
- They are known for licensing their songs extensively for commercials, TV, and movies, which helped them gain widespread recognition early in their career.[2]
