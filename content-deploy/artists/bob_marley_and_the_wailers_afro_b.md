## Biography
Bob Marley & The Wailers were a pioneering Jamaican reggae band formed in 1963 by Bob Marley, Peter Tosh, and Bunny Wailer in Kingston, Jamaica. Marley, born Robert Nesta Marley in Nine Mile, Jamaica, began his musical journey as a teenager, initially forming a group called The Teenagers, which evolved into The Wailers. The group’s early sound was rooted in ska and rocksteady, but they soon became synonymous with reggae, a genre they helped define and popularize worldwide. Their music was deeply influenced by Marley's conversion to Rastafari in the late 1960s, which shaped both their lyrical themes and visual identity, including Marley's iconic dreadlocks.

The Wailers achieved international fame after signing with Island Records in the early 1970s, releasing landmark albums such as 'Catch a Fire' and 'Rastaman Vibration.' After Tosh and Bunny Wailer departed in 1974, Marley continued with a new lineup, including the I-Threes (featuring Rita Marley), and produced globally influential albums like 'Exodus' and 'Uprising.' Marley's songwriting blended messages of social justice, unity, and spirituality, making him a symbol of peace and resistance. His legacy endures as one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century, with The Wailers' music continuing to inspire generations worldwide.
