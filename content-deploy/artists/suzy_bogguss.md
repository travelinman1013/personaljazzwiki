## Biography
Susan Kay Bogguss, born December 30, 1956, in Aledo, Illinois, is an acclaimed American country music singer and songwriter whose career spans over four decades. Encouraged by her parents, Bogguss began singing in her church choir at age five and learned to play piano and drums as a child. She later picked up the guitar and performed in musicals during her high school years. After graduating from Illinois State University with a degree in metalsmithing, she launched her career as a performing musician, playing in local coffeehouses and clubs. In 1985, she moved to Nashville, working as a demo singer and performing at Dollywood before signing with Capitol Records in 1987. Her debut album, 'Somewhere Between,' released in 1989, blended traditional and contemporary country styles and earned critical acclaim. Bogguss rose to prominence in the 1990s with eight Top 10 hits, three gold-certified albums, and one platinum album. Her musical style is rooted in classic country, with influences from folk, jazz, and western swing, and she is known for her clear, luminous voice reminiscent of Emmylou Harris. Bogguss has maintained a strong connection with her fans through regular performances, livestreams, and community events, and she will be inducted into the Grand Ole Opry in 2025, cementing her legacy as a living legend of country music.
