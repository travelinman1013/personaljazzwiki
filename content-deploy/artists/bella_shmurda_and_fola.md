## Quick Info
- **Genres**: afro adura, afrobeats, afrobeat, afropop, alté
- **Spotify Popularity**: 68/100

- **Origin**: Ikorodu, Lagos State, Nigeria (Bella Shmurda’s origin) / Ibadan, Oyo State, Nigeria (Fola’s origin, later active in Lagos)

## Biography
“Bella Shmurda & Fola” is not a single artistic persona but rather the pairing of two Nigerian artists: **Bella Shmurda** (Abiola Ahmed Akinbiyi), a leading Lagos-born afrobeats singer–songwriter, and **Fola**, a newer Nigerian vocalist signed under Bella Shmurda’s Dagbana/Dangbana Republik imprint.[3][4][5] Bella Shmurda grew up in a large polygamous family in Ikorodu, Lagos State, where he joined his elementary school band and cultural dance troupe, later completing secondary school in Badagry and earning a degree in History and International Relations from Lagos State University.[3] He broke out nationally in 2019 with the street anthem “Vision 2020,” whose viral reception and remix with Olamide transformed him into a prominent afrobeats and street-pop voice and led to the launch of his creative collective and label, Dangbana Republik.[2][3]  

Fola’s story traces a more recent rise: raised in Ibadan and later active in Lagos, he began making music in high school with a small band and juggled odd jobs, including working at his father’s betting shop, to support his artistic ambitions.[1] His early releases such as “Miss You,” “Money Chaser,” “Feeling,” and “Ginger Me,” along with underground favorites like “Alone” (and its BNXN remix) and “Mandela (Effect),” helped him gain traction in Nigeria’s alt-leaning afro-fusion scene.[4][5][1] In October 2024, Bella Shmurda announced Fola’s signing to Dagbana/Dangbana Republik, describing him as more than just a business partner but family and a younger brother figure, cementing a mentor–protégé relationship that now anchors their joint branding and collaborations.[4][1]  

Musically, Bella Shmurda is rooted in afrobeats and street-pop but often blends afrobeat, afro soul, and Fuji inflections with emotive, socially conscious storytelling, a style that has earned him awards recognition across Africa and a role as a key voice of Lagos street culture.[2][3] Fola works in a similar Afro-fusion lane, drawing from afrobeats, soulful melodies, and streets-inspired narratives, with critics noting the cathartic, introspective tone of his project “Catharsis” and his ability to balance prophetic, motivational themes with club-ready production.[1][5] Together under the Dagbana/Dangbana Republik umbrella, “Bella Shmurda & Fola” represent a generational bridge: Bella as the established hitmaker and collective leader, and Fola as the label’s breakout new-school act whose growing catalog and high-profile collaborations signal his emerging legacy in contemporary Nigerian music.[3][4][5]
