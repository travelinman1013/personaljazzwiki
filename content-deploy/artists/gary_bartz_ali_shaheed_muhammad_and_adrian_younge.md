## Biography
Gary Bartz is an acclaimed alto saxophonist whose career spans over six decades, marked by a deep commitment to jazz innovation and social consciousness. Born in Baltimore, Maryland, to nightclub-owning parents, Bartz was exposed to jazz legends from an early age and was inspired by the sound of Charlie Parker at just six years old. He began playing alto saxophone at age 11 and later attended the Juilliard School in New York City. Bartz quickly established himself as a leading figure in jazz, performing with icons such as Max Roach, Charles Mingus, Art Blakey, and Miles Davis. His work with the Ntu Troop in the 1970s fused hard bop with soul and political themes, reflecting his belief that music should speak to freedom and social justice.

Adrian Younge and Ali Shaheed Muhammad are contemporary producers and musicians known for their work in hip hop and jazz fusion. Younge, a multi-instrumentalist and composer, and Muhammad, a founding member of A Tribe Called Quest, have collaborated extensively since the 2010s, notably producing the soundtrack for the Marvel series *Luke Cage* and launching the Jazz Is Dead series in 2020. Their collaboration with Gary Bartz on the album *JID006* exemplifies their mission to bridge generations of jazz musicians, providing legendary artists with the resources to create new music while introducing them to younger audiences. The trio’s work blends classic jazz with psychedelic and funk elements, resulting in a sound that is both timeless and contemporary.
