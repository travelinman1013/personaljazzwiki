## Biography
Marc Broussard was born on January 14, 1982, in Lafayette, Louisiana, where he was immersed in one of the most culturally rich musical environments in the United States. His father, a Louisiana Hall of Fame guitarist with the legendary band The Boogie Kings, nurtured Marc's musical gifts from an early age. Growing up in the vibrant Lafayette music scene, Broussard had the opportunity to practice his craft consistently from childhood through early adulthood, absorbing the deep traditions of Louisiana's French and Spanish heritage that predates the founding of the country. This foundation shaped his distinctive "Bayou Soul" style, a sophisticated blend of funk, blues, R&B, rock, and pop that would become his signature sound.

After releasing a successful independent EP at age 20, Broussard signed a record deal with Island Records, which marked the beginning of his national prominence. His breakthrough came with the hit single "Home," which achieved significant radio success and catapulted him onto the national touring stage. Over the next 14 years, he released multiple albums with major labels, but found the creative restrictions and lengthy lag times between recording and release frustrating. In pursuit of greater artistic freedom and prolific output, Broussard returned to his independent roots and began releasing both original and cover records at a more rapid pace.

Beyond his musical achievements, Broussard has become equally recognized for his humanitarian work. In 2015, he established the SOS Foundation (Save Our Soul), dedicating 50% of profits from his cover albums to charitable causes, particularly organizations addressing homelessness and poverty. His commitment to giving back has earned him recognition including the Hard Rock International "Love All, Serve All" Award in 2007. Today, Broussard continues to tour extensively—spending six to eight months annually on the road—while maintaining his philosophy of using his platform and advantages to provide opportunities for those less fortunate, all while remaining prolific in his musical output with plans to release multiple projects annually.

## Fun Facts
- Chad Gilmore, Marc's drummer of 15 years, almost turned down the gig due to a massive blackout on the eastern seaboard that prevented him from calling to decline. A live recording of Marc's band arrived at his house the next day, and after his then-girlfriend (now wife) convinced him not to turn it down, he became Marc's longest-serving band member. The two have performed thousands of shows together without ever having a serious argument.
- Marc was originally a self-described "soul snob" who rejected other genres and was unfamiliar with the catalogs of major rock bands like The Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin. Over the past five years, he has deliberately broadened his musical horizons and now embraces rock and roll and other genres he previously rejected.
- Marc donated all proceeds from a bootleg recording to benefit victims of Hurricane Katrina, undertook a month-long tour of U.S. military installations in September 2007, and has worked with Habitat for Humanity, demonstrating his commitment to humanitarian causes throughout his career.
- After spending 14 years restricted by major label contracts, Marc strategically created the SOS Foundation to allow him to release music more frequently. His current goal is to be as prolific as possible, releasing original records interspersed with charity-focused cover albums, allowing him to put out more music than ever before in his career.
