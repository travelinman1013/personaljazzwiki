## Biography
Willie Lee Perryman, known professionally as Piano Red and later as Dr. Feelgood, was born on October 19, 1911, on a farm near Hampton, Georgia, to sharecropper parents Ada and Henry Perryman[2][4]. An albino African American, Perryman and his older brother Rufus (who performed as Speckled Red) both developed careers as blues pianists despite poor vision caused by their albinism. Neither brother received formal music lessons; instead, they learned by ear after their mother bought a piano for them, and Willie cited Fats Waller and local blues pianists as early influences[2][4]. By his late teens, Perryman was performing blues, rags, and popular songs at camp meetings, fish fries, juke joints, and theaters throughout the South, gradually morphing his style from traditional blues to the emerging rhythm and blues sound[1][4].

Piano Red’s career breakthrough came in 1950 with the release of “Rocking With Red” and “Red’s Boogie,” both of which became national hits on the Billboard R&B charts—making him the first artist to score a pop chart hit in this genre[2][3][4]. His energetic, percussive barrelhouse piano style and cheerful shout made him a favorite in both Black and white venues during a time of musical and social transition in the American South. Over three decades, Perryman recorded for labels like RCA Victor and became a fixture in Atlanta’s music scene, later adopting the stage name Dr. Feelgood. Despite being less celebrated in the U.S. than in Europe, where he was admired by musicians like Paul McCartney, Eric Clapton, and members of the Rolling Stones, Piano Red’s influence on the development of rock and roll is widely acknowledged, with some historians crediting his 1950 hit for popularizing the term “rock and roll” in Atlanta[1][2]. He continued performing into the 1980s, leaving behind a legacy as a master entertainer who never lost his love for live performance[1].
