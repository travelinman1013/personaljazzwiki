## Biography
Mark Sherman (born April 17, 1957, in New York City) is a renowned American jazz vibraphonist, pianist, drummer, composer, and educator, celebrated for his versatility across jazz, classical, and popular music. Raised in a musically rich environment—his mother Edith Gordon was a Juilliard-trained soprano—Sherman began classical piano studies as a child and later expanded to vibraphone and drums. He attended the High School of Music and Art and earned a degree in classical percussion from The Juilliard School, where he studied under legendary percussionists and developed a deep affinity for jazz.

Sherman's professional career began in his teens, performing with pianist Kenny Kirkland and later introducing Kirkland to Wynton Marsalis. By age 21, he was working in New York's vibrant studio and Broadway scenes, quickly becoming an in-demand session musician. Throughout the 1980s and beyond, Sherman collaborated with jazz luminaries such as Wynton Marsalis, Joe Lovano, Michael Brecker, Kenny Barron, and Larry Coryell, as well as pop icons like Michael Bolton and Natalie Cole. His discography as a bandleader and sideman is extensive, with notable albums including 'Fulcrum Point,' 'A New Balance,' 'The Motive Series,' and 'Live at Sweet Rhythm.'

Sherman is also a dedicated educator, serving on the faculties of The Juilliard School and New Jersey City University, and conducting masterclasses worldwide. He is known for his technical mastery of the vibraphone, innovative improvisational style, and ability to blend jazz with classical and world music influences. Sherman's legacy is further cemented by his work as a producer, author, and founder of Miles High Records, as well as his influence on a new generation of jazz musicians.
