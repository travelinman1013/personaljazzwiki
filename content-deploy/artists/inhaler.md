## Biography
Inhaler is an Irish alternative rock band formed in Dublin in 2012 by a group of school friends: Elijah Hewson (vocals, rhythm guitar), Josh Jenkinson (lead guitar), Robert Keating (bass), and Ryan McMahon (drums). The members met at St. Andrew’s College in Blackrock, Dublin, bonding over a shared passion for guitar-driven music at a time when such tastes were uncommon among their peers. Initially, they performed covers—most notably Nirvana’s 'Smells Like Teen Spirit'—before gradually developing their own sound and songwriting abilities[2][4].

The band’s name, 'Inhaler,' was inspired by Hewson’s childhood asthma, a nickname that stuck and became their moniker[1][2]. While Elijah Hewson is the son of Bono (U2’s lead singer), Inhaler has worked to establish its own identity, drawing from influences like The Stone Roses, The Killers, and The Strokes. Their debut single, 'I Want You,' was released in 2017, and after signing with Polydor in 2019, they began to gain international attention. Their first album, 'It Won’t Always Be Like This,' arrived in 2021 to critical acclaim, followed by 'Cuts & Bruises' in 2023, and their third album, 'Open Wide,' is anticipated in 2025[3][4].

Inhaler’s music is characterized by energetic guitar riffs, melodic hooks, and anthemic choruses, blending indie rock and post-punk revival elements. Despite early skepticism due to Hewson’s famous lineage, the band has built a dedicated following and is recognized as one of the most promising acts in contemporary rock, earning spots on major tours and festival lineups[1][4].
