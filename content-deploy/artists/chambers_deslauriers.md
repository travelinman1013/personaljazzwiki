## Biography
Chambers DesLauriers is a contemporary blues, soul, and blues‑rock band built around the personal and musical partnership of American singer Annika Chambers and Canadian guitarist–vocalist Paul DesLauriers.[1][2][3] The project crystallizes two already established careers: Chambers, a Houston-born soul‑blues vocalist who came up singing in church and honed her artistry after two tours of duty in the U.S. Army, and DesLauriers, a Cornwall, Ontario native who began performing professionally as a teenager and became one of Canada’s premier blues‑rock guitarists.[1][2][3] They first met at a music conference at the Orpheum Theatre in Memphis in 2018, reconnected a year later, and quickly moved from whirlwind romance to marriage, eventually formalizing their shared musical vision under the Chambers DesLauriers banner.[1][2]

As a band, Chambers DesLauriers draws deeply on electric and soul blues traditions, blending Chambers’ gospel‑inflected, powerhouse vocals with DesLauriers’ fiery yet lyrical guitar work and a tight touring rhythm section.[1][2][3] Their recordings, including the collaborative album “Good Trouble” and the later full‑band set “Our Time To Ride,” were largely tracked live off the floor to capture the immediacy of their stage sound, with producer Eric Corne helping shape a mix of deep blues roots, soulful R&B melodies, and riff‑driven rock.[1][2][3] Surrounding themselves with seasoned players such as bassist Gary Davenport and drummer Sly Coulombe, they have crafted a sound that emphasizes resilience, personal storytelling, and the chemistry of two artists who have weathered military service, international touring, and, in DesLauriers’ case, recovery from a traumatic brain injury in 2018.[1][2][3] Though still in the early chapters of their joint discography, the project extends Chambers’ Blues Music Award–winning legacy in soul blues and DesLauriers’ Maple Blues Award–decorated career, positioning Chambers DesLauriers as a modern blues act that bridges traditional forms with contemporary, emotionally direct songwriting.[1][2][3]

Individually, Chambers earned a 2015 Blues Music Award nomination for Best New Artist Album with her debut “Making My Mark,” followed by “Wild & Free” and “Kiss My Sass,” and has been recognized with multiple Blues Music Awards for Soul Blues Female Artist of the Year in 2019, 2022, and 2024, plus another nomination in 2025.[1][2][3] DesLauriers, after early work with Canadian acts such as Black Cat Bone and Dawn Tyler Watson, formed The Paul DesLauriers Band in 1997, releasing a self‑titled 2014 album that topped the Canadian Blues Chart and subsequent records like “Relentless,” while collecting at least six Maple Blues Awards and a runner‑up finish at the 2016 International Blues Challenge in Memphis.[1][2][3] Chambers DesLauriers thus represents not a debut, but a convergence—an ensemble where two well‑traveled artists fuse their personal histories and stylistic strengths into a cohesive, modern blues statement.

## Fun Facts
- Annika Chambers and Paul DesLauriers first met in 2018 in the packed lobby of the Orpheum Theatre in Memphis during a music conference; they locked eyes, then did not see each other again for a year, after which their reconnection quickly led to engagement and marriage.[1][2]
- Much of the basic tracking for the album “Our Time To Ride” was recorded live off the floor in Montreal to preserve the band’s onstage energy, with producer Eric Corne emphasizing a relaxed, performance‑first atmosphere.[1][2]
- During the “Our Time To Ride” sessions, Paul DesLauriers reportedly recorded most of his guitar solos in a single night, staying in what Annika described as a creative ‘zone’ while the team debated whether he needed a break.[2]
- In 2018, before fully launching Chambers DesLauriers, Paul DesLauriers survived a traumatic brain injury, an experience he says deepened his connection to music and affirmed the guitar as his anchor through recovery.[1][2]
