## Biography
Malevitus is a rock band formed in New Orleans, Louisiana, with lead singer Tiana Hux, also known as MC Sweet Tea, as its central figure and the only female member. The band's name, derived from Greek, roughly translates to 'bad life,' reflecting its intense, hard-hitting sound characterized by Hux's powerful vocals over electric bass, guitar, and drums, blending elements of rock, punk, and genres like mathcore, sludge metal, screamo, and grindcore. Tiana Hux, born in Houston, Texas, grew up in suburbia and was first inspired by MTV music videos, leading her to study at the Art Institute of San Francisco before transferring to the University of Texas at Austin.[1][2][3]

There, Hux met her professor and mentor Linda Montano, a pioneer in performance art, who shaped her multidisciplinary approach. After college, Hux moved to New Orleans, embracing hip-hop, dance, and performance, but was displaced by Hurricane Katrina, leading to stints in Los Angeles and Austin before returning to New Orleans, where she found her artistic home. Malevitus began performing in 2016, with Hux's dynamic vocals driving the band's heavy, rhythm-anchored sound, often opening with deep bass lines and incorporating punk-inspired urgency and variation.[1][2]

The band's music stands out for its genre fluidity, with Hux challenging gender norms in rap and rock as a white female rapper and performer. Malevitus has released music including the album 'Malevitus' on Houma Records and the track 'Rapscallion,' contributing to New Orleans' vibrant arts scene while Hux continues as a performance artist and educator.[1][2][5][6]
