## Biography
Grover Washington Jr. (December 12, 1943 – December 17, 1999) was an American saxophonist and composer who became one of the most popular and influential figures in soul jazz and smooth jazz.[2][3][5] Born in Buffalo, New York, to a mother who sang in church choirs and a father who collected jazz 78s and played saxophone, he received his first horn around age ten and was encouraged into music at home.[1][4][5] As a teenager he snuck into clubs to hear organ bands and saxophonists such as Jack McDuff, Harold Vick, and Charles Lloyd, and by about twelve he was already playing professionally in R&B and blues groups in Buffalo.[1][5] After stints with Midwestern groups including the Four Clefs and the Mark III Trio, he was drafted into the U.S. Army, where drummer Billy Cobham—his bandmate in the Army band—introduced him to key New York musicians and helped open doors for his post‑service freelance work in New York and Philadelphia.[1][2][3]

Washington settled in Philadelphia in the late 1960s, working extensively in soul‑jazz organ combos with leaders like Charles Earland and Johnny Hammond (Johnny Hammond Smith) and recording as a sideman for labels such as Prestige before getting his big break in 1971.[1][3][5] When saxophonist Hank Crawford missed a Creed Taylor–produced Kudu Records session, Washington was called in, resulting in his debut as a leader, *Inner City Blues* (1971), a crossover success that launched him as a major new voice on soprano, alto, and tenor saxophone.[1][3] Through the 1970s he refined a style that blended R&B backbeats, funk grooves, and lush arrangements with jazz improvisation on albums like *All the King’s Horses*, *Soul Box*, and especially *Mister Magic* (1974), which became a pop, soul, and R&B chart hit and made him a concert headliner.[1][3] His 1980 album *Winelight* marked the apex of his commercial and critical success: the record’s relaxed, polished sound and the hit single “Just the Two of Us” with Bill Withers helped define the emerging smooth jazz format, earned Grammy Awards for Best Jazz Fusion Performance and Best R&B Song, and achieved platinum sales.[1][2][3]

Over a career spanning work for Kudu, Motown, Elektra, and Columbia, Washington developed highly personal voices on soprano, alto, tenor, and occasional baritone sax, usually stretching more adventurously in concert than on his radio‑friendly studio sides.[1][3] He collaborated widely, appearing with artists ranging from Bob James and Dave Grusin to B.B. King, Herbie Hancock, Ron Carter, Marvin “Smitty” Smith, and vocalists such as Bill Withers, Jean Carne, and Jon Lucien, and he remained closely associated with Philadelphia’s music scene from the late 1960s onward.[1][3][4] Frequently cited alongside Wes Montgomery and George Benson as a founding figure of smooth jazz, Washington helped establish the template for jazz‑funk and contemporary jazz saxophone that would shape radio playlists and younger players for decades.[2][3][5] He continued performing at a high level into the 1990s—appearing, for example, at President Bill Clinton’s jazz and blues jam and 50th‑birthday celebration—before dying suddenly of a heart attack at age 56 after taping a television performance in New York, leaving a legacy as a virtuoso improviser who bridged jazz, R&B, and pop audiences.[4][5]

## Fun Facts
- As a teenager in Buffalo, Grover Washington Jr. would sneak into clubs to hear organ groups and saxophonists like Jack McDuff, Harold Vick, and Charles Lloyd, effectively getting his jazz education by eavesdropping from the back of the room.[1]
- Washington’s breakthrough as a leader came by accident: he was called to replace Hank Crawford, who could not make a Creed Taylor Kudu recording date, and the resulting session became his hit debut album *Inner City Blues*.[1][3]
- His landmark album *Winelight* not only yielded the hit “Just the Two of Us” with Bill Withers but also won two Grammy Awards—Best Jazz Fusion Performance for the album and Best R&B Song for the single—while achieving platinum sales.[1][2][4]
- In the 1990s he performed at a high‑profile jazz and blues jam with President Bill Clinton, Herbie Hancock, and Wynton Marsalis in 1993 and later played at Clinton’s 50th‑birthday celebration at Radio City Music Hall, reflecting his wide recognition beyond the jazz world.[4]

## Musical Connections

### Mentors/Influences
- [[grover_washington_sr|Grover Washington Sr.]] - Father; early teacher who introduced him to the saxophone and jazz records at home, giving him his first saxophone lessons and shaping his foundational sound and interests. (Early practice and local gigs rather than specific recordings.) [Early 1950s (childhood in Buffalo).]
- [[jack_mcduff|Jack McDuff]] - Organist whose club performances Washington watched as a youth; McDuff’s soul‑jazz organ band format and groove‑oriented approach influenced Washington’s later work with organ combos and his own jazz‑funk style.[1] (Influence reflected broadly in Washington’s early soul‑jazz recordings such as *Inner City Blues* and *Mister Magic*.[1][3]) [Mid‑to‑late 1950s (as a listener); aesthetic influence through the 1970s.]
- [[harold_vick|Harold Vick]] - Tenor saxophonist Washington listened to in Buffalo clubs; Vick’s robust, blues‑inflected soul‑jazz sound contributed to Washington’s concept of tenor sax tone and phrasing.[1] (Influence heard in Washington’s 1970s soul‑jazz tenor work on albums like *Soul Box* and *Mister Magic*.[1]) [Teen years in Buffalo (late 1950s), with stylistic influence into the 1970s.]
- [[charles_lloyd|Charles Lloyd]] - Saxophonist Washington snuck into clubs to hear; Lloyd’s blend of post‑bop and more open, melodic improvisation offered a model for combining accessible melodies with jazz freedom.[1] (General saxophone and improvisational influence evident in Washington’s lyrical soprano and alto work on *Winelight*.[1][3]) [Late 1950s–early 1960s as an aspirant listener; ongoing stylistic influence.]
- [[billy_cobham|Billy Cobham]] - Drummer colleague in the U.S. Army band who became a key connector; after service, Cobham introduced Washington to prominent New York musicians, helping launch his professional freelance career.[1][2] (Facilitated connections leading to early New York and Philadelphia sessions that preceded *Inner City Blues*.[1][3]) [Early–mid 1960s (Army years and immediate post‑Army period).]

[Late 1960s–early 1970s in Philadelphia and on recordings.]
- [[johnny_hammond_johnny_hammond_smith|Johnny Hammond (Johnny Hammond Smith)]] - Organist who featured Washington on the album *Breakout*; this successful collaboration showcased Washington’s emerging voice and helped lead to his Kudu contract as a leader.[1] (*Breakout* (recorded for Kudu/CTI), a best‑selling album that significantly raised Washington’s profile.[1]) [Early 1970s (around 1971–1972).]
- [[creed_taylor|Creed Taylor]] - Producer and head of CTI/Kudu who signed Washington as a leader after hearing him on Johnny Hammond’s *Breakout*; Taylor shaped the lush, orchestrated sound of Washington’s early crossover albums.[1][3] (Produced Washington’s early Kudu albums including *Inner City Blues*, *All the King’s Horses*, *Soul Box*, and *Mister Magic*.[1][3]) [Early–mid 1970s.]
- [[bob_james|Bob James]] - Keyboardist, arranger, and producer who worked with Washington in the 1970s as both collaborator and session partner, helping define the smooth, groove‑based fusion sound.[1] (Session work and arranged tracks on Washington’s Kudu/Elektra‑era recordings; also shared credits on various CTI‑related projects.[1][3]) [Mid‑1970s–early 1980s.]
- [[dave_grusin|Dave Grusin]] - Pianist, composer, and producer who used Washington as a guest soloist and collaborated on polished jazz‑fusion and film‑score‑adjacent projects.[1] (Guest appearances on Grusin‑related sessions and crossover jazz recordings (various CTI/GRP‑sphere projects).)

- [[tommy_flanagan_herbie_hancock_ron_carter_marvin_smitty_smith|Tommy Flanagan, Herbie Hancock, Ron Carter, Marvin "Smitty" Smith]] - Acclaimed jazz rhythm‑section players with whom Washington recorded in a more straight‑ahead setting, demonstrating his mainstream jazz chops beyond smooth jazz.[1] (Album *Then and Now* (1988), where Washington explored more traditional jazz forms with this quartet of jazz luminaries.[1]) [Late 1980s (recorded and released in 1988).]
- [[president_bill_clinton_herbie_hancock_wynton_marsalis_jam_setting|President Bill Clinton, Herbie Hancock, Wynton Marsalis (jam setting)]] - Washington performed in high‑profile jam sessions including a 1993 White House jazz and blues event and Clinton’s 50th birthday celebration, underscoring his stature in the broader jazz community.[4] (Live jam at the White House (1993) and performance at Clinton’s 50th birthday at Radio City Music Hall (1996).)
