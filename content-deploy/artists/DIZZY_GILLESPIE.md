## Biography
John Birks "Dizzy" Gillespie (October 21, 1917 – January 6, 1993) was an American jazz trumpeter, composer, bandleader, and educator, widely recognized as one of the most influential figures in jazz history. Born in Cheraw, South Carolina, Gillespie was introduced to music by his father, an amateur bandleader, and began playing trumpet at age 14 after a brief stint with the trombone. He received formal training at the Laurinburg Institute in North Carolina and started his professional career in the mid-1930s, performing with swing bands such as those led by Benny Carter and Teddy Hill. Gillespie's energetic personality and outlandish stage antics earned him the nickname "Dizzy" early in his career.

In the 1940s, Gillespie became a central architect of bebop, a revolutionary jazz style characterized by fast tempos, complex harmonies, and virtuosic improvisation. Alongside saxophonist Charlie Parker, he pushed jazz into new territory, recording seminal works like "Salt Peanuts," "Groovin' High," and "A Night in Tunisia." Gillespie's innovative approach also embraced Afro-Cuban rhythms, helping to pioneer Latin jazz through collaborations with musicians such as Chano Pozo. His signature bent trumpet, puffed cheeks, and playful showmanship made him an enduring icon, while his compositions became jazz standards.

Throughout his career, Gillespie led influential big bands, mentored countless musicians, and was recognized with numerous honors, including multiple Grammy Awards and the Kennedy Center Honors. His legacy endures not only through his recordings and compositions but also through the generations of jazz musicians he inspired and taught, solidifying his place as one of the greatest trumpeters and creative forces in jazz history.
