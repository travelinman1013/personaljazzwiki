## Biography
Vince Ector, a Philadelphia native from South Philadelphia, grew up immersed in music through his father's influence, attending performances by organ great Don Patterson at Dino's, which sparked his passion for jazz organ trios and funky rhythms[1]. Educated in music magnet high schools and later at the University of Pennsylvania, he also attended William Paterson University, honing his skills across jazz, R&B, funk, and more after starting seriously around age 19-20[1][6]. His early career involved versatile gigs in Philadelphia, including carrying his drums up three flights to play with Charles Earland at Morgan's, blending styles essential for survival in the local scene[1].

Relocating to New York around age 27-28 in the mid-1990s, Ector established himself as a drummer/composer, performing and recording internationally for over 30 years with jazz luminaries like Freddie Hubbard, Randy Weston, James Moody, Jimmy Heath, and Charles Earland[1][2][3]. Known for his rhythmic mastery in shuffles and grooves as Earland's longtime sideman, he also leads projects like the Organatomy Trio featuring Pat Bianchi, Paul Bollenback, and Justin Jones, as heard on live recordings from 2020[1]. His style reflects Philadelphia's genre-blending ethos, encompassing swing, Latin, funk, hip-hop, blues, and world music[1][2].

Currently based in the New York City area, Ector serves as a Lecturer of Jazz Percussion at Princeton University and founded Arts For Kids, Inc., as its executive director, promoting music education[3][4][5][8]. His legacy endures through performances, recordings, and mentorship, embodying a versatile, professional approach to drumming[2].
