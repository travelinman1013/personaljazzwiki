## Biography
Hattie Hart was born around 1900 in Memphis, Tennessee, USA, and emerged as a prominent figure in the Memphis blues scene during the 1920s and early 1930s. She became one of the best-known singers on Beale Street, the epicenter of Memphis blues culture, performing in local venues and gaining recognition for her powerful vocals in the Memphis blues and country blues styles. Active as a singer and songwriter from the 1920s through at least the 1930s, and documented as alive after 1946, Hart was celebrated not only for her music but also for hosting lively parties that drew the local music community.

Hart's career highlights include her recordings with the Memphis Jug Band, capturing the raw energy of jug band blues. On September 24, 1929, in Memphis, she recorded tracks such as 'Won't You Be Kind To Me?' and 'You Wouldn't, Would You, Papa?' which exemplify her style blending heartfelt lyrics with the rhythmic drive of country blues and ragtime influences. Though her commercial output was limited, her presence on Beale Street solidified her local legend status, contributing to the vibrant Memphis blues tradition before fading from prominence after the 1930s.

Hart's legacy endures as a key voice in early Memphis blues, representing the era's female performers who shaped the genre amid the jug band explosion. Her work with ensembles like the Memphis Jug Band highlights the collaborative spirit of the time, influencing the preservation of regional blues history through rare recordings.
