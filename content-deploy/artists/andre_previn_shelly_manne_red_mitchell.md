## Biography
André Previn and His Pals, Shelly Manne & Red Mitchell represents a collaborative jazz trio that emerged during the golden age of West Coast jazz in the late 1950s. André Previn (born 1929 in Berlin) was an extraordinarily versatile musician who studied piano as a child and moved to Paris in 1938 before eventually settling in Los Angeles, where he was recognized as a prodigy, recording jazz at age 15 and arranging scores for MGM while still in high school. After serving in the Army, where he studied conducting with Pierre Monteux, Previn emerged in the 1950s as a swinging bop pianist known for his sophisticated interpretations of Broadway show music. Shelly Manne, a leading figure of the West Coast school of jazz, and Red Mitchell, an accomplished bassist, joined Previn to form a trio that specialized in jazz arrangements of theatrical scores. During 1957-1960, this collaboration produced some of Previn's finest jazz recordings for Contemporary Records, including celebrated albums of *My Fair Lady*, *Pal Joey*, *Gigi*, and *West Side Story*. The trio's work on *West Side Story* in 1960 exemplified their approach: transforming Leonard Bernstein's jazz-infused score into fresh interpretations that showcased Previn's innate grasp of phrasing and syncopated rhythm, Manne's innovative drumming, and Mitchell's solid bass foundation. This collaboration helped establish the trend of jazz groups recording Broadway show scores, fundamentally influencing how jazz musicians approached theatrical material. Previn's career trajectory shifted dramatically in 1962 when he abandoned jazz to pursue classical music and conducting, eventually leading the Los Angeles Philharmonic, though he would return to jazz part-time beginning in 1989.

## Fun Facts
- The *My Fair Lady* album that Previn recorded with Shelly Manne was released under Manne's name rather than Previn's, much to Previn's regret, yet it became a hit record that launched the entire trend of jazz groups recording Broadway show scores.
- Previn was a child prodigy who began recording jazz at age 15 and was arranging film scores for MGM while still in high school in Los Angeles.
- On one recording session for a lush orchestral album, Previn improvised an entire string chart for a blues number on the spot to make up for the recording being a few minutes short, resulting in the hit 'Like Young'.
- Previn's career spanned three major musical genres—Hollywood film scores, jazz, and classical conducting—and he achieved significant success in all three, including winning four Academy Awards for his film music.
