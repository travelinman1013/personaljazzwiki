## Biography
Leo Cavalcanti, born in São Paulo in 1984, is a Brazilian singer, composer, multi-instrumentalist, and arranger. Raised in a musical family—his father is the renowned songwriter Péricles Cavalcanti—Leo was exposed to a rich tapestry of sounds from an early age, including flamenco, Michael Jackson, Jackson do Pandeiro, and the Beatles. By age 13, he was composing and performing, often joining his father on stage, and quickly developed his skills as a percussionist and songwriter.

His professional journey began as a percussionist with Palavra Cantada, a children's music group led by Paulo Tatit and Sandra Perez. At 16, Leo founded his first band, Xanduzinha, paying homage to Brazilian icons Jackson do Pandeiro and Luiz Gonzaga through performances in São Paulo's university forró circuit. His first recorded song, "Tudo Sendo Lindo," appeared on his father's 2004 album "Blues 55." Leo's solo career took off with performances at major cultural events such as Virada Cultural Paulista and SESC Pompeia's Prata da Casa. He won the top prize for best composer at the 2009 Festival da 3ª Semana da Canção Brasileira in São Luis do Paraitinga.

Leo Cavalcanti's discography includes the critically acclaimed albums "Religar" (2010) and "Despertador" (2014), which blend pop, rock, and Brazilian rhythms with introspective lyrics. His music is characterized by energetic Latin pop influences, soulful vocals, and a focus on themes of love, sorrow, and the human condition. Cavalcanti's innovative arrangements and genre-blending style have earned him recognition as a versatile and influential figure in contemporary Brazilian music.
