## Biography
John Rankin is a renowned New Orleans-based musician, performer, and educator, celebrated for his mastery of solo acoustic guitar, powerful harmonica playing, and versatile songwriting. Described as a New Orleans hybrid of Leo Kottke and Chet Atkins, his style expansively blends jazz, classical guitar, folk, blues, rhythm and blues, and the American songbook, infused with the city's distinctive feel and charm. He has been a featured performer at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival since 1981 and performs weekly at the Columns Hotel, often joined by guest musicians.[1][7]

Rankin's career spans performance, recording, and teaching. He has released several albums, including Guitar Gumbo (2002), voted among Louisiana's top CDs by Gambit and The Times-Picayune; Fess’ Mess (2005); Last in April First in May (2008); and The Classic Jazz Trio (2010), which he produced featuring clarinetists Tom Sancton and Tom Fischer. Awards include two Big Easy Awards for Best Folk Music (1992, 2002), Jazz All-Star by New Orleans Magazine (2007), and the 1985 American Finger-Style Guitar Festival win. He has taught guitar and songwriting for over 30 years at Loyola University New Orleans, Tulane, University of New Orleans, and Xavier University, earning a 2012 Lifetime Achievement Award in Music Education from Offbeat Magazine.[1]

Though best known as a soloist, Rankin collaborates with ensembles like the New Orleans Guitar Masters, NOLA String Kings, and The Classic Jazz Trio, reflecting his broad influence in New Orleans music circles. His commitment to both performance and education underscores his legacy as a scholar of six-string music and New Orleans traditions.[1]
