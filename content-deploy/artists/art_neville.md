## Biography
Art Neville, born in New Orleans in 1937, was the eldest of the famed Neville brothers and a foundational figure in the city’s musical history[4][1]. His early fascination with keyboards began at age three, and by high school he was leading The Hawketts, whose 1954 recording of 'Mardi Gras Mambo' became a perennial Carnival anthem[1][2][4]. After a stint in the Navy, Neville returned to music, releasing solo R&B hits like 'Cha Dooky Do' and 'All These Things,' and soon formed Art Neville and the Neville Sounds, which evolved into The Meters by 1965[1][4].

The Meters, with Neville on keyboards and vocals, pioneered the distinctive New Orleans funk sound, emphasizing groove and rhythm over melody[4]. As the house band for Allen Toussaint’s studio, they backed artists such as Dr. John, Paul McCartney, LaBelle, and Robert Palmer, while their own instrumental hits like 'Cissy Strut' and 'Hey Pocky A-Way' became funk standards[2][3][4]. After The Meters disbanded, Neville joined his brothers Cyril, Aaron, and Charles to form The Neville Brothers in 1978, blending funk, soul, R&B, and Mardi Gras Indian music. The group toured globally, released numerous acclaimed albums, and won a Grammy for 'Healing Chant' in 1989[2][1][4].

Neville’s musical style was rooted in New Orleans R&B, drawing from Afro-Caribbean rhythms and the city’s rich tradition of funk, soul, and jazz. His legacy endures through his recordings, the continued influence of The Meters and The Neville Brothers on genres like hip-hop and jam bands, and his role as an ambassador for New Orleans music. He received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2018 and passed away in 2019 at age 81[1][4][5].
