## Biography
Sonny Stitt (born Edward Stitt, February 2, 1924, Boston, Massachusetts) was a masterful American jazz saxophonist celebrated for his work in bebop and hard bop. Raised in a musical family in Saginaw, Michigan, Stitt began his musical journey on piano before switching to clarinet and then alto saxophone. His early career was shaped by encounters with jazz legends such as Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, and Billy Eckstine, and he quickly became known for his technical prowess and innovative improvisation. Stitt's style, while initially compared to Parker, evolved into a distinctive voice on alto, tenor, and baritone saxophones, and he was one of the few to experiment with the electric saxophone. Over his prolific career, he recorded more than one hundred albums, earning the nickname 'The Lone Wolf' for his relentless touring and devotion to jazz. Stitt passed away on July 22, 1982, in Washington, D.C., leaving a legacy that shaped the modern jazz saxophone sound.[1][5][7][9]

Paul Gonsalves (July 12, 1920, Brockton, Massachusetts – May 15, 1974, London, England) was a renowned American tenor saxophonist best known for his long association with Duke Ellington. Gonsalves grew up in New Bedford, Massachusetts, and began his career as a guitarist before switching to tenor saxophone. After serving in the Army during World War II, he played with Sabby Lewis, Count Basie, and briefly with Dizzy Gillespie. In 1950, Gonsalves joined the Duke Ellington Orchestra, where his bold, harmonically sophisticated style became a cornerstone of Ellington's sound. His legendary 27-chorus solo at the 1956 Newport Jazz Festival on 'Diminuendo and Crescendo in Blue' is credited with revitalizing Ellington's career and remains one of the most celebrated moments in jazz history. Gonsalves also collaborated widely as a leader and sideman, recording with artists such as Sonny Stitt, Nat Adderley, and Ray Charles.[3][4]

Stitt and Gonsalves crossed paths in the early 1960s, notably on the album 'Salt and Pepper' (1963, Impulse!), which showcased their complementary saxophone styles and mutual respect. Both artists were pivotal in the evolution of jazz saxophone, influencing generations of musicians with their technical brilliance, expressive improvisation, and commitment to the art form.[4][6]
