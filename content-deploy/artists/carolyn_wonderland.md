## Biography
Carolyn Wonderland, born Carolyn Bradford in Houston, Texas in 1972, grew up surrounded by music, with a singer for a parent and a house full of instruments[2][3][4]. She began playing guitar at age six, and by eight had already identified herself as a musician, developing a distinctive fingerpicking style after an early mishap with her mother's Martin guitar[2]. By her mid-teens, Wonderland was performing at Houston's Fitzgerald's club, absorbing influences from local blues legends and even swapping songs with folk icon Townes Van Zandt at age sixteen[2][4].

In the early 1990s, Wonderland formed her first band, Carolyn Wonderland and the Imperial Monkeys, quickly gaining recognition in Houston's vibrant club scene and touring nationally[2][3]. A pivotal moment came after a performance at Austin's Antone's club, leading her to relocate to Austin in 1999, where she became a fixture in the city's blues scene[2][3]. She has released several acclaimed albums, including 'Miss Understood,' produced by Ray Benson of Asleep at the Wheel, and more recently 'Truth Is' on Alligator Records[3][7]. Wonderland is celebrated for her soulful vocals, virtuosic guitar work, and her ability to blend blues with country, swing, zydeco, gospel, soul, and cumbia[3].

Wonderland's legacy is marked by her genre-defying approach, instrumental versatility (guitar, slide guitar, mandolin, trumpet, piano), and her role in keeping Texas blues vital in the modern era[3][1]. She has earned accolades such as Austin Music Awards for Best Blues Artist and Best Guitarist, and induction into the Austin Music Hall of Fame[8]. Her music has appeared in television series, and she is recognized as an influential figure by peers and fans, including Bob Dylan and Ray Benson[3][1].
