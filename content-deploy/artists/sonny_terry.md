## Biography
Sonny Terry, born Saunders Terrell on October 24, 1911, near Greensboro, Georgia, was a pioneering American blues harmonica player and singer-songwriter. Raised in a musical family, Terry began playing harmonica at age eight, learning from his father and developing a distinctive style marked by rapid single-note runs, expressive whoops, and vocal effects that mimicked trains and barnyard animals. His musical journey was shaped by adversity: he lost most of his sight in two separate childhood accidents, which prevented him from working as a farmer and led him to pursue music professionally[1][2][5][7].

Terry's early career was rooted in the Piedmont blues tradition of the American South, performing at tobacco warehouses, house parties, and on street corners in North Carolina. In the mid-1930s, he formed a partnership with Blind Boy Fuller, recording several influential sides for the Vocalion label and gaining regional acclaim. Terry's national profile rose after his appearance at John Hammond's 'Spirituals to Swing' concert at Carnegie Hall in 1938. Following Fuller's death in 1941, Terry began a legendary collaboration with guitarist Brownie McGhee, a partnership that lasted more than three decades and brought the duo international fame during the folk and blues revival of the 1950s and 1960s. Terry also performed and recorded with other blues luminaries, including Reverend Gary Davis, Mississippi John Hurt, and Big Bill Broonzy[2][3][4][5][7].

Sonny Terry's energetic harmonica technique, blending rural blues traditions with urban influences, became a cornerstone of classic blues and country blues. His work with McGhee helped bridge the gap between folk and blues, introducing the genre to new audiences worldwide. Terry's legacy endures as one of the foremost exponents of blues harmonica, influencing generations of musicians and leaving an indelible mark on American music[1][2][5].
