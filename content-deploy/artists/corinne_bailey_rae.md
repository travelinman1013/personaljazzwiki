## Biography
Corinne Jacqueline Bailey Rae was born on February 26, 1979, in Leeds, West Yorkshire, England. She studied English language and literature at the University of Leeds, graduating in 2000. Her musical journey began in the late 1990s when she formed an indie group called Helen, inspired by female-fronted acts like Veruca Salt and L7. Though the band attracted attention from Roadrunner Records, the deal ultimately fell through. During this period, Bailey Rae worked as a cloakroom attendant at a Leeds jazz club, where she began singing in quieter moments and developed a deep affinity for soul and jazz music, particularly after beginning a relationship with saxophonist Jason Rae, whose extensive record collection profoundly influenced her artistic direction.

Bailey Rae's solo career took off in the mid-2000s following collaborations with Leeds-based musicians and producers. Her self-titled debut album, released in February 2006, debuted at number one on the UK charts and peaked at number four on the US Billboard 200, eventually selling over four million copies worldwide. The album's lead single, "Put Your Records On," became her signature song and established her as a major international artist. She was named the BBC's Sound of 2006 and won two MOBO Awards for Best UK Female and Best UK Newcomer. Her silky smooth brand of R&B, characterized by her delicate and graceful voice, drew comparisons to Billie Holiday and showcased her ability to blend jazz, soul, pop, rock, and indie influences.

Bailey Rae's career was marked by both critical acclaim and personal tragedy. In 2008, her husband Jason Rae died from an accidental overdose of methadone and alcohol, an event that profoundly affected her life and music. She channeled her grief into her second album, *The Sea*, released in January 2010, which debuted at number five on the UK charts and number seven on the US Billboard 200. The album was nominated for the Mercury Prize and demonstrated her artistic maturity and emotional depth. Throughout her career, Bailey Rae has earned Grammy Awards, including Best R&B Performance in 2012 for her cover of Bob Marley's "Is This Love," and has collaborated with distinguished musicians including Herbie Hancock. She has also become an ambassador for charitable organizations and continues to be recognized as a significant figure in contemporary R&B and soul music.
