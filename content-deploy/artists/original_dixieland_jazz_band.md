## Biography
The Original Dixieland Jazz Band (ODJB), formed in New Orleans in 1916, is widely recognized as the first group to commercially record jazz music. The original lineup featured cornetist Nick LaRocca, clarinetist Larry Shields, trombonist Eddie Edwards, pianist Henry Ragas, and drummer Tony Sbarbaro, all of whom had honed their craft in the vibrant brass bands of New Orleans, particularly under the leadership of Papa Jack Laine. Their energetic and syncopated style drew from ragtime, blues, and local dance music, capturing the lively spirit of early jazz.

After relocating to Chicago and then New York, ODJB made history in 1917 by recording "Livery Stable Blues" and "Dixieland Jass Band One-Step," the first jazz records ever issued. Their recordings became national hits, introducing jazz to a broad audience and helping to define the genre's early sound. The band's most famous composition, "Tiger Rag," became a jazz standard. ODJB toured extensively in the United States and Europe, including a notable stint in London, and their success inspired countless musicians to explore jazz.

Though the band's popularity waned by the mid-1920s, their pioneering recordings had a profound and lasting impact. ODJB's legacy lies in their role as ambassadors of jazz, bringing the music from New Orleans dance halls to the world stage and influencing the development of jazz as a major musical idiom.
