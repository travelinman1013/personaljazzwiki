## Biography
Bubbles Brown is a one-man blues band, singer-songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist originally from Florida, now based in New Orleans, Louisiana. Growing up in a musical family, he began his journey with drums and bass before moving on to guitar and other instruments, influenced by his father and sister's musical pursuits. In 2007, Brown sold all his possessions to move to Chicago, where he spent 15 years honing his craft as a street musician and busker, deeply immersing himself in the city's blues and folk scenes.

During his time in Chicago, Brown formed a significant partnership with Washboard Ben after opening for Ben's country band at a house show. The duo performed and recorded together for a decade, releasing two independent records and gaining both local and national recognition. They opened for acts such as The Doors with Robby Krieger, Lilly Mae, The Weeks, and Southern Avenue, and were selected as Musicians in Residence in Spring Green, Wisconsin. After the duo parted ways, Brown embarked on a solo career, traveling from Duluth to Miami before settling in New Orleans, where he continues to perform regularly, particularly at the Apple Barrel Bar on Frenchmen Street.

Bubbles Brown's musical style is a raw, gritty blend of blues, folk, soul, country, jazz, R&B, gospel, and Appalachian influences. His performances are characterized by a home-spun, kitchen-sink aesthetic combined with modern energy, creating a sound that is both nostalgic and progressive. Brown's unique approach and dedication to his craft have made him a respected figure in contemporary blues and roots music.
