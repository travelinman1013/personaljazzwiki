## Biography
Freddy Fender, born Baldemar Garza Huerta on June 4, 1937, in San Benito, Texas, was a Mexican-American musician who rose from poverty to become a pioneering figure in blending country, rock, and Tejano music. The son of migrant farm workers, Fender began his musical journey at age ten, singing Spanish-language songs on KGBS radio in Harlingen. After dropping out of high school, he served three years in the United States Marine Corps before returning to South Texas, where he performed under various stage names including El Bebop Kid and Scotty Wayne. In 1959, he adopted the stage name Freddy Fender by combining his guitar brand with the first name Freddy. His early career faced significant obstacles, including a three-year prison sentence in Angola State Prison in Louisiana in 1960 for marijuana possession, but he persevered, working as a mechanic and performing in New Orleans clubs alongside Aaron Neville and Dr. John.

Fender's mainstream breakthrough came in 1975 when producer Huey Meaux helped him record "Before the Next Teardrop Falls" at SugarHill Recording Studios in Houston. This bilingual song became a historic achievement, reaching Number 1 on both Billboard's pop and country charts—the first time any artist's debut single achieved such prominence on both charts simultaneously. The song also marked the first bilingual hit on country charts, as Fender had improvised a Spanish verse during the studio session. This success launched an extraordinary run from 1975 through 1977, during which he achieved twelve Top 20 country hits, including four Number 1 songs. Billboard named him "Top Male Artist" of 1975, and he received the Academy of Country Music's "Most Promising Male Vocalist" award that same year.

Beyond his solo success, Fender became a cornerstone of Tex-Mex supergroups, co-founding the Texas Tornados in 1989 with Doug Sahm, Flaco Jiménez, and Augie Meyers, and Los Super Seven in 1998 with members of Los Lobos and other prominent Tejano musicians. His signature sound fused country, rock, swamp pop, and Tex-Mex styles, creating a bridge between Latin and American popular music. Throughout his four-decade career, Fender earned numerous accolades including Grammy Awards for his group work (Texas Tornados in 1991 and Los Super Seven in 1999) and his solo album "La Musica de Baldemar Huerta" (Best Latin Pop Album, 2002). He was inducted into the Conjunto Music Hall of Fame (1986), received a Hollywood Walk of Fame Star and Texas Music Hall of Fame induction (1999), and earned the Tejano R.O.O.T.S. Hall of Fame Lifetime Achievement Award (2002). Fender passed away on October 14, 2006, in Corpus Christi, Texas, at age 69, leaving behind a legacy as an icon whose influence on rock-and-roll, country, and Tejano musicians remained substantial.
