## Biography
Bob Seger was born on May 6, 1945, in Dearborn, Michigan, and emerged as one of the most significant rock artists of the 1970s and 1980s.[1][4] Beginning his professional career in the mid-1960s with local Detroit bands, Seger initially performed as Bob Seger and the Last Heard, achieving his first major local success in 1966 with "East Side Story," which sold 50,000 copies in Detroit.[1] Throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s, he recorded under various configurations including the Bob Seger System, but struggled to achieve national recognition despite his growing reputation as a talented rock musician with a distinctive, gritty voice.

Seger's breakthrough came in 1974 when he formed the Silver Bullet Band with Detroit-area musicians including guitarist Drew Abbott, drummer Charlie Allen Martin, keyboardist Rick Manasa, bassist Chris Campbell, and saxophonist Alto Reed.[1] This partnership proved transformative, and in 1976, Seger achieved his national breakout with the studio album *Night Moves*, whose title track became a No. 4 hit on the Billboard Pop Singles chart.[1] The album also featured "Mainstreet" and "Rock and Roll Never Forgets," establishing Seger as a major rock force. His 1976 live album *Live Bullet*, recorded at Detroit's Cobo Hall in 1975, further cemented his success and would eventually sell six million copies in the US.[1]

Throughout the late 1970s and 1980s, Seger maintained his commercial dominance with a string of platinum albums including *Stranger in Town* (1978), which produced the iconic "Old Time Rock and Roll," *Against the Wind* (1980)—his first and only No. 1 album on the Billboard chart—and *Like a Rock* (1986).[1][3][4] In 1987, Seger achieved his only No. 1 pop single with "Shakedown" from the *Beverly Hills Cop II* soundtrack, earning an Oscar nomination as co-writer.[1] With a career spanning six decades, Seger has sold over 75 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling artists of all time.[1][2] He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004 and the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2012, and was named Billboard's 2015 Legend of Live honoree.[2][5]

## Fun Facts
- Seger's iconic recording of "Old Time Rock and Roll" was named one of the Songs of the Century in 2001 and became immortalized in pop culture through the 1983 film *Risky Business*.[2][3]
- "Shakedown," Seger's only No. 1 pop single, was originally intended for Glenn Frey of the Eagles, but when Frey lost his voice just before the recording session, he asked Seger to take his place; Seger changed the verses but kept the chorus as written.[1]
- Seger's breakthrough album *Night Moves* (1976) became his biggest-selling studio album, certified at 6 million copies in the United States as of 2006, and its success bolstered sales of his previous releases, with *Beautiful Loser* (1975) eventually selling two million copies.[1]
- Seger announced his farewell tour in September 2018 after a career spanning six decades, during which he maintained a reputation as one of rock's greatest live performers, earning Billboard's 2015 Legend of Live honoree award.[2]
