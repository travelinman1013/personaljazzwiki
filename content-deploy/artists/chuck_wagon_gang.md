## Biography
The Chuck Wagon Gang was founded in 1935 in Lubbock, Texas, by farmer D.P. 'Dad' Carter (David Parker Carter, b. September 25, 1889) with his son Ernest ('Jim') and daughters Lola ('Rose') and Effie ('Anna'), initially as the Carter Quartet, to earn money for Effie's pneumonia medicine through radio performances on KFYO. They quickly gained popularity for their tight harmonies, moved to WBAP in Fort Worth as Bewley's Chuck Wagon Gang, and recorded their first sessions in 1936 for American Record Corporation (later Columbia Records), shifting from a mix of secular western, folk, and gospel to exclusively gospel music by the early 1940s.[1][2][5]

The group endured World War II hiatus, numerous personnel changes—including Howard Gordon joining in 1953 and Dad Carter retiring in 1955—while recording 408 masters for Columbia over 39 years, becoming one of the label's top sellers behind Xavier Cugat and ahead of Johnny Cash. Promoted by Wally Fowler for all-night singings, they transitioned to full-time touring, performing at Carnegie Hall, Hollywood Bowl, Grand Ole Opry, and internationally, with radio dominance, TV appearances on shows like Gospel Roundup and with Wilburn Brothers, and fan support from presidents.[1][2][3][4]

Today, over 80 years later, the group continues as the oldest recording mixed gospel ensemble with ties to founders; current alto Shaye Smith is granddaughter of Effie Carter and Howard Gordon. Inducted into the Gospel Music Association Hall of Fame in 1998, they maintain a legacy of southern gospel, country Christian, and traditional hymns, praised by Marty Stuart and Eddie Stubbs as America's foremost country-gospel singers.[1][2]
