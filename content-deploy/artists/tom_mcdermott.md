## Biography
Tom McDermott, born in St. Louis, Missouri in 1957, is a renowned pianist and composer celebrated for his mastery of ragtime and New Orleans piano traditions. He began piano lessons at age seven, inspired by his mother and aunt, and was performing professionally by sixteen. After earning a Master of Music degree from Washington University in St. Louis in 1982, McDermott worked briefly as a music journalist before relocating to New Orleans in 1984—a move that would define his career and musical identity.

Immersing himself in the vibrant musical culture of New Orleans, McDermott quickly became a fixture on the local scene, absorbing influences from legendary pianists like James Booker, Professor Longhair, and Dr. John. He played with the Dukes of Dixieland throughout the 1990s, touring internationally and recording several acclaimed albums. In 1994, he co-founded the innovative brass band New Orleans Nightcrawlers, further cementing his reputation as a versatile and inventive musician. McDermott's discography spans nearly twenty albums, traversing genres from traditional jazz and ragtime to Brazilian choro, and his compositions have been featured in theater, television, and film.

A prolific writer and educator, McDermott has lectured at institutions such as Harvard University and published a book of limericks. His legacy is marked by his dedication to preserving and expanding the traditions of New Orleans piano, his collaborations with a diverse array of artists, and his influence on both peers and younger generations of musicians.
