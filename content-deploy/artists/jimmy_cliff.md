## Biography
Jimmy Cliff, born James Chambers on July 30, 1944, in Somerton, Jamaica, is a legendary reggae singer, songwriter, and actor who played a pivotal role in bringing reggae music to the global stage[1][3]. As a teenager, Cliff moved from the countryside to Kingston, where he began recording singles and quickly rose to prominence with his hit 'Hurricane Hattie' for Leslie Kong’s Beverley Records[1][3][6]. His early work blended pop, ska, and emerging reggae sounds, reflecting the vibrant cultural shifts of post-independence Jamaica[2].

In 1965, Cliff relocated to London at the invitation of Chris Blackwell of Island Records, expanding his musical palette to include soul and rhythm and blues influences[1][2]. By the late 1960s, he was an international favorite, especially in South America, following his success with 'Waterfall' at a Brazilian festival. His 1970 album 'Wonderful World, Beautiful People' became a global hit and notably inspired Paul Simon to explore reggae[1][2][3][4]. Cliff’s starring role in the 1972 film 'The Harder They Come' and his contributions to its soundtrack, including 'Many Rivers to Cross,' cemented his status as reggae’s first international superstar[1][3].

Although his fame was later eclipsed by Bob Marley, Cliff remained influential, especially in Africa and South America, and enjoyed renewed popularity with his 1993 cover of 'I Can See Clearly Now.' His career is marked by Grammy-winning albums such as 'Cliff Hanger' (1985) and 'Rebirth' (2012), and he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2010[1]. Cliff’s innovative blend of reggae, rocksteady, and roots reggae, along with his socially conscious lyrics, have left an indelible mark on world music.
