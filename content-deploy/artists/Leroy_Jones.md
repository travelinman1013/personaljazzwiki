## Biography
Leroy Jones, born February 20, 1958, in New Orleans, Louisiana, is a celebrated jazz trumpeter renowned for his deep connection to the city’s musical heritage. He began playing trumpet at the age of ten and quickly distinguished himself as a prodigy. By age twelve, Jones was leading the Fairview Baptist Church Marching Band, a youth ensemble organized by the legendary Danny Barker to revive the brass band tradition in New Orleans. When the musicians' union forced Barker to disband the group in 1974, Jones took over, renaming it the Hurricane Brass Band and further cementing his leadership in the local jazz scene.[1][3][4]

Jones’s career blossomed as he toured with artists such as Eddie Vinson and Della Reese before forming his own Leroy Jones Quintet. In 1991, he joined Harry Connick, Jr.’s big band, gaining international exposure and later releasing his debut album 'Mo’ Cream From The Crop' on Columbia Records in 1994. Jones’s style is a vibrant blend of traditional New Orleans jazz, influenced by greats like Louis Armstrong, and modern jazz elements, particularly bebop. He is widely regarded as a 'keeper of the flame' for New Orleans jazz, and his efforts have been pivotal in the revival and preservation of the city’s brass band tradition. Jones continues to perform globally, both as a solo artist and with ensembles such as the Preservation Hall Jazz Band and Dr. John, leaving a lasting legacy on jazz music.[1][2][4]
