## Biography
Albert Lee, born December 21, 1943, in Lingen, Herefordshire, England, is widely regarded as one of the most influential guitarists in modern music. Raised in Blackheath, London, in a Romani family, Lee began his musical journey on piano at age seven before switching to guitar in 1958, inspired by the likes of Buddy Holly and Jerry Lee Lewis. He left school at sixteen to pursue music full-time, quickly establishing himself in the vibrant London scene of the 1960s, first gaining recognition with Chris Farlowe's Thunderbirds.

Lee's career blossomed as he joined the pioneering country-rock band Heads, Hands & Feet, where his lightning-fast hybrid picking and fingerstyle technique earned him the reputation of a 'guitar hero.' Throughout the 1970s and beyond, Lee became a sought-after collaborator, performing and recording with legends such as Eric Clapton, The Everly Brothers, Emmylou Harris, and The Crickets. His versatility allowed him to traverse genres from R&B and rock to country, and he was instrumental in the Everly Brothers' 1983 reunion, serving as their musical director for over two decades. Lee's solo work and his leadership of the band Hogan's Heroes further cemented his legacy, and his signature Ernie Ball Music Man guitar remains iconic among guitarists.

Celebrated for his humility and musicianship, Lee has won numerous accolades, including a Grammy Award in 2002 for his contribution to 'Foggy Mountain Breakdown.' His influence extends across generations, and he continues to tour internationally, inspiring both peers and younger musicians with his unparalleled technique and dedication to the craft.
