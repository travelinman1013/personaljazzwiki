## Biography
Sara Martin, born Sara Dunn on June 18, 1884, in Louisville’s Smoketown neighborhood, Kentucky, was a pioneering figure in early blues music. She began her career as a vaudeville singer around 1915, performing on the African-American Theater Owners' Booking Association (TOBA) circuit and with local jug bands—a style blending African American folk traditions and jazz instrumentation. Her deep, full-bodied voice and theatrical stage presence quickly made her a standout performer, earning her the nickname 'The Famous Moanin’ Mama.'

Martin secured a recording contract with Okeh Records in 1922 at age 38, launching a prolific recording career that spanned over 100 sides through the 1920s. She collaborated with legendary musicians such as Fats Waller, Clarence Williams, King Oliver, Sidney Bechet, and Sylvester Weaver, and was among the first female blues singers to be recorded. Her repertoire included classic blues, vaudeville comedy songs, and even foxtrots, with hits like 'Sugar Blues,' 'Mean Tight Mama,' and 'Death Sting Me Blues.' Martin toured extensively, performing in major US cities and internationally in Cuba, Puerto Rico, and Jamaica, and appeared in the 1929 film 'Hello Bill' with Bill 'Bojangles' Robinson.

As the blues fad waned in the early 1930s, Martin retired from show business, returning to Louisville to open a nursing home and sing gospel in her local church choir. Her influence extended beyond her recordings; she helped popularize blues as an American art form and paved the way for future generations of female blues singers. Sara Martin died of a stroke on May 24, 1955, and was buried in Louisville Cemetery in an unmarked grave.
