## Biography
Joey DeFrancesco was born in Philadelphia in 1971 into a family deeply rooted in jazz; his father, "Papa" John DeFrancesco, was a respected organist, and his grandfather, Joseph DeFrancesco, was also a musician[1][2][7]. Joey was recognized as a child prodigy, mastering jazz standards on the Hammond organ by age five and sitting in on his father's gigs with legendary Philadelphia musicians such as Hank Mobley and Philly Joe Jones[1][3][7]. He attended the High School for the Creative and Performing Arts alongside future stars like Christian McBride and Questlove, and by age 16, he had signed his first record contract[3]. At 17, he toured Europe as a member of Miles Davis’ band, making him one of the youngest musicians ever recruited by Davis[2][6].

DeFrancesco’s career is marked by his revival of the Hammond B-3 organ in jazz, which had faded in popularity by the mid-1980s[1][7]. Through his virtuosic technique and deep groove, he reignited interest in organ jazz, recording over 30 albums as a leader and collaborating with artists such as Ray Charles, Van Morrison, Diana Krall, George Benson, John Scofield, and Houston Person[1][2][3][6]. His musical style blended traditional jazz organ with blues and modern influences, creating a distinct sound recognized for its rhythmic drive and soulful expressiveness[1][2]. DeFrancesco was also a multi-instrumentalist, proficient on trumpet, piano, keyboard, and later tenor saxophone[1][3][6].

Throughout his career, DeFrancesco received numerous accolades, including five Grammy nominations, induction into the Hammond Organ Hall of Fame, and multiple DownBeat Magazine Critics and Readers Poll awards[1]. He was widely regarded as the preeminent jazz organist of his generation, leaving a legacy as both a performer and educator who inspired a new wave of jazz organists and musicians worldwide[2][3].
