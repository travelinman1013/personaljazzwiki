## Biography
Elles Bailey is a Bristol-born singer-songwriter whose distinctive smoky voice and genre-blending style have established her as a leading figure in the modern blues, Americana, and roots scenes. Bailey’s musical journey began in her teens, fronting an indie band before embarking on a solo career after completing a degree in Psychology. A childhood illness left her with her signature husky vocals, which would later become a hallmark of her sound[2][3].

Bailey’s debut album, 'Wildfire' (2017), was recorded in Nashville and featured collaborations with top-tier musicians from both the UK and the US, including Grammy-winning guitarist Brent Mason and Hammond organist Jonny Henderson[3]. Her follow-up, 'Road I Call Home,' won 'Blues Album of the Year' at the UKBlues Awards, and she has since received multiple accolades, including 'Blues Artist of the Year' and induction into the UK Blues Hall of Fame[1][4][6]. Bailey’s music weaves together blues, country, and soulful rock, marked by authenticity and emotional depth. Her 2024 album 'Beneath The Neon Glow' and its reimagined edition have further cemented her reputation for powerful songwriting and live performance[5][7].

Beyond her recordings, Bailey is known for her relentless touring schedule and advocacy for diversity in music, notably supporting the Key Change initiative for gender balance in the industry[1]. Her influence extends across the UK and European blues scenes, where she is celebrated for her passionate performances and commitment to her craft.
