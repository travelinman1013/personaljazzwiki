## Biography
Ed Wills is a self-taught blues guitarist, singer, and songwriter born in 1958 and raised in New Orleans, Louisiana. Growing up in the vibrant 'Uptown' area, Wills was immersed in the city's rich musical heritage from an early age. His passion for music was sparked at just eight years old, when his Aunt Cora, a slide guitarist from Tchula, Mississippi, introduced him to the instrument and the expressive power of the blues. 

Wills began performing professionally in 1986 after being discovered by Wilson Victorian of the Bayou Renegades, where he played rhythm guitar and sang backup vocals, touring throughout Louisiana. Over the years, he developed a distinctive style rooted in the 'South Louisiana Style Blues,' blending traditional blues with the syncopated rhythms and lively grooves unique to New Orleans. Heavily influenced by local legends and jazz greats, Wills' guitar work is noted for its soulful phrasing and rhythmic complexity. As the leader of his band, Blues 4 $ale, he has become a fixture on Frenchmen and Bourbon Streets, performing regularly at premier New Orleans venues and touring across the U.S., Europe, Canada, and South America. 

Wills' music is a celebration of New Orleans' blues tradition, characterized by energetic live performances and a deep respect for the genre's roots. Through his decades-long career, he has contributed to keeping the spirit of New Orleans blues alive, inspiring both audiences and fellow musicians with his authentic sound and dedication to the craft.
