## Biography
The Uniques were a Jamaican rocksteady and reggae vocal harmony group formed in 1966, emerging during a transformative period in Jamaican music history. The group was founded by Slim Smith and Roy Shirley and became recognized as one of Jamaica's finest harmony trios, spanning the rocksteady era through early reggae. Active with varying line-ups until the late 1970s, The Uniques developed a sophisticated vocal approach that complemented the evolving sound of Jamaican popular music during the 1960s and 1970s.

The group's musical style was characterized by tight vocal harmonies and their ability to adapt to the shifting genres of Jamaican music. As rocksteady transitioned into reggae, The Uniques demonstrated remarkable versatility, maintaining their relevance across both genres. Their work during this period established them as significant contributors to the development of reggae vocal traditions, influencing subsequent generations of harmony-based reggae groups.

The Uniques' legacy extends beyond their active years, with their recordings remaining influential in reggae and lovers rock circles. The group was later reconstituted in 1997 under the production of Winston 'Niney' Holmes, featuring members Cornell Campbell, Jimmy Riley, and Al, demonstrating the enduring appeal of their musical approach and the respect they commanded within the reggae community.
