## Biography
Todd Herbert is a tenor saxophonist and composer originally from Evanston, Illinois, whose career has been defined by a deep commitment to the hard bop tradition and a quiet, persistent dedication to his craft[1][2][8]. Herbert began his musical journey as a clarinetist at age nine, but soon switched to alto saxophone, drawn by the expressive possibilities of the instrument. His formative years were shaped by exposure to bebop and, most profoundly, by the music of John Coltrane, whose album 'Live at Birdland' was introduced to him by his saxophone teacher and proved transformative[8]. Herbert attended the University of Miami, where he studied under Gary Campbell and permanently adopted the tenor saxophone as his voice[8].

After graduating with a degree in Jazz Studies, Herbert returned to Chicago and quickly established himself on the professional scene, joining organist Charles Earland for two years of regular performances and international touring[8]. He subsequently worked with legendary trumpeter Freddie Hubbard, an experience he describes as the highlight of his career, and later moved to New York City, where he performed with Jimmy Cobb and led his own ensembles at venues such as Smalls, the Iridium, Fat Cat’s, and Minton’s[1][8]. Herbert’s discography includes notable releases like 'The Path To Infinity' (2007), 'The Tree of Life,' and 'Captain Hubs' (2025), each showcasing his reverence for jazz tradition, especially the influence of Coltrane, while also pushing the genre forward through original compositions and energetic improvisation[2][5][7].

Herbert’s musical style is characterized by a reserved, cool tone steeped in tradition, yet marked by inexhaustible energy and a willingness to explore new harmonic and rhythmic territory[2][5]. Though not a household name, he is highly respected among jazz musicians and critics for his substance-over-spectacle approach and his role in keeping jazz a living, evolving art form[2].

## Fun Facts
- Herbert wrote the composition 'Captain Hubs' as a tribute to his former bandleader, Freddie Hubbard[7].
- He switched from clarinet to alto saxophone at age nine, but it was hearing Coltrane's 'Live at Birdland' at age 13 or 14 that convinced him to pursue jazz saxophone seriously[8].
- Herbert is known for keeping a low profile, releasing only four albums over more than two decades despite a busy performance career[2][7].
- He has performed at iconic New York jazz clubs including Smalls, the Iridium, Fat Cat’s, and Minton’s[8].
