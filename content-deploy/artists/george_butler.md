## Biography
George Butler, known professionally as George "Wild Child" Butler, was an influential American blues harmonica player, guitarist, and vocalist, born on October 1, 1936, in Autaugaville, Alabama[4][5][6]. Butler grew up immersed in the rural blues traditions of the Deep South, playing at local 'jook' joints and learning harmonica from older musicians in his community[3]. His mother nicknamed him 'Wild Child' for his energetic and mischievous nature, a moniker that stuck throughout his career[5].

In the late 1950s, Butler began performing with regional bands, gradually honing his distinctive style that combined raw Delta blues with urban Chicago influences[6]. He made his first recording in 1964, releasing the single "Aching All Over" on the Shaw label, which marked his entry into the professional blues scene[3]. Butler relocated to Chicago, where he recorded extensively and collaborated with many notable blues musicians, although he often found greater success touring outside the city[3]. His harmonica playing was characterized by expressive phrasing and a gritty, soulful tone, earning him recognition among blues aficionados.

Butler's legacy lies in his authentic approach to blues music, bridging Southern juke joint traditions and the electric Chicago sound. He continued to record and perform until his death on March 1, 2005, leaving behind a catalog of recordings that capture the spirit of classic American blues[4].
