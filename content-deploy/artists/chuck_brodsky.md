## Biography
Chuck Brodsky was born on May 20, 1960, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where he was raised in Bala-Cynwyd. As a young child, he fell in love with the piano and took lessons, though he largely taught himself to play. His early exposure to music came through working as a teenager at the Main Point, a legendary Philadelphia folk club where he encountered great songwriters and performers. In 1981, at university orientation, Brodsky saw two musicians playing guitars, which inspired him to get his own guitar and eventually transfer out of university to pursue music full-time. He then embarked on an adventurous life that would deeply inform his songwriting: hitchhiking to San Francisco, singing for tips on European streets, working as a migrant fruit picker, driving an ice cream truck, laboring on an Israeli kibbutz, and serving as a bank courier—experiences that taught him the value of everyday human stories.

Brodsky's professional music career began in earnest in the late 1980s when he started performing in small coffeehouses around the San Francisco Bay Area. He signed with Red House Records in 1996 and released *Letters in the Dirt*, which introduced audiences to his distinctive storytelling style through characters like a roadside peach vendor and the first white baseball player in the Negro Leagues. His 1998 album *Radio* achieved even greater acclaim, becoming the 3rd most frequently played album on Americana stations nationwide for a three-month period and earning critical recognition for its satirical takes on American culture. Over the past 33 years, Brodsky has performed at festivals and concerts across the USA, Canada, Ireland, Denmark, England, Israel, Lithuania, Latvia, Wales, and the Shetland Islands of Scotland, establishing himself as a prolific touring artist.

Brodsky's artistic legacy is particularly strong in baseball music, with 22 of his baseball story songs enshrined in the National Baseball Hall of Fame's sound recording library, and he has performed at the Hall of Fame three times. His songs have appeared in numerous films and documentaries, including the 2003 Sony Pictures film *Radio* (in which he also made a cameo), the PBS film *Jews and Baseball: An American Love Story*, and various ESPN, NPR, NFL Films, and PBS productions. In April 2019, he was inducted into the Philadelphia Jewish Sports Hall of Fame for his baseball songs. Now living in Asheville, North Carolina for over two decades, Brodsky continues to write and perform music that celebrates oddball and underdog characters while addressing social and political themes. His approach combines wit, irony, and genuine warmth, drawing listeners in with finely crafted, rootsy acoustic songs that tell stories of everyday people with grace and humor.
