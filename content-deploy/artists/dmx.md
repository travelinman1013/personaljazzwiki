## Biography
Earl Simmons, known professionally as DMX, was born on December 18, 1970, in Mount Vernon, New York, and raised primarily in the School Street housing projects of Yonkers, New York. He endured a profoundly traumatic childhood marked by physical abuse from his mother, neglect, poverty, bronchial asthma, and frequent illnesses, leading to time spent in group homes, on the streets sleeping in Salvation Army bins, and befriending stray dogs. Expelled from middle school at age ten and unable to complete high school track due to poor grades, DMX turned to music as an outlet, starting to rap around age 13 with a 'spellbound' style using spelled-out words, and later beatboxing for local rappers before adopting the name DMX—inspired by the Oberheim DMX drum machine, standing for 'Dark Man X' or similar variants—while battling figures like Jay-Z and releasing early mixtapes like 'DMX: Unleashed and Unreleased'.[1][2][3][4][5]

DMX's career gained traction in the late 1980s and early 1990s amid jail stints for crimes like carjacking, which solidified his resolve to pursue rap seriously. After an unsuccessful stint with Columbia/Ruffhouse Records (releasing 'Born Loser'), he signed with Ruff Ryders Entertainment in a joint venture with Def Jam in 1997-1998, exploding onto the scene with his debut album *It's Dark and Hell Is Hot* (1998), which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, sold 251,000 copies in its first week, and featured hits like 'Ruff Ryders' Anthem' and 'Get at Me Dog'. His raw, aggressive east coast hardcore hip hop style—characterized by barking ad-libs, growled delivery, and themes of street life, inner demons, addiction, and spirituality—revitalized hardcore rap post-Tupac, with follow-up albums like *Flesh of My Flesh, Blood of My Blood* (1998) also topping charts, alongside guest spots on tracks by LL Cool J, Ma$e, and The LOX.[1][2][3][4][6]

A founder and prominent member of Ruff Ryders (alongside The LOX, Eve), DMX's legacy endures as a gritty voice of pain and resilience, though plagued by lifelong drug addiction, legal troubles, and personal struggles; he passed away on April 9, 2021. His music blended old school and hardcore hip hop influences, earning critical acclaim for authenticity and commercial success with hits like 'Party Up (Up in Here)'.[1][2][3]
