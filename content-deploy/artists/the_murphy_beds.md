## Biography
The Murphy Beds is a folk duo comprised of Eamon O’Leary, originally from Dublin, Ireland, and Jefferson Hamer, a Massachusetts native based in Brooklyn, New York. The two musicians met in New York City in the early 2000s, bonding over their shared love of traditional Irish, American, Scottish, and English folk songs. O’Leary, who grew up immersed in Irish music, moved to New York in the early 1990s and quickly became a fixture in the city’s vibrant traditional music scene. Hamer, with roots in both Massachusetts and Colorado, brought a background in American roots and acoustic music, as well as a keen interest in the British folk tradition.

Their collaboration began in larger ensembles but soon evolved into a duo, allowing them to focus on close vocal harmonies and intricate instrumental interplay on bouzouki, guitar, and mandolin. The Murphy Beds are known for their carefully curated repertoire, blending traditional songs with original compositions, and for their arrangements that highlight the subtle connections between Irish and American folk traditions. Their self-titled debut album and their 2021 release, 'Easy Way Down,' have been praised for their grace and musicality, with performances at major festivals and venues across North America and Europe, including the Kennedy Center and Doolin Folk Festival.

The duo’s legacy lies in their ability to breathe new life into old songs while maintaining a deep respect for the tradition. Their work has contributed to the ongoing dialogue between Celtic and American folk music, influencing both audiences and fellow musicians through their thoughtful interpretations and collaborative spirit.
