## Biography
Yamandu Costa (sometimes spelled Yamandú) is a Brazilian guitarist and composer born on January 24, 1980, in Passo Fundo, Rio Grande do Sul, in Brazil’s southernmost region near the borders with Argentina and Uruguay.[1][3][8] Raised in a musical family, he began studying guitar at the age of seven with his father, Algacir Costa, leader of the regional group Os Fronteiriços, and later deepened his technique under Argentine virtuoso Lúcio Yanel, who was living in Brazil.[1][3] Immersed from childhood in Brazilian popular music and the folk traditions of southern Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay, he developed a command of the violão de sete cordas (seven‑string guitar), made his first major public appearance around age 17 in São Paulo, and soon attracted national attention through competitions and festival appearances.[1][3][4][6] 

Over the late 1990s and 2000s, Costa built an international career as both virtuoso soloist and composer, blending choro, bossa nova, samba, milonga, tango, chamamé, and other regional styles into a highly personal idiom grounded in improvisation and rhythmic freedom.[1][2][3][5] He has released numerous recordings—solo, in duo and trio formats—and has appeared as a featured soloist with major ensembles such as the Brazilian Symphony Orchestra, the São Paulo Symphony Orchestra, the Calgary Philharmonic, and the Orchestre National de France, helping to bring the Brazilian seven‑string guitar to concert stages worldwide.[3] Critically acclaimed works include albums such as *Recanto* (nominated for a 2018 Latin Grammy for Best Instrumental Album), *Quebranto* (winner of Prêmio da Música Brasileira for Best Instrumental Album), *Vento Sul* (named one of the 25 best Brazilian albums of the second half of 2019 by the São Paulo Association of Art Critics), and the live collaboration *Toquinho e Yamandu Costa – Bachianinha (Live at Rio Montreux Jazz Festival)*, which won the 2021 Latin Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Album.[1][3][4] 

Costa’s musical style is marked by breathtaking technical virtuosity, dense counterpoint, and an improvisatory approach that often blurs the line between written composition and spontaneous creation, earning him comparisons with earlier Brazilian guitar innovators while resisting easy categorization.[1][2][3][4][5] Drawing deeply on the legacy of Brazilian guitarists such as Raphael Rabello and the broader traditions of South American popular and folk music, he has become a leading figure of a new generation of Brazilian string players, inspiring younger musicians who follow what some commentators describe as a “new school” of seven‑string guitar playing.[3] His many awards—including the Prêmio Visa (Instrumental, 2001), Prêmio Tim for Best Soloist (2004), and multiple Latin Grammy nominations and one win—underline his status as one of the foremost contemporary exponents of Brazilian instrumental music, and he continues to tour internationally, presenting the richness of Brazilian and Latin American music to audiences around the world.[1][3][4][5]

## Fun Facts
- Costa’s main instrument is the Brazilian violão de sete cordas (seven‑string classical guitar), which he uses to create such dense textures that critics liken the sound to far more than seven strings.[1][3][5]
- He made his first major public appearance as a teenager, around age 17, in a cultural tour sponsored by Banco do Brasil in São Paulo, and this early exposure helped launch his national career.[4][6]
- His composition “Samba Pro Rapha” is widely regarded by fans and commentators as his signature piece and a magnum opus, written as a joyful tribute to the late guitarist Raphael Rabello.[2]
- Costa’s 2019 album *Vento Sul* was selected by the São Paulo Association of Art Critics as one of the 25 best Brazilian albums released in the second half of 2019, an unusual honor for an instrumental guitar record.[1]
