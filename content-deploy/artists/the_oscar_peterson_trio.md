## Biography
The Oscar Peterson Trio, led by Canadian pianist Oscar Peterson, became one of the most influential and celebrated ensembles in jazz history. Born in Montreal, Quebec, in 1925, Peterson was a prodigy who began playing piano at age five and was performing professionally by his teens. After early work with the Johnny Holmes Orchestra, Peterson formed his first trio in 1948, initially featuring piano, bass, and drums. His breakthrough came in 1949 when jazz impresario Norman Granz invited him to perform at Carnegie Hall, launching Peterson onto the international stage.

The trio's classic lineup—Oscar Peterson (piano), Ray Brown (bass), and Herb Ellis (guitar)—set a new standard for small-group jazz in the 1950s. Their interplay was marked by technical virtuosity, rhythmic drive, and a seamless blend of swing, bebop, and blues influences. The group was known for both dazzling improvisational feats and sophisticated arrangements, producing landmark albums such as 'Night Train' and 'On the Town with the Oscar Peterson Trio.' Over the years, the trio's personnel evolved, with notable members including Barney Kessel, Ed Thigpen, Joe Pass, and Niels-Henning Ørsted Pedersen, but Peterson's leadership and vision remained central.

The Oscar Peterson Trio's legacy endures through its extensive discography—over 200 albums—and its profound impact on jazz performance. Peterson's insistence on musical equality among trio members, his pioneering role in racially integrated groups, and his compositions like 'Hymn to Freedom' (which became a civil rights anthem) have cemented the trio's place in jazz history. Their influence continues to inspire generations of musicians worldwide.
