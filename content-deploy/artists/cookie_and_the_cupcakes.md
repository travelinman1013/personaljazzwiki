## Biography
Cookie and the Cupcakes, originating from Lake Charles, Louisiana, are widely recognized as pioneers of the 'swamp pop' genre—a soulful blend of rhythm and blues, early rock and roll, Cajun, and zydeco influences. The group began in the early 1950s as The Boogie Ramblers, led by Shelton Dunaway, with Huey 'Cookie' Thierry joining as vocalist and saxophonist in 1952. By 1956, Thierry had become the frontman, and the group adopted the name Cookie and the Cupcakes after it was shouted as a joke from an audience member. Their early years saw them become the house band at the Moulin Rouge Club in Lake Charles and tour with major acts like Jerry Lee Lewis and Fats Domino.

Their biggest success came in 1958 with the recording of 'Mathilda,' which reached #47 on the Billboard pop chart in 1959 and is now considered the unofficial anthem of swamp pop. The band followed up with several notable singles, including 'Belinda,' 'Betty and Dupree,' and 'Got You on My Mind.' Cookie and the Cupcakes also served as the backing band for Phil Phillips' classic hit 'Sea of Love.' Despite their regional popularity, the group never matched the national success of 'Mathilda.' After Thierry moved to California in 1965, 'Little Alfred' Babino took over as lead singer, and the band continued until dispersing in the early 1970s.

The legacy of Cookie and the Cupcakes endures through their influence on Louisiana music and the swamp pop genre. Thierry was rediscovered in the 1990s and reunited with the band for festival performances until his death in 1997. The group was inducted into the Music Hall of Fame at the Museum of the Gulf Coast in 1995, cementing their place in American musical history.
