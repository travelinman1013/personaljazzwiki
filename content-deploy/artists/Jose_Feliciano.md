## Biography
José Feliciano, born José Montserrate Feliciano García on September 10, 1945, in Lares, Puerto Rico, is a pioneering Puerto Rican singer, guitarist, and composer renowned for his virtuosic guitar technique and soulful voice. Blind from birth, Feliciano moved with his family to New York City at age five, where he immersed himself in music, learning to play the accordion and guitar by ear. His early exposure to both Latin and American popular music shaped his distinctive style, blending bolero, jazz, pop, and rock influences.

Feliciano's career breakthrough came in the mid-1960s after a successful performance at Argentina's Mar del Plata Festival led to his first Spanish-language recordings, including the hit 'Poquita Fe.' He achieved international fame with his 1968 English-language album 'Feliciano!' and his innovative cover of The Doors' 'Light My Fire,' which won him two Grammy Awards. In 1970, his self-penned holiday classic 'Feliz Navidad' became a perennial favorite worldwide. Over his decades-long career, Feliciano has released more than 50 albums in multiple languages, earning nine Grammy Awards, a Latin Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

Regarded as the first Latin artist to successfully cross over into the English-language market, Feliciano's legacy includes opening doors for generations of Latino musicians. His unique fusion of genres and expressive guitar work have influenced countless artists, and his contributions are celebrated with numerous honors, including induction into the International Latin Music Hall of Fame and the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History.
