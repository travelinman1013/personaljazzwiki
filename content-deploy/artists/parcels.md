## Biography
Parcels is a five-piece band originating from Byron Bay, Australia, formed in 2014 by Louie Swain, Patrick Hetherington, Noah Hill, Anatole 'Toto' Serret, and Jules Crommelin. Growing up together, the members shared a passion for classic albums, groove-based music, and the art of songwriting, which led them to start producing and writing music during their final year of high school. Eager to pursue their musical ambitions, Parcels relocated to Berlin shortly after forming, immersing themselves in the city's vibrant electronic scene and quickly evolving from a strictly electronic group to one that embraced live instrumentation and a retro-modern sound[1][3][4][7].

Their debut EP 'Clockscared' (2015) and subsequent singles released on the French label Kitsuné established their reputation for lush harmonies and infectious grooves. Parcels gained international attention with 'Overnight,' a single co-written and produced by Daft Punk, which showcased their blend of funk, disco, soul, and soft rock influences[2][4]. Their self-titled debut album arrived in 2018, followed by ambitious projects like the double album 'Day/Night' in 2021. Parcels' meticulous musicianship, vintage aesthetics, and energetic live performances have earned them a dedicated global following and appearances at major festivals including Coachella, Lollapalooza, and Glastonbury[3][4].

Musically, Parcels are known for their seamless fusion of retro and contemporary styles, drawing inspiration from artists such as The Beatles, The Beach Boys, Steely Dan, and Chic. Their commitment to groove, melody, and harmony has set them apart as innovators within the indie soul and dance-pop genres, while their collaborative spirit and international outlook continue to shape their evolving legacy[2][3][4].
