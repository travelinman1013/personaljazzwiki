## Biography
Ella Fitzgerald, born April 25, 1917, in Newport News, Virginia, overcame a difficult childhood marked by poverty and family instability to become one of the most celebrated jazz vocalists of the 20th century[1][2][7]. After her mother's death, Fitzgerald struggled with homelessness and reform school, but her fortunes changed dramatically when she won an amateur contest at Harlem's Apollo Theater in 1934[2][3]. This victory led to her joining the Chick Webb Orchestra, where her 1938 recording of 'A-Tisket, A-Tasket' became a national sensation and established her as a rising star[1][4].

Following Chick Webb's death in 1939, Fitzgerald took over as bandleader before launching a solo career in the early 1940s[1][4]. She became renowned for her pure tone, impeccable diction, and especially her virtuosic scat singing—a style she helped popularize in jazz[1][3][5]. Under the management of Norman Granz, Fitzgerald recorded the landmark 'Songbook' series for Verve Records, interpreting classics by Cole Porter, Duke Ellington, and George Gershwin, among others[1][5]. Her collaborations with jazz greats such as Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington further cemented her legacy[1][5].

Known as the 'First Lady of Song,' Fitzgerald's career spanned nearly six decades, during which she won 14 Grammy Awards and sold over 40 million albums[1][2][5]. Her influence extended far beyond jazz, inspiring generations of vocalists with her technical mastery and emotional depth. Fitzgerald's contributions to American music were recognized with numerous honors, including the National Medal of Arts and the Presidential Medal of Freedom[1][5]. She passed away on June 15, 1996, leaving behind an enduring legacy as one of the greatest interpreters of the Great American Songbook.
