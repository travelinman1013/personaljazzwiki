## Biography
Information about a musical artist specifically named '95MP' could not be verified from credible sources. The search results returned information about '95 South,' a Miami bass duo from the 1990s-2000s best known for their 1993 hit 'Whoot (There It Is),' but this is a different artist. Additionally, results included 'Mike Will Made It' (a prominent trap producer), 'MP Ancient/MotionPlus' (a hip-hop artist from Quincy, Illinois), 'MP Gannon' (a Nashville-based slide guitarist), and 'MP' (Michael Peh, a production music composer), none of which match the specific artist name '95MP.' Without verified information from reliable music databases or official sources, a comprehensive biography cannot be accurately provided.
