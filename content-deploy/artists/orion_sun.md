## Biography
Tiffany Maureen Majette, professionally known as Orion Sun, is an American singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and producer born in Mount Laurel, New Jersey. She grew up in a gospel church and began her musical journey by posting her first song, 'Voicemail,' to YouTube in 2013. After relocating to Philadelphia, she became involved in the underground collective The Forest, which shaped her early career until its dissolution following a member's death. Her experiences with isolation, poverty, and homelessness deeply inform her songwriting, which explores themes of love, grief, and insecurity.[1][2][3][8]

Orion Sun's debut mixtape, 'A Collection of Fleeting Moments and Daydreams,' appeared in 2017, followed by singles like 'S T R E T C H' and 'Nirvanaaa.' Her critically acclaimed first LP, 'Hold Space for Me' (2020), established her as a distinctive voice in alternative R&B and bedroom pop, blending influences from jazz, indie rock, and hip hop. Her music is marked by poetic lyricism and emotional vulnerability, and she is recognized for her ability to play numerous instruments, including guitar, ukulele, bass, and harmonica. After being injured by police at a racial justice protest in 2020, she released 'Mama's Baby,' donating its proceeds to social justice causes.[1][2][3][5][6]

Orion Sun continued to evolve artistically, releasing the EP 'Getaway' in 2022 with contributions from notable producers and opening for Daniel Caesar in 2023. Her self-titled album 'Orion' (2024) and subsequent 'The Rising Sun Tour' further solidified her legacy as a visionary artist whose work resonates with themes of healing, self-discovery, and compassionate connectivity. Now based in Los Angeles, Orion Sun is celebrated for her genre-defying sound and her role as a queer Black woman artist advocating for authenticity and emotional honesty in music.[1][2][5][6]
