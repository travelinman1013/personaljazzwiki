## Biography
Ney de Souza Pereira, professionally known as Ney Matogrosso, was born on August 1, 1941, in Bela Vista, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. Raised in a family marked by both discipline and art—his father was a military man and his mother a pianist—Ney developed an early fascination for music and theater. After a stint in the air force and performing in vocal quartets, he moved to São Paulo in 1971, adopting his stage name as a tribute to his home state. That same year, he joined the groundbreaking glam rock group Secos & Molhados, whose bold visual style and subversive lyrics made them a sensation and sold over a million records in less than two years.

Following the group's dissolution in 1974, Ney embarked on a solo career that would span decades and nearly 50 albums. Renowned for his countertenor voice, theatrical stage presence, and androgynous persona, he became a symbol of artistic freedom and queer expression in Brazil, especially during the oppressive military dictatorship. His solo work traversed genres such as MPB (Música Popular Brasileira), samba, pop, and avant-garde, and he collaborated with many of Brazil's most important composers. Ney's performances, often featuring extravagant costumes and choreography, challenged gender norms and social conventions, leaving a profound impact on Brazilian culture.

Over the years, Ney Matogrosso has received numerous accolades, including the Latin Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2014. He is celebrated not only for his musical innovation but also for his courage in confronting prejudice and expanding the boundaries of popular music and performance art in Brazil.
