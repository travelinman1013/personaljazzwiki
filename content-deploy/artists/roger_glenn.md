## Biography
Roger Glenn was born on June 11, 1945, into jazz royalty as the son of Tyree Glenn, a renowned swing-era trombonist and vibraphonist who performed with Cab Calloway and Duke Ellington. Raised in New York City and later Englewood, New Jersey, Glenn absorbed a diverse spectrum of musical traditions during his formative years, laying the foundation for his career as one of jazz's most versatile multi-instrumentalists. His recording debut came with legendary pianist and composer Mary Lou Williams, and he quickly established himself as a supremely talented improviser capable of mastering over 18 instruments including flute, vibraphone, saxophone, clarinet, marimba, piccolo, and baritone sax.

Throughout his decades-long career, Glenn became known as "the secret sauce" behind some of jazz and Latin jazz's most iconic recordings, contributing to classic albums with Cuban percussion maestro Mongo Santamaria, pioneering funk-jazz trumpeter Donald Byrd, and Latin jazz virtuoso Cal Tjader. His versatility kept him in constant demand, leading him to perform with an extraordinary array of legends including Dizzy Gillespie, Herbie Mann, Taj Mahal, Kurt Elling, and the Count Basie Orchestra. Despite accumulating credits on more than 40 albums and touring extensively across North America, New Zealand, and Australia, Glenn remained largely behind the scenes, elevating the music of established masters while developing his own distinctive voice that seamlessly fused jazz improvisation with the rhythmic vitality of Afro-Caribbean and Latin American traditions.

At age 80, Glenn stepped into the spotlight as a bandleader and composer with his first new album in four decades, "My Latin Heart," released in 2025. This release marked a significant milestone in his career, offering the most revealing glimpse yet of a jazz giant who had been hiding in plain sight. Glenn's philosophy, instilled by his father, was to "create your own sound," and his mastery of 18-plus instruments allowed him to select the best voice for each musical moment, making him a singular figure in contemporary jazz and Latin music.

## Fun Facts
- Glenn is a master of 18-plus instruments, including flute, vibraphone, saxophone, clarinet, marimba, piccolo, baritone sax, and even triangle, allowing him to select the most appropriate instrument for each song he performs.
- His spontaneous collaboration with Cal Tjader began when Glenn sat in on the last number of the last set at a performance in Monterey with Dizzy Gillespie; Tjader was so impressed that he invited Glenn to join him in the studio the next day, resulting in the Grammy-winning album 'La Onda Va Bien.'
- Despite accumulating credits on more than 40 albums and performing with jazz legends including Dizzy Gillespie, Mongo Santamaria, Donald Byrd, and the Count Basie Orchestra, Glenn remained largely behind the scenes for decades before stepping into the spotlight as a bandleader and composer with his first new album in four decades at age 80.
- Glenn was featured as a product endorser at the NAMM Show, showcasing the FRAP (flat response audio pickup) created for use on acoustic instruments, which was attached to his flute to demonstrate the pickup's capabilities across his versatile instrumental skills.
