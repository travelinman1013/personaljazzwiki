## Biography
Roxy Music is an English rock band formed in 1970 by Bryan Ferry and Graham Simpson, with Ferry serving as the group's charismatic lead vocalist and principal songwriter. The band's classic lineup soon included Andy Mackay (saxophone/oboe), Phil Manzanera (guitar), Paul Thompson (drums), and Brian Eno (synthesizer), whose experimental approach helped define their early sound. Emerging from the British glam and art rock scenes, Roxy Music quickly set themselves apart with their sophisticated blend of pop hooks, avant-garde experimentation, and striking visual style, debuting with their self-titled album in 1972 and the hit single 'Virginia Plain.'[2][1]

Throughout the 1970s, Roxy Music pioneered a musically innovative and visually glamorous approach that influenced both punk and new wave movements. Their albums, including 'For Your Pleasure' (1973), 'Stranded' (1973), 'Country Life' (1974), and 'Siren' (1975), achieved critical and commercial success, particularly in the UK and Europe. After Brian Eno's departure in 1973, Ferry became the band's focal point, and their sound evolved toward a more polished and romantic style, culminating in their final studio album, 'Avalon' (1982), which achieved platinum status in the US. The band experienced several breakups and reunions, most notably reuniting in 2001 and again in 2022 for their 50th anniversary. Roxy Music was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2019, cementing their legacy as one of the most influential British bands of their era.[2][1][3]

Roxy Music's legacy extends beyond their own recordings; members such as Bryan Ferry and Brian Eno have had significant solo careers, with Eno becoming a renowned producer. The band's innovative fusion of glam, art rock, and electronic elements, as well as their focus on fashion and visual presentation, have left a lasting impact on generations of musicians and artists.[2][5]
