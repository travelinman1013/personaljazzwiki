## Biography
Boy Blue is an award-winning hip-hop dance company founded in 2001 in East London by composer Michael 'Mikey J' Asante, MBE, and choreographer Kenrick 'H2O' Sandy, MBE. The company quickly established itself as a pioneering force in the UK dance scene, known for blending the foundations of American hip-hop with distinctly British influences such as jungle, grime, and garage. Boy Blue's work is characterized by its innovative choreography, bass-driven electronic scores, and a commitment to exploring themes of social tension, cultural identity, and community celebration.

Over the past two decades, Boy Blue has nurtured hundreds of young dancers, providing a transformative platform for emerging talent and fostering a vibrant community space in East London. Their breakthrough came in 2007 with 'Pied Piper: A Hip-Hop Dance Revolution,' which won a Laurence Olivier Award and set a new standard for hip-hop in UK theatre. As Associate Artists at the Barbican, Boy Blue has continued to push creative boundaries, with their biennial showcase 'A Night With Boy Blue' becoming a staple event for both audiences and critics. The company's legacy lies in its ability to inspire, educate, and empower the next generation of dancers while continually redefining the possibilities of hip-hop performance.
