## Biography
Parlor Greens is a contemporary organ trio that emerged in 2024 as a collaborative project between three accomplished musicians in the soul and blues revival scene. The band was brought together by Colemine Records founder Terry Cole and recorded their debut album 'In Green / We Dream' at Cole's newly established studios in Loveland, Ohio. The trio's formation was notably organic—guitarist Jimmy James, organist Adam Scone, and drummer Tim Carman had never played together before entering the studio, yet they achieved immediate chemistry that resulted in what has been described as premium organ trio soul music. Their sound draws heavily from the legacies of 1960s organ-guitar-drums masters including Dr. Lonnie Smith, Melvin Sparks, and Bernard 'Pretty' Purdie, creating a vintage aesthetic with contemporary execution.

The band's musical identity is characterized by funky, soulful instrumental compositions that blend elements of soul jazz, blues, and Meters-style funk. Their debut LP 'In Green / We Dream' was the first album recorded in Terry Cole's Loveland studios and quickly became a sold-out release. Following the success of their debut, Parlor Greens released the 45 'Driptorch / 200 Dollar Blues' in February 2025, featuring the gritty title track and a blues shuffle instrumental. The trio has also reimagined Dolly Parton's 'Jolene' with their distinctive soul flavor, demonstrating their versatility beyond original compositions. Despite being geographically dispersed—with members based in Boston, Fort Lauderdale, and Seattle—the band has developed a reputation for seamless musical collaboration and has performed at notable venues including the Telluride Jazz Festival and Seattle's City Hall Plaza.

Parlor Greens represents a significant entry in the contemporary soul revival movement, with critics and industry figures recognizing them as one of the most exciting projects in instrumental music. The band's appeal lies not only in their technical proficiency but in their genuine musical camaraderie and shared reverence for soul and blues traditions. Their work has positioned them as torchbearers of the organ trio format, introducing this classic sound to contemporary audiences while maintaining authenticity to the genre's roots.
