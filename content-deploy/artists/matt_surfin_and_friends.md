## Biography
Matt Surfin' and Friends is a collaborative indie rock collective founded by New Orleans musician and producer Matt Seferian. Born in Washington, D.C. and raised in Houston, Seferian became a stalwart of the New Orleans music scene, playing in bands such as Donovan Wolfington, Pope, and My Father's Rifle before launching his own project. The idea for Matt Surfin' and Friends emerged from Seferian's desire to break away from the traditional, insular band structure and instead create an open, welcoming collective that could showcase the talents of his extended network of friends and fellow musicians.

The group’s self-titled debut album, released after over two years of recording, exemplifies this ethos of collaboration. Rather than adhering to a single style, the album traverses a wide range of indie rock, power pop, and lo-fi sounds, with each track featuring different combinations of contributors. Seferian’s approach results in a fluid and cohesive record that balances diverse influences while maintaining a sense of community and warmth. The project is as much about celebrating friendship and creative synergy as it is about the music itself, with Seferian openly crediting and celebrating his collaborators in the album’s liner notes.

Matt Surfin' and Friends has become a testament to the vibrancy and interconnectedness of the New Orleans indie scene. By prioritizing collaboration and inclusivity, Seferian has crafted a musical legacy that highlights the power of collective creativity, offering a refreshing alternative to the solitary image often associated with indie rock artists.

## Fun Facts
- The name 'Matt Surfin'' originated from a college graduation mispronunciation of Matt Seferian's last name, not from actual surfing prowess.
- Seferian once attempted surfing while on tour in San Diego, but the experience was, by his own admission, disastrous.
- The debut album features an insert with personal blurbs written by Seferian about each friend who contributed to the project.
- Matt Surfin' and Friends is as much a social experiment in collaboration as it is a musical project, intentionally blurring the lines between band and collective.
