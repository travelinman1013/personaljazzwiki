## Biography
Poncho Sánchez (born Ildefonso Sanchez on October 30, 1951) is an American conguero, Latin jazz band leader, and salsa singer who has become one of the most significant figures in Latin jazz over more than four decades. Originally a guitarist, Sánchez discovered his vocal talents during an audition for the R&B band The Halos in his youth, eventually teaching himself flute, drums, and timbales before committing to conga drumming in high school. At age 24, after performing in local clubs and weddings while working at an aluminum foundry by day, he landed a permanent position with vibraphonist Cal Tjader's band in 1975, a transformative collaboration that would shape his artistic vision and introduce him to Afro-Caribbean sounds and Latin jazz traditions.

Following Cal Tjader's death in 1982, Sánchez embarked on a solo career that would span nearly four decades with Concord Picante Records. Before his passing, Tjader recommended that Concord Records founder Carl Jefferson sign Sánchez and his newly formed group, with the first two records composed and arranged by longtime Tjader collaborator Clare Fischer. Sánchez's breakthrough came with his landmark 1999 album Latin Soul, a bold, groove-heavy blend of salsa, soul, and boogaloo that earned him the Grammy Award for Best Latin Jazz Album in 2000, cementing his status as a genre-defining artist. Throughout his prolific career, he has released over 30 recordings for Concord Picante, maintaining one of the label's longest and most successful artist relationships.

Sánchez's musical style represents a distinctive fusion of straightahead jazz, gritty soul music, and infectious Latin American and South American rhythms and melodies. He has carried forward the torch lit by innovators such as Mongo Santamaria, Tito Puente, and Cal Tjader, earning recognition as one of the premier conga drummers in jazz. His discography includes critically acclaimed albums such as Soul of the Conga (2000), Latin Spirits (2001), Out of Sight! (2003), Do It! (2005), Raise Your Hand (2007), and Psychedelic Blues (2009), demonstrating his versatility across hard bop, funk, and traditional Latin jazz styles.
