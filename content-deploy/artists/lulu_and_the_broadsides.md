## Biography
Lulu and the Broadsides is a blues and R&B band fronted by American singer-songwriter Dayna Kurtz, formed in December 2017 in New Orleans. The band emerged in response to the city's vibrant underground dance scene, quickly earning a reputation for their energetic live shows and vintage-inspired sound. Drawing from classic rhythm and blues, soul, and rock and roll, Lulu and the Broadsides specialize in music that encourages dancing, blending original compositions with carefully curated covers and reinterpretations of obscure gems. Their sound is characterized by rich, smoky vocals, tight grooves, and a playful yet soulful approach that pays homage to the great blues shouters like Big Maybelle and Big Mama Thornton.

Over the years, Dayna Kurtz has built an international reputation as a riveting live performer and a writer’s writer, admired for her deep, honeyed voice and eclectic songwriting. With Lulu and the Broadsides, she channels her love for vintage R&B and blues into a dynamic group setting, backed by a supergroup of New Orleans musicians. The band has performed at major festivals such as the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, French Quarter Festival, and Lincoln Center’s Midsummer Night Swing, earning praise for their ability to capture the spirit of classic 45 RPM-era music while bringing their own modern flair. Their debut EP was released in 2019, followed by a self-titled full-length album in 2022, both showcasing their signature blend of groove, soul, and musical camaraderie.
