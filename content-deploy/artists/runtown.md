## Biography
Douglas Jack Agu, known professionally as **Runtown**, is a Nigerian singer, songwriter, and producer born on 19 August 1989 in Enugu, Enugu State, Nigeria.[1][2] He spent his childhood between Enugu, Abuja, and Lagos; after his father’s death, he moved to Abuja with his mother, who worked with Nigeria’s Ministry of Health, before later returning to Enugu and then relocating to Lagos to pursue music.[2][4][5] Initially harbouring ambitions of becoming a basketball player, he gravitated toward music, drawing early inspiration from artists such as **Sean Kingston, Bob Marley, and Kanye West**.[5]

Runtown began his professional journey around 2007 when he moved to Lagos with close friend and rapper Phyno; the pair stayed with singer-producer J. Martins, for whom Runtown co-wrote and produced on a second studio album, and through this circle he met Timaya, who became an important mentor and industry guide.[1][2][5] He released early singles including “Party Like It’s 1980” (2011) and gained mainstream recognition with the 2013 collaborative hit “Emergency” alongside Skales and Patoranking, produced by WizzyPro, which later won Best Collaboration at The Headies.[5] His true breakthrough came with “Gallardo” (2014) featuring Davido, which won Best Collaboration of the Year at the Nigeria Entertainment Awards and served as the lead single for his debut album **Ghetto University** (2015), released under Eric Many Entertainment and MTN Music Plus; the album reportedly generated over ₦35 million on the platform and placed him among the top five most streamed Nigerian artists there.[1][2][3][4] In subsequent years he established his own imprint **Soundgod Music Group** and continued to release acclaimed projects, including the EP **Tradition** (2019) and the album **Signs** (2022).[2]

Musically, Runtown is known for a **hybrid sound** that fuses Afrobeats with hip‑hop, R&B, reggae, dancehall, and contemporary pop, often delivered in a mellow, melodic vocal style.[1][2][5][8] His 2016 single **“Mad Over You”**—a self-produced ballad influenced by Ghanaian Alkayida rhythms and inspired by African beauty—became a continental anthem and peaked at No. 38 on Billboard’s Twitter Top Tracks chart, consolidating his profile as a leading voice in the global Afrobeats movement.[1][2] Critics and commentators have credited his catalogue—particularly songs like “Gallardo,” “Mad Over You,” and later singles from Tradition and Signs—with helping to carry Afrobeats and broader African pop sounds to international audiences, reinforcing his legacy as a versatile hitmaker and a bridge between street-ready African rhythms and global pop sensibilities.[2][5][8]

### Artists Influenced
- [[younger_afrobeats_and_altéafrofusion_artists_various_emerging|Younger Afrobeats and alté/afro‑fusion artists (various, emerging)]] - Runtown’s mellow, melodic fusion of Afrobeats, R&B, and Ghanaian‑influenced rhythms on songs like “Mad Over You,” along with his role in carrying Afrobeats to wider global audiences, is frequently cited in commentary as part of the template adopted by a younger generation of Nigerian and African pop artists; however, specific named protégés with documented mentorship ties are not clearly identified in authoritative sources. (“Mad Over You,” Ghetto University, Tradition, and Signs as reference points in discussions of Afrobeats’ globalisation and softer, mid‑tempo afro‑fusion aesthetics.[1][2][5][8]) [Late 2010s onward[1][2][5][8]]
