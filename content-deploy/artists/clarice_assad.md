## Biography
Clarice Assad, born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, is a Grammy-nominated composer, pianist, vocalist, and educator recognized for her remarkable versatility across classical, jazz, Brazilian, and world music genres. Growing up in one of Brazil’s most celebrated musical families—her father is the renowned guitarist and composer Sérgio Assad—Clarice began performing professionally at the age of seven. Her formal training included piano studies in Brazil, France, and the United States, and she holds degrees from Roosevelt University (Chicago College of Performing Arts) and the University of Michigan.

Assad’s career has been marked by an impressive output of over 70 compositions, including orchestral, chamber, and solo works, many commissioned by prestigious organizations such as Carnegie Hall, the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, and Orquestra Sinfônica de São Paulo. Her music is deeply influenced by Brazilian rhythms, jazz improvisation, and classical forms, resulting in a distinctive style noted for its evocative colors and rich textures. As a performer, she is celebrated for her inventive vocal techniques and dynamic stage presence, singing in multiple languages and often blending genres seamlessly. Assad is also an influential educator, founding the award-winning Voxploration program, which promotes spontaneous music creation using only the voice and body.

Her legacy includes collaborations with leading artists and ensembles worldwide, and her works have been recorded by luminaries such as Yo-Yo Ma, Dame Evelyn Glennie, and Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg. Assad’s innovative approach and commitment to musical outreach continue to inspire new generations of musicians and audiences alike.
