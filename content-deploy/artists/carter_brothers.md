## Biography
The Carter Brothers were an American R&B and soul group from Garland, Alabama, consisting of brothers Roman Carter (lead vocals, bass), Albert Carter (guitar), and Jerry Carter (vocals, piano). Active primarily from the 1960s through the 2000s, they emerged during the heyday of southern soul music, blending gospel roots with rhythmic R&B styles characteristic of the era. Their music aligned with the **northern soul** genre as cataloged on platforms like Spotify, emphasizing upbeat, danceable tracks that gained cult followings in soul scenes.[3]

Little is documented about their early lives beyond their origins in rural Alabama, but the trio's formation capitalized on familial harmonies and instrumental synergy honed in the American South. They recorded during a period when regional soul acts were discovering wider audiences through independent labels, though specific career milestones like major releases or chart success remain sparsely detailed in available sources. The group's longevity into the 2000s suggests persistent performances and recordings in soul and R&B circuits.[3]

Their legacy endures in niche soul communities, particularly northern soul enthusiasts, where their energetic sound contributes to the genre's revival. Despite low mainstream popularity (Spotify rating of 3), they represent the grassroots talent of Alabama's Black music heritage, influencing regional soul traditions without widespread commercial breakthrough.[3]
