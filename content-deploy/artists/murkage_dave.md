## Biography
Murkage Dave, born David Lewis in Leytonstone, East London, is a singer, songwriter, and DJ known for his emotionally resonant blend of UK R&B, garage, indie, and soul. He began his musical journey while studying in Manchester, where he launched the influential Murkage club night and later founded the Murkage Cartel—a creative collective of DJs, musicians, and artists that became a staple of the city's nightlife. After returning to London in 2016, Dave formed the duo HALFBROTHER with producer SCALLY and released the 'D.A.V.E' EP, which included the breakout track 'Car Bomb.' His early work garnered attention from industry figures like Pharrell Williams and Young Fathers, and he became known for his collaborative spirit, notably co-hosting the club night TONGA with Mike Skinner of The Streets.

Dave's debut album, 'Murkage Dave Changed My Life' (2018), showcased his signature introspective lyricism and genre-blending sound, earning critical acclaim for its vulnerability and British sensibility. The album featured collaborations with artists such as Manga Saint Hilare, Jaykae, and production from Skepta and Star Slinger. Dave has continued to expand his artistic reach, supporting acts like The Streets and Tricky on tour, and working with international talents including French rapper Nekfeu and American singer Caroline Polachek. His subsequent projects, like 'The City Needs A Hero' (2022) and its sequel, further cemented his reputation as a poignant storyteller and a vital voice in contemporary UK music.

Murkage Dave's music is marked by its honesty, emotional depth, and refusal to be confined by genre labels. Drawing from a wide palette of influences—ranging from UK garage and R&B to indie and dance—he has become a respected figure for his authenticity and community-focused approach, often engaging directly with fans and championing self-care and connection through his art.
