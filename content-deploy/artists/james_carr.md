## Biography
James Carr was born on June 13, 1942, in Coahoma, Mississippi, into the family of a Baptist minister. His family relocated to Memphis, Tennessee, when he was three, and Carr began singing solos in church by age six, later joining gospel groups such as the Harmony Echoes and the Redemption Harmonizers, the latter featuring future soul star O.V. Wright. As a teenager, Carr transitioned to secular music, performing in Memphis clubs while working various day jobs to support himself.

Carr's professional breakthrough came after teaming up with producer Quinton Claunch at Goldwax Records, where he released a string of soul singles beginning in the mid-1960s. His 1966 hit "You’ve Got My Mind Messed Up" reached number 7 on the Billboard R&B chart, and his 1967 recording of "The Dark End of the Street"—written by Dan Penn and Chips Moman—became his signature song, celebrated for its emotional depth and vocal intensity. Despite his immense talent and the acclaim of soul aficionados, Carr's career was hampered by severe depression and bipolar disorder, which led to sporadic recording and touring throughout the 1970s and 1980s.

A resurgence of interest in Carr's work in the late 1980s and 1990s, spurred by Peter Guralnick’s book 'Sweet Soul Music,' led to new recordings and festival appearances in the U.S. and Europe. Carr continued to record and perform until his health declined due to cancer; he died in Memphis on January 7, 2001. Today, Carr is revered as one of the greatest deep Southern soul vocalists, his legacy enduring through his emotionally charged recordings and influence on generations of soul musicians.
