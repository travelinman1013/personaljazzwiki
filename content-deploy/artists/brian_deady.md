## Biography
Brian Deady is an Irish soul and R&B singer-songwriter, born in Dublin and raised in Skibbereen, West Cork, as one of ten children. Growing up in relative poverty and spending part of his adolescence in state care, Deady found solace and expression through music, beginning to write lyrics and poetry as a teenager. His early experiences deeply influenced his confessional songwriting style, which is marked by emotional honesty and a powerful, soulful voice.

Deady emerged on the Irish music scene in the mid-2000s, initially gaining recognition through local gigs and festival appearances, including the Cork Jazz Festival and the It Takes A Village event. His breakthrough came with the independently released album 'Non-Fiction' in 2015, which drew critical acclaim for its raw storytelling and authentic soul sound. The album's success led to a re-release by Universal/Decca Records and a growing international profile, with radio play in the US and support slots for artists like Nile Rodgers. Deady continued to evolve artistically, recording his later album 'Yellow Creek' in Memphis, where he explored the roots of soul and gospel, further refining his blend of vintage and contemporary R&B.

Now based in Andalusia, Spain, Deady remains an influential figure in Irish soul, known for his emotionally charged performances and commitment to artistic authenticity. Despite setbacks, such as being dropped by his label, he has built a loyal fanbase and is recognized for his resilience and creative independence.
