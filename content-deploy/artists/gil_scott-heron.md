## Biography
Gilbert Scott-Heron was born on April 1, 1949, in Chicago, Illinois, to a distinguished but unconventional family.[1] His mother, Bobbie Scott, was a professional opera singer and teacher, while his father, Gil Heron, was a Jamaican-born footballer who became the first Black player for Celtic F.C. in Glasgow, Scotland.[1][2] When his parents divorced during his early childhood, Scott-Heron was sent to live with his grandmother, Lillie Scott, in Jackson, Tennessee, a civil rights activist and musician who profoundly shaped his artistic and political consciousness by introducing him to the piano and the poetry of Langston Hughes.[1][2] At age 12, following his grandmother's death, he relocated to the Bronx to live with his mother, where he enrolled at DeWitt Clinton High School before earning a full scholarship to the prestigious Fieldston School, one of only five Black students in his class—an experience that cultivated the bold, confrontational style that would define his later work.[1]

Scott-Heron's artistic trajectory bridged literature and music seamlessly. He attended Lincoln University in Pennsylvania, partly because Langston Hughes was an alumnus, where he met Brian Jackson and formed the band Black & Blues.[1] After two years, he took time off to write his first novels, *The Vulture* and *The Nigger Factory*, before pursuing graduate studies at Johns Hopkins University, where he earned an M.A. in creative writing in 1972.[1] His recording career launched in 1970 with the album *Small Talk at 125th and Lenox*, which established his signature fusion of jazz, blues, and soul with spoken-word delivery addressing social and political issues.[1] Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Scott-Heron became renowned as a jazz poet and social critic, fusing funk, jazz, and spoken word into politically charged commentary that challenged systemic racism, consumerism, and imperialism.[4] He maintained a teaching career as a full-time lecturer at the University of the District of Columbia while sustaining his prolific music career, releasing over fifteen albums before his death on May 27, 2011, in New York.[1][6]

## Fun Facts
- Scott-Heron was born on April Fools' Day (April 1), which he would later reference with characteristic wit in his work.
- At his Fieldston School admissions interview, when asked how he would feel seeing a classmate arrive in a limousine while he took the subway, he responded with the boldness that would define his career: 'Same way as you. Y'all can't afford no limousine. How do you feel?'
- Many of his most famous songs, including 'The Revolution Will Not be Televised,' began as poems that he later adapted into musical compositions.
- Despite not completing his undergraduate degree at Lincoln University, Scott-Heron went on to earn a Master's degree in creative writing from Johns Hopkins University, demonstrating his commitment to intellectual rigor alongside his musical career.
