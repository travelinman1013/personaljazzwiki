## Biography
Nina Simone, born Eunice Kathleen Waymon on February 21, 1933, in Tryon, North Carolina, was a prodigious pianist and vocalist whose artistry and activism left an indelible mark on 20th-century music and culture. Raised in a segregated Southern town, Simone began playing piano at age three, quickly demonstrating exceptional talent. Her community, recognizing her gifts, helped fund her classical training, and she later attended the Juilliard School in New York City. Despite her ambition to become the first major African American concert pianist, Simone was denied admission to the Curtis Institute of Music—a rejection she attributed to racial discrimination, a formative experience that deeply influenced her later activism and music.

To support herself, Simone began performing in Atlantic City nightclubs in the mid-1950s, adopting the stage name 'Nina Simone' to conceal her work from her religious mother. Initially hired as a pianist, she soon began singing at the urging of club owners, blending classical technique with jazz, blues, gospel, and folk influences. Her debut album, 'Little Girl Blue' (1958), featured the hit 'I Loves You, Porgy,' which propelled her to national attention. Throughout the 1960s, Simone became a prominent voice in the civil rights movement, using her music to address racial injustice and social change. Her repertoire expanded to include protest songs such as 'Mississippi Goddam' and 'To Be Young, Gifted and Black.'

Simone's musical style was eclectic, fusing classical precision with the improvisational spirit of jazz and the emotional depth of blues and soul. Her powerful performances and outspoken advocacy for civil rights earned her the title 'High Priestess of Soul.' Despite personal and professional challenges—including struggles with mental health and periods of self-imposed exile—Simone's influence endured. She spent her later years living abroad, particularly in France, and experienced a resurgence of interest in her work before her death on April 21, 2003. Simone's legacy endures through her recordings and her profound impact on generations of musicians and activists.

## Fun Facts
- Simone's stage name was chosen to hide her nightclub performances from her deeply religious mother: 'Nina' was a nickname from a boyfriend, and 'Simone' was inspired by French actress Simone Signoret.
- She was posthumously awarded an honorary degree by the Curtis Institute of Music in 2003, the school that had originally rejected her.
- Simone was an outspoken civil rights activist, and her song 'Mississippi Goddam' was banned in several Southern states for its candid protest against racism.
- She could play complex classical pieces by ear as a child and often incorporated classical motifs into her jazz and soul performances.
