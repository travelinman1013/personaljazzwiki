## Biography
Royal Fingerbowl was formed in New Orleans in the spring of 1995, emerging from the vibrant and eclectic Faubourg Marigny scene, an area known for its blend of jazz, poetry, Latin rhythms, and rock 'n' roll. The band was initially founded by singer-songwriter and guitarist Alex McMurray, who, after fibbing his way into a gig at the Dragon's Den, recruited drummer Kufaru Mouton and bassist Andy Wolf to complete the first lineup. Their music quickly drew attention for its unique fusion of New Orleans jazz, blues, funk, and Americana, layered with McMurray's imaginative storytelling and character-driven lyrics[1][2][6].

Royal Fingerbowl's career accelerated after recording a live demo that caught the ear of New York label TVT Records, leading to their acclaimed 1997 debut album, 'Happy Birthday, Sabo!'. The album was praised for its originality, drawing comparisons to Tom Waits for its blend of madness, roots, and genre-defying arrangements. The band's follow-up, 'Greyhound Afternoons' (2000), continued to showcase their seamless mix of lap steels, horns, and down-home storytelling, though the lineup evolved with musicians like Carlo Nuccio on drums and Matt Perrine on bass and horns. Despite a relatively brief run, Royal Fingerbowl left a lasting impression on the New Orleans music scene and beyond, with McMurray remaining a respected figure in regional music circles[1][3][5].

Musically, Royal Fingerbowl is celebrated for their ability to channel the spirit of New Orleans while crafting a sound that is timeless, unpredictable, and emotionally resonant. Their legacy is that of a cult favorite—an obscure but influential trio whose genre-blending approach and vivid narratives continue to inspire musicians seeking authenticity and creative freedom[3][4].
