## Biography
The Semi Colon was a Nigerian band formed in the 1970s under the direction of Lasbrey Ojukwu, emerging during a vibrant era of Nigerian music experimentation.[1] They carved out a unique niche with their bold fusion of **Afro-Rock**, blending highlife, afrobeat influences, and elements reminiscent of Ethiopian jazz as noted in modern streaming profiles, though their core sound rooted in 1970s Nigerian traditions.[1][2] Little is documented about individual early lives of members, but the band reflects the era's trend where many Nigerian musicians honed skills in military or police bands before transitioning to professional careers.[4]

The group's career peaked in the mid-1970s with releases like the track 'Nekwaha Semi Colon,' a staple of their discography available on platforms like Last.fm, showcasing their innovative Afro-Rock style that left a lasting mark on Nigerian music history.[1][3][4] Despite limited commercial success reflected in current low streaming popularity (Spotify score of 2), their work exemplifies the experimental spirit of the post-independence Nigerian scene, fusing local highlife rhythms with rock edges.[1][2] No detailed information on disbandment or later activities is available from sources.

Their legacy endures through reissues and archival recognition, influencing perceptions of 1970s Afro-Rock, though comprehensive discographies remain sparse.[1][3]
