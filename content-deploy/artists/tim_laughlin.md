## Biography
Tim Laughlin is a renowned clarinetist and composer, born in 1963 in New Orleans, Louisiana, where he continues to live and work[2][3][4][5]. He fell in love with the clarinet at an early age after hearing a childhood friend practice, and began playing the instrument at age nine[4][5]. Early exposure to jazz on the radio inspired him to focus his musical journey on the rich traditions of his hometown, drawing deeply from the New Orleans jazz idiom[4][5].

Laughlin's career has spanned over 35 years, during which he has become a fixture in the New Orleans jazz scene, performing at major festivals like Satchmo Summerfest and collaborating with many of the city’s top musicians[2][8]. He is celebrated not only for his mastery of the clarinet and his beautiful, fluid tone, but also for his work as a composer. His album 'The Isle of Orleans' (2002) features all original compositions, a rare feat among New Orleans clarinetists, and showcases his commitment to advancing the tradition by writing new standards for the 21st century[2][8].

Laughlin’s style is characterized by a blend of technical precision and lyrical expressiveness, influenced by both the early clarinet masters and the vibrant cultural mix of New Orleans. His legacy includes a body of original work that is ripe for reinterpretation by future generations, and a reputation as one of the city’s most respected jazz musicians[2][7][8].
