## Biography
Lecrae Moore, born in Houston, Texas, experienced a turbulent childhood marked by trauma, including an absent father struggling with addiction, neglect, abuse, and frequent moves across cities like Denver, San Diego, and Dallas. Raised primarily by a single mother without a religious household, he was drawn into a gangster lifestyle but found solace in music as an outlet to process his pain; Lauryn Hill's 'The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill' introduced him to gospel elements, sparking his interest in faith. At age 19, a youth conference—initially attended to meet girls—exposed him to The Cross Movement, leading to his conversion to Christianity; he graduated from the University of North Texas and began blending hip-hop with evangelical messages, releasing his debut album 'Real Talk' in 2004.

Lecrae's career evolved from Christian hip-hop stardom, with albums like 'Rebel' (2008)—the first Christian hip-hop release to top the Billboard Gospel chart—and 'Rehab' (2010) marking his transition toward mainstream appeal, challenging the 'Christian rapper' label through sophisticated lyrics on grace, struggle, and spiritual life infused with aggressive southern hip-hop. He co-founded Reach Records, earned multiple Grammys (including for 'Gravity' in 2013, 'Messengers' in 2015, and 'Church Clothes 4' in 2024), and became a New York Times bestselling author, activist, and entrepreneur, residing in Atlanta, GA. His style defies genres, collaborating across lines while addressing faith, racial tensions, and cultural reconciliation.

Lecrae's legacy lies in pioneering faith-infused hip-hop that resonates beyond Christian audiences, serving as a voice for meaning and resilience amid trauma, while urging the Church to engage culture and encouraging reconciliation with faith; his unashamed edge has influenced a generation, earning him recognition as a trailblazer despite controversies over mainstream moves.
