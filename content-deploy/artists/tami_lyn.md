## Biography
Tami Lynn, born Gloria Jean Brown on January 25, 1939, in Gert Town, New Orleans, Louisiana, was an American soul singer who became a defining voice of Northern soul and classic soul music. She grew up in a musically rich environment, attending school alongside future legends Allen Toussaint and Ellis Marsalis Jr., and began her musical journey singing spirituals with groups like the Clara Ward Singers and performing gospel on WMRY radio. Her professional career began almost by accident when she substituted for an absent performer at the Joy Tavern, impressing local musician Alvin "Red" Tyler, who became her mentor and helped her secure a recording contract with AFO Records. This launched her into the professional music world, where she would work as both a featured artist and session vocalist.

Lynn's career trajectory took her from New Orleans to New York City, where she performed at the legendary Birdland jazz club as an opening act for John Coltrane, Miles Davis, and Ella Fitzgerald during the 1960s. Her breakthrough came in 1971 when her song "I'm Gonna Run Away From You"—originally recorded in 1965 for Atlantic Records but not released until six years later—became a Top 10 hit on the UK Singles Chart, reaching number 4 and establishing her as a Northern soul favorite in Britain. The song's success led to her 1972 album "Love Is Here and Now You're Gone," produced by John Abbey. Beyond her solo work, Lynn became a highly sought-after session and backup vocalist, contributing to albums by Dr. John, the Rolling Stones (notably on their acclaimed "Exile on Main St."), King Floyd, and numerous other artists across soul, R&B, and rock genres.

Throughout her career, Lynn worked with an impressive roster of musicians including Wilson Pickett, Sonny & Cher, Billy Joel, Eric Clapton, George Benson, Ringo Starr, and Joe Cocker, establishing herself as a versatile and respected vocalist in the music industry. She later moved to Florida, where she continued performing into her later years, including an appearance at the Ponderosa Stomp in 2008. Tami Lynn passed away on June 26, 2020, leaving behind a legacy as a pioneering soul singer whose influence extended across multiple genres and whose "I'm Gonna Run Away From You" remains a celebrated anthem of Northern soul music.
