## Biography
Nathan Williams Sr., born March 24, 1963, in St. Martinville, Louisiana, grew up in a French Creole-speaking household surrounded by music. After losing his father at age seven, he was raised by his grandmother and was one of ten siblings. As a child, he was captivated by zydeco pioneers like Clifton Chenier, often sneaking peeks at Chenier's performances despite being too young to enter the clubs. Williams began his professional music career at 21, recording singles for his brother Sid’s El Sid label, and quickly became a staple performer in Lafayette’s local scene.

Williams’ big break came when Buckwheat Zydeco recommended him to Rounder Records, leading to a recording contract and the formation of Nathan & the Zydeco Cha-Chas in 1985, named after a Chenier instrumental. The band, a family affair with brothers, cousins, and later his son Nathan Jr., debuted at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival in 1988 and has since toured globally, performing at major venues and festivals, including the Lincoln Center, Grand Ole Opry, and the 1996 Summer Olympics. Their energetic blend of zydeco, jazz, blues, and R&B, mostly penned by Williams, has earned them accolades such as induction into the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame and multiple Big Easy Awards for Best Zydeco Band.

Nathan & the Zydeco Cha-Chas are credited with revitalizing zydeco for new generations, both in Louisiana and worldwide. Williams’ commitment to the genre is evident not only in his performances but also in his mentorship of younger musicians, including his own son. The group’s legacy is marked by their role in popularizing zydeco beyond its regional roots and their ongoing influence in the genre’s evolution.
