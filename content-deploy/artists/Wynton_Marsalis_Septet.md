## Biography
The Wynton Marsalis Septet, led by trumpeter and composer Wynton Marsalis, emerged in the late 1980s as a premier ensemble dedicated to exploring the full breadth of jazz’s history and its connections to American culture. Marsalis, born in New Orleans in 1961 to the renowned Marsalis musical family, was steeped in both jazz and classical traditions from an early age. After studying at the Juilliard School and performing with Art Blakey’s Jazz Messengers, Marsalis established himself as a major force in both genres, winning Grammy Awards in jazz and classical categories.

Formed in 1988, the Wynton Marsalis Septet became known for its ambitious projects that blended New Orleans jazz, swing, blues, gospel, and modern jazz idioms. The group’s core lineup included some of the era’s most celebrated jazz musicians: Wessell "Warmdaddy" Anderson (alto saxophone), Todd Williams (tenor and soprano saxophones, clarinet), Wycliffe Gordon (trombone), Reginald Veal (bass), Herlin Riley (drums), and Eric Reed or Marcus Roberts (piano), with Marsalis on trumpet. The Septet’s landmark works, such as the album "Blood on the Fields"—which won the Pulitzer Prize for Music—demonstrated Marsalis’s commitment to jazz as a living, evolving art form and as a vehicle for storytelling and social commentary.

The Septet’s musical style is characterized by a deep reverence for jazz tradition, intricate arrangements, collective improvisation, and a strong narrative thread. Their performances and recordings have been credited with revitalizing interest in jazz, inspiring a new generation of musicians, and reaffirming the genre’s significance in American culture. The group’s legacy endures through its members’ individual careers, Marsalis’s ongoing leadership at Jazz at Lincoln Center, and the many protégés who have passed through its ranks.
