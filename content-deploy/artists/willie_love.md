## Biography
Willie Love Jr. (November 4, 1906 – August 19, 1953) was an influential American Delta blues pianist and singer, born in Duncan, Mississippi. Love began his musical journey performing in juke joints and clubs throughout the Mississippi Delta, where his adeptness at both standard blues and boogie-woogie piano styles quickly earned him local renown. His early career was shaped by the vibrant blues scene of the 1930s and 1940s, and he was notably influenced by the piano stylings of Leroy Carr.

In 1942, Love met harmonica legend Sonny Boy Williamson II (Rice Miller) in Greenville, Mississippi, forging a close musical partnership that would define much of his career. Together, they performed regularly across the Delta and on the influential 'King Biscuit Time' radio show in Helena, Arkansas. Love became a sought-after accompanist, recording with Williamson and other prominent blues musicians such as Elmore James and Joe Willie Wilkins for Trumpet Records in the early 1950s. He also led his own sessions, most famously recording 'Everybody's Fishing' with his backing band, the Three Aces. Despite his talent and connections, Love's solo recording career was brief, with his final sessions taking place in 1953.

Love's legacy lies in his contributions to the Delta blues tradition, both as a collaborator and as a solo artist. His recordings, later compiled on albums such as 'Greenville Smokin',' showcase his expressive piano work and soulful vocals, cementing his place among the greats of Mississippi blues. Love's untimely death at age 46 from bronchopneumonia cut short a promising career, but his influence endures in the music of those he played with and inspired.
