## Biography
Gillian Welch, born October 2, 1967, in New York City, was adopted by Mitzie and Ken Welch, both comedy and music entertainers. Raised in Los Angeles from age three, she was immersed early in the world of music and television, as her adoptive parents wrote for 'The Carol Burnett Show' and appeared on 'The Tonight Show.' Welch's childhood was shaped by the sounds of American folk legends like Bob Dylan, Woody Guthrie, and the Carter Family, influences that would later define her musical identity. In high school, she was recognized for her wide-ranging talents, and during her time at the University of California, Santa Cruz, she experimented with various musical genres, playing bass in a goth band and drums in a psychedelic surf band. A pivotal moment came when she first heard The Stanley Brothers, sparking her deep connection to bluegrass and traditional American music.

After earning a degree in photography, Welch pursued songwriting at the Berklee College of Music in Boston, where she met guitarist David Rawlings. Their partnership, forged at an audition for Berklee's only country band, became the foundation of her career. Moving to Nashville in 1992, Welch and Rawlings began performing as a duo under her name, quickly gaining attention for their haunting harmonies and minimalist, roots-inspired sound. Their debut album, 'Revival' (1996), produced by T Bone Burnett, showcased Welch's evocative songwriting and was nominated for a Grammy Award. Over the following decades, Welch and Rawlings became central figures in the Americana, bluegrass, and folk scenes, known for blending early 20th-century musical traditions with contemporary sensibilities.

Welch's music is characterized by its spare arrangements, lyrical storytelling, and deep reverence for American roots music. Her work, both solo and with Rawlings, has influenced a generation of artists and contributed significantly to the resurgence of interest in traditional American genres. Her legacy is marked by critical acclaim, a devoted following, and a lasting impact on the evolution of Americana and alt-country music.
