## Biography
The Staples Jr. Singers are a family gospel-soul group from Aberdeen, Mississippi, founded in the late 1960s by the Brown siblings—Edward, Annie, and R.C.—when they were still teenagers. Raised in a family of ten children, the Browns began performing together in 1971, inspired by the era’s gospel and soul movements and the social changes sweeping the American South. Their parents, seeking community and solace in the church during a time of ongoing racial tension, encouraged their children’s musical pursuits, which soon became a source of hope and expression for the family and their community. 

The group quickly became a fixture on the Southern gospel circuit, performing at schools, churches, and community events, often playing multiple shows in a single day. Their sound—rooted in gospel but infused with the funk and soul grooves of the 1970s—drew comparisons to their idols, The Staple Singers, and earned them the nickname 'Staples Jr. Singers' from local audiences. In 1975, they recorded their debut album, 'When Do We Get Paid,' a raw and heartfelt collection that reflected both their musical influences and the social realities of their upbringing. After decades of performing and a long hiatus from recording, the group returned to the studio in 2023 to record their second album, 'Searching,' marking a new chapter for the Browns, who now perform with younger generations of their family.

The Staples Jr. Singers’ music is celebrated for its blend of classic soul, gospel, and R&B, with lyrics that address themes of faith, perseverance, and social justice. Their legacy endures not only through their recordings but also through their ongoing performances and the continued involvement of their children and grandchildren, ensuring that their unique sound and message resonate with new audiences.
