## Biography
Eric Gale, born on September 20, 1938, in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, New York, began playing guitar at age 12 and was inspired by sitting in on jam sessions at John Coltrane's home during high school.[1][2][3][5] Despite earning a Master of Science in chemistry from Niagara University, he pursued music full-time, debuting as a session musician in 1961 on Bobby Lewis' 'Tossin' and Turnin',' and soon worked with King Curtis, Jimmy Smith, and others, contributing to over 600 singles and albums across genres like jazz, R&B, and fusion.[1][2][4] In the 1970s, he became CTI Records' go-to guitarist, playing on hits by Grover Washington Jr., Stanley Turrentine, and Bob James, while launching a solo career with albums like *Forecast* (1975) and co-founding the jazz-funk supergroup Stuff.[1][2][3]

Gale's versatility shone in collaborations on major releases, including Roberta Flack's Grammy-winning *Killing Me Softly* (1973), Billy Joel's *52nd Street* (1978), Diana Ross albums like *The Boss* (1979) and *Why Do Fools Fall in Love* (1981), Van McCoy's 'The Hustle' (1975), and Michael Jackson's *Bad* (1987).[1][2][4] He produced and arranged the funky *Negril* album (1975) in Jamaica with Peter Tosh and the Wailers, blending reggae influences, and released eclectic solo works like *Ginseng Woman* (1976) and *Island Breeze* (1983).[1][2][3] His style seamlessly shifted between jazz, funk, soul, and R&B, earning him status as a 'musician's musician.'[1][4]

Gale continued session work into the 1980s and 1990s until his death from lung cancer on May 25, 1994, in Baja, California, at age 55, leaving a legacy of 11 solo albums and unparalleled session contributions over four decades.[1][2]
