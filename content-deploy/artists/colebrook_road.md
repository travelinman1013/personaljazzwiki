## Biography
Colebrook Road is a five-piece string band based in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, known for their original music that blends bluegrass and newgrass styles. The band was formed by founding members Wade Yankey and Jesse Eisenbise, who were introduced through a mutual friend due to their shared love for bluegrass music. Over time, the group expanded to include Joe McAnulty on fiddle, Mark Rast on banjo, and Jeff Campbell on upright bass. Their music is characterized by timeless harmonies and a progressive take on traditional genres, reflecting their growth and maturation over a decade of playing and touring together. Their third full-length album, 'On Time,' released in 2023, showcases their complex arrangements and personal songwriting themes such as love, family, and loneliness. The band's name is inspired by rural roads in Pennsylvania, symbolizing their connection to both traditional and modern sounds. Despite their busy lives with full-time jobs and families, the band members prioritize their music, often touring extensively across the country to perform at festivals like Greyfox in New York. Colebrook Road has been influential in the bluegrass scene in central Pennsylvania, contributing to its growth and popularity in the region.
