## Biography
Jack Maheu (May 1, 1930 – August 27, 2013) was an acclaimed American jazz clarinetist whose career spanned over five decades and left a lasting mark on the Dixieland and traditional jazz scenes. Born and raised in Plattsburgh, New York, Maheu initially studied art at Plattsburgh State College and the Pratt Institute, but his passion for music soon took precedence. He began performing professionally in the early 1950s, recording two albums for Jubilee Records before joining the renowned Dukes of Dixieland in 1957, where he contributed to eight albums and helped with arrangements. After leaving the Dukes in 1959, Maheu led his own band in Chicago, toured with Muggsy Spanier, and collaborated with jazz greats such as Bob Scobey, Jimmy McPartland, Art Hodes, and Pee Wee Russell.

Maheu's career was characterized by versatility and a deep commitment to the jazz tradition. In 1961, he co-led the re-formed Salt City Six, and in the 1980s, he became a fixture at Eddie Condon’s Jazz Club in New York, recording the album 'Condon’s Hot Lunch.' His move to New Orleans in 1990 marked a new chapter, where he quickly became one of the city’s most respected clarinetists, leading bands at Fritzel’s Jazz Pub and forming the Fire In The Pet Shop Callithumpian Jazz Band, which won the New Orleans French Quarter Jazz Festival Battle of the Bands three years in a row. Maheu was celebrated for his expansive, melodic playing style, drawing inspiration from clarinet legends but always expressing a unique voice. He remained active in the New Orleans jazz community until a stroke in 2006 forced his retirement, leaving behind a legacy as both a performer and mentor to younger musicians.
