## Biography
Leonard Cohen (September 21, 1934 – November 7, 2016) was a Canadian singer-songwriter, poet, and novelist whose work is celebrated for its profound lyricism and exploration of themes such as faith, love, loss, and existential despair. Born in Montreal, Quebec, into a middle-class Jewish family, Cohen was immersed in literature and music from an early age, publishing his first poetry collection, 'Let Us Compare Mythologies,' in 1956 while studying at McGill University. Initially gaining recognition as a poet and novelist throughout the 1950s and early 1960s, Cohen transitioned to music in his thirties, a relatively late start compared to his contemporaries.

Cohen's debut album, 'Songs of Leonard Cohen' (1967), introduced his signature blend of folk, pop, and poetic lyricism, featuring enduring tracks like 'Suzanne' and 'So Long, Marianne.' Over the following decades, he released a series of critically acclaimed albums, including 'Songs from a Room' (1969), 'Songs of Love and Hate' (1971), and 'I'm Your Man' (1988), the latter marking a shift toward synthesized production. His song 'Hallelujah,' initially released in 1984, became an international standard through numerous covers. Cohen's music is characterized by its minimalist arrangements, deep baritone voice, and exploration of spirituality, romance, and political themes. Despite periods of personal and financial hardship, including a retreat to a Zen monastery and the loss of his savings to mismanagement, Cohen remained artistically active until his death in 2016, leaving a legacy as one of the most influential songwriters of his era.

Cohen's impact extends beyond his own recordings; he was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame, the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame, and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and received numerous literary and musical honors. His work continues to resonate with audiences and artists worldwide, admired for its depth, honesty, and poetic insight.
