## Biography
Madlyn Davis was an American classic female blues singer active as a recording artist in the late 1920s, remembered primarily for a brief but vivid series of studio sides that placed her among the cohort of so‑called “classic blues” women of the era.[1][2][3][5] Biographical details such as her birthplace, early life, and activities outside the studio are not documented in reliable sources, and even her birth year is given only approximately as 1899 with no confirmed death date.[3] What is known of Davis comes almost entirely from her recordings and the record-company documentation that survives.

Davis emerged during the classic blues boom that had been ignited earlier in the decade by artists like Mamie Smith, Ma Rainey, and Bessie Smith, and she was marketed in the same general vein: a strong-voiced woman fronting small jazz- and blues-oriented studio bands for urban record buyers.[1][4][5] Her sessions show her working in both a straightforward classic-blues idiom and a more raggy, up‑tempo style bordering on jug-band and early hokum, especially on her best‑known titles “Kokola Blues” and “It’s Red Hot,” recorded with her group billed as Madlyn Davis and Her Hot Shots.[1][2][3][6][7] In 1928, near the end of her documented career, she cut four sides accompanied by the guitarist Tampa Red and pianist Georgia Tom Dorsey, musicians who were then shaping the emerging Chicago hokum sound; their presence gives her final recordings a driving, playful character that stands out in later blues scholarship.[6][7] After these 1928 sessions, Davis disappears from the recording ledgers, and no verified information exists about her subsequent life or death, but collectors and historians continue to cite her work as a vivid example of late‑1920s classic blues at the point where it intersected with early hokum and guitar‑driven urban blues.[3][5][6][7]
