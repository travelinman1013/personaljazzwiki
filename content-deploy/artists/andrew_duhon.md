## Biography
Andrew Duhon is a singer-songwriter from New Orleans, Louisiana, whose music blends the storytelling tradition of folk with the soulful melancholy of blues and the rhythmic grooves of his native city. Raised in a Catholic family, Duhon first picked up the guitar as a teenager, initially playing praise and worship music for his school’s campus ministry. A torn rotator cuff ended his baseball aspirations, giving him time to immerse himself in songwriting and the rich musical heritage of New Orleans[1]. His fascination with writers like Emerson, Thoreau, Walt Whitman, and Robert Frost shaped his lyrical approach, infusing his songs with poetic depth and personal reflection[3].

Duhon’s early career was rooted in the French Quarter, where he honed his craft at open mic nights and worked odd jobs to support his passion. He released his debut album, "Songs I Wrote Before I Knew You," in 2008[2]. His partnership with Grammy-winning producer Trina Shoemaker led to three albums, including "The Moorings" (2013), which earned a Grammy nomination for Best Engineered Album[1][2][5]. Subsequent releases like "False River" (2018, produced by Eric Masse) and "Emerald Blue" (2022) showcased his evolving sound and narrative artistry, drawing from personal experiences such as heartbreak and the solace found in nature[1][4][5].

Duhon’s musical style is characterized by a blend of folk, blues, and New Orleans groove, with influences from Delta bluesmen, master songwriters, and the city’s acoustic traditions. His honest songwriting and soulful voice have garnered a dedicated following in the US and Europe, often performing as the Andrew Duhon Trio. His legacy lies in his ability to capture the spirit of New Orleans while pushing its musical boundaries, offering listeners a deeply personal yet universally resonant experience[2][9].
