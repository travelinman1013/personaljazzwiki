## Biography
Domenico Modugno (January 9, 1928 – August 6, 1994) was an Italian singer, songwriter, actor, and later member of the Italian Parliament who became one of the most significant figures in Italian popular music. From a young age, Modugno aspired to be an actor, and after completing his military service in 1951, he enrolled in acting school while simultaneously pursuing a music career. His early work included roles in films and songwriting, with his composition "Lazzarella" (performed by Aurelio Fierro) placing second at the Festival della Canzone Napoletana in 1957, marking his initial rise to prominence.

The turning point of Modugno's career came in 1958 when he co-wrote and performed "Nel blu dipinto di blu" (commonly known as "Volare") with Johnny Dorelli at the Sanremo Music Festival. The song won the festival and became a global phenomenon, selling over 22 million copies and earning Modugno two Grammy Awards—Record of the Year and Song of the Year—making him the first Italian artist to receive Grammy recognition. The song represented Italy at the 1958 Eurovision Song Contest, where it finished third, and was subsequently translated into numerous languages, topping charts worldwide. This success established Modugno as a pioneering Italian cantautore (singer-songwriter).

Following his breakthrough, Modugno achieved sustained success, winning the Sanremo Music Festival again in 1959 with "Piove" ("Ciao, ciao bambina") and placing second in 1960 with "Libero." He won Sanremo for a third time in 1962 with "Addio... addio..." and represented Italy at Eurovision again in 1959 and 1966. Beyond music, Modugno appeared in 44 films and produced two, including "Tutto è musica" (1963), a biographical film about his own life. In his later years, he focused on classical music and modern opera while also becoming increasingly involved in social activism, particularly advocating for improved conditions at the Agrigento psychiatric hospital. He returned to recording in 1992-1993, releasing his final song "Delfini" ("Dolphins") with his son Massimo in 1993.

## Fun Facts
- Modugno reportedly used his earnings from "Nel blu dipinto di blu" to purchase a Ferrari, but the car was totaled in an accident with smashed fenders—an incident later referenced in Allan Sherman's novelty song "America's a nice Italian Name."
- "Nel blu dipinto di blu" was voted as the second favorite song in Eurovision Song Contest history at the 50th anniversary concert in Copenhagen in 2005, decades after its 1958 debut.
- Modugno discovered and became the manager of the Italian comedy duo Franco and Ciccio in 1958, the same year "Volare" became a global hit, helping launch their long-running film career.
- In his final decades, Modugno became a passionate social activist, fighting against inhumane conditions in the Agrigento psychiatric hospital, even holding a benefit concert for former inmates in 1989 before his return to recording in 1992-1993.
