## Biography
Nolatet is a New Orleans-based jazz quartet formed by four acclaimed musicians: vibraphonist Mike Dillon, pianist Brian Haas, bassist James Singleton, and drummer Johnny Vidacovich. The group’s roots run deep in the Crescent City’s musical tradition, with Singleton and Vidacovich having anchored New Orleans’ rhythm sections since the late 1970s, backing legends such as Dizzy Gillespie, Professor Longhair, and James Booker. Dillon and Haas, meanwhile, have been prominent figures in the national jazz and improvisational music scenes, leading and collaborating with groups like Jacob Fred Jazz Odyssey, Garage A Trois, and Dead Kenny Gs. Their paths crossed frequently over decades of touring and performing, culminating in the spontaneous formation of Nolatet after a series of inspired jam sessions and festival appearances.

Nolatet’s music is characterized by fearless improvisation, dynamic interplay, and a willingness to push the boundaries of jazz. Their debut album, 'Dogs' (2016), was recorded in a single day at Esplanade Studios, capturing the raw energy and chemistry of the ensemble with minimal rehearsal and no overdubs. The band’s sophomore release, 'No Revenge Necessary,' further showcased their adventurous spirit, blending funk, swing, and avant-garde elements into a sound that is both rooted in New Orleans tradition and strikingly modern. Each member brings a distinct voice and decades of experience, resulting in a group dynamic that is both playful and profound, irreverent yet deeply respectful of jazz’s legacy.

Nolatet has quickly earned a reputation as one of New Orleans’ most innovative jazz collectives, celebrated for their electrifying live performances and their contributions to the ongoing evolution of the city’s music. Their work exemplifies the spirit of collaboration and reinvention that defines New Orleans jazz, and their influence continues to ripple through the local and national music scenes.
