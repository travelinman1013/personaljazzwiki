## Biography
Rose & The Bros is a dynamic band originating from Ithaca, New York, renowned for their infectious blend of Zydeco and Cajun dance music, enriched with sweet vocal harmonies and a touch of country roots. The group was formed by Rosie Newton, Paul Martin, and Steve Selin, who shared a vision of creating an energetic, dance-driven ensemble. Their mission was to collect tunes and craft the rare ingredients of a no-holds-barred Zydeco and Cajun dance party, ultimately assembling a full six-piece band with the addition of Greg Evans (drums), Angelo Peters (bass), and Sally Freund (rub board and triangle)[2][5][6].

The band’s musical style is deeply rooted in Louisiana dance traditions, but they infuse their sound with elements from Americana, folk, reggae, and country, reflecting the diverse backgrounds of its members. Rosie Newton, a multi-instrumentalist and sought-after session player, brings experience from touring with Zydeco legend Preston Frank and the Canadian folk rock band the Duhks, as well as her acclaimed Old Time duo Richie and Rosie. Paul Martin, a former indie rock musician turned farmer, and Steve Selin, a vital figure in the Ithaca music scene, contribute vocals, guitar, and fiddle. Their rhythm section, featuring jazz educator Greg Evans and genre-spanning bassist Angelo Peters, provides a unique groove that sets the band apart[4][6].

Rose & The Bros released their self-titled debut in 2019, followed by 'It’s Music,' which showcases a broader range of influences and a greater emphasis on original material. The band is celebrated for their commitment to community, joy, and the transformative power of dance, building a devoted following throughout the Northeast and beyond[4][5].
