## Biography
Elmore James (born Elmore Brooks on January 27, 1918, in Richland, Mississippi) was an American blues guitarist, singer, songwriter, and bandleader, widely known as the “King of the Slide Guitar.”[1][3][4] Raised in a sharecropping family and the illegitimate son of Leola Brooks, he began playing a homemade one‑string “diddley bow” before building a multi‑string guitar from a lard can and wood, performing at local gatherings in rural Mississippi.[2][4] As a teenager he played around the Mississippi Delta and, in the late 1930s, began working with Robert Johnson and with Sonny Boy Williamson (Rice Miller) in and around Belzoni, Mississippi, absorbing Johnson’s boogie bass runs and bottleneck slide style that would become the foundation of his own sound.[3][4]

During World War II, James served in the U.S. Navy from 1943 to 1945, returning to Mississippi as a decorated veteran and resuming work both as a musician and at his adopted brother Robert Holston’s radio repair shop in Canton, where he deepened his knowledge of electronic amplification.[2][4] In 1951 he made his recording debut for the Trumpet label in Jackson, Mississippi, cutting “Dust My Broom” with Sonny Boy Williamson on harmonica—a reworking of Robert Johnson’s 1936 song that became a national R&B hit and established his trademark opening slide riff, which he reused in many subsequent recordings.[1][3][4] Across the 1950s and early 1960s he recorded prolifically for labels such as Trumpet, Meteor, Modern, Chess, and Fire, fronting his bands (often called the Broomdusters) in both Mississippi and Chicago and scoring further classics including “The Sky Is Crying,” “I Believe,” and “It Hurts Me Too.”[1][3][4]

James’s style was defined by a raw, urgent vocal delivery and a heavily amplified slide guitar sound marked by dense reverb, dramatic chordal slides, and powerful riff‑based intros, which made him a central figure in the transition from rural Delta blues to modern electric Chicago blues.[1][3][4] Despite chronic heart problems that led to repeated hospitalizations, he remained active on the club and recording circuit until he died of a heart attack on May 24, 1963, at the Chicago home of his cousin and sometime bandmate Homesick James Williamson; his body was returned to Mississippi for burial at Newport Missionary Baptist Church cemetery near Ebenezer.[2][4] Posthumously, his reputation only grew: he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992, and his emotionally charged slide guitar work became a crucial influence on generations of blues and rock musicians.[1][3][5]

## Fun Facts
- Elmore James built one of his earliest multi‑string guitars himself using a lard can as part of the body, after first learning on a one‑string diddley bow.[4]
- He worked in his adopted brother Robert Holston’s radio repair shop in Canton, Mississippi, where he learned about electronics and amplification that later shaped his famously loud slide guitar sound.[2][4]
- James’s signature hit “Dust My Broom” began as a re‑interpretation of Robert Johnson’s 1936 recording, but James’s searing electric slide intro became so iconic that many listeners now associate the song primarily with him.[1][3][4]
- Despite suffering from a longstanding heart condition and multiple heart attacks, he maintained a demanding schedule of club work and recording sessions until his fatal heart attack in 1963 at his cousin Homesick James Williamson’s home in Chicago.[2][4]

## Musical Connections

### Mentors/Influences
- [[robert_johnson|Robert Johnson]] - Principal musical influence; James performed with Johnson in the Mississippi Delta in the late 1930s and closely modeled his slide guitar and boogie bass runs on Johnson’s style, especially Johnson’s original “I Believe I’ll Dust My Broom.” (Robert Johnson’s 1936 recording “I Believe I’ll Dust My Broom,” later reworked by James as “Dust My Broom.”) [Late 1930s; influence continued throughout James’s career.[2][3][4]]
- [[sonny_boy_williamson_ii_rice_miller|Sonny Boy Williamson II (Rice Miller)]] - Collaborator and senior musical associate; James played in Williamson’s bands, appeared on his radio shows, and learned professional bandleading and amplified blues performance in the South before his recording career took off. (Trumpet label sessions including Williamson’s “Eyesight to the Blind” and “Crazy About You Baby,” on which James played guitar.[2][4]) [Late 1930s through early 1950s.[2][3][4]]

### Key Collaborators
- [[sonny_boy_williamson_ii_rice_miller|Sonny Boy Williamson II (Rice Miller)]] - Harmonica player and bandleader with whom James toured, played Southern radio shows, and recorded his debut sessions. (James’s 1951 Trumpet recording of “Dust My Broom,” plus backing Williamson on “Eyesight to the Blind” and “Crazy About You Baby.”) [Circa late 1930s–early 1950s.[2][4]]
- [[johnny_jones|Johnny Jones]] - Chicago pianist who led the Johnny Jones Band; James recorded and performed with this group after moving to Chicago, helping to define his electric ensemble sound. (Sessions for the Bihari brothers’ labels (Modern/Meteor) around 1952 where Elmore James recorded with the Johnny Jones Band.) [Early to mid‑1950s.[2]]
- [[j.t._brown|J.T. Brown]] - Tenor saxophonist who was part of James’s core Chicago band lineup, adding horn arrangements that distinguished many of James’s electric recordings. (Numerous Chicago sessions with the Johnny Jones Band and later Broomdusters sides for labels such as Meteor and Modern.) [Early to mid‑1950s.[2]]
- [[homesick_james_williamson|Homesick James Williamson]] - Cousin and guitarist/bassist who frequently played in James’s bands, including Chicago club dates; Elmore died at his Chicago home. (Club performances such as regular appearances at Sylvio’s in Chicago; Broomdusters lineups featuring Homesick James on bass or guitar.) [Mid‑1950s to early 1960s.[2][4]]
- [[eddie_taylor|Eddie Taylor]] - Chicago guitarist who augmented James’s studio band at key sessions, thickening the guitar texture on some late‑1950s recordings. (Chief Records sessions where Taylor joined James and other guitarists in the studio, reportedly all playing through one amplifier.) [1950s (especially around 1956–1957). [2]]
- [[wayne_bennett|Wayne Bennett]] - Guitarist who took lead roles on some later sessions, interacting with James’s slide work and contributing to more sophisticated arrangements. (Chief Records sessions where Bennett played lead guitar on recordings made after James’s mid‑1950s comeback.) [Mid‑ to late‑1950s.[2]]

### Artists Influenced
- [[muddy_waters|Muddy Waters]] - Fellow Chicago blues icon whose own amplified slide and band sound developed alongside and was shaped by the same electric Delta‑to‑Chicago transition that James helped define; James’s dramatic slide approach contributed to the vocabulary of Chicago blues guitar that Waters popularized. (Muddy Waters’s 1950s Chess recordings (e.g., “I’m Your Hoochie Coochie Man,” “I Just Want to Make Love to You”) reflect the electrified Delta slide aesthetic that James epitomized.) [1950s–1960s and beyond.[3][4] (inferred influence based on shared style and historical accounts)]
- [[eric_clapton|Eric Clapton]] - British blues‑rock guitarist who has cited classic Chicago and Delta slide players, including Elmore James, as key inspirations; Clapton’s slide phrasing and use of James’s standards in his repertoire show direct stylistic influence. (Covers and performances of Elmore‑derived material and slide approaches on early Yardbirds/Bluesbreakers work and solo recordings.) [1960s onward.[3] (inferred from broad scholarly consensus on British blues influences)]
- [[duane_allman|Duane Allman]] - American rock guitarist renowned for slide playing; music historians consistently identify James’s powerful electric slide tone and riffs as central antecedents to Allman’s approach. (Allman Brothers Band recordings such as “Statesboro Blues” (itself an electric slide showcase indebted to earlier Delta and Chicago slide traditions including James).) [Late 1960s–1970s.[3] (inferred influence based on documented slide‑guitar lineage)]
