## Biography
Nayo Jones (pronounced Nīyō or Nigh-Oh) is an American R&B and contemporary R&B vocalist who has established herself as a prominent figure in the New Orleans jazz scene. Born in Chicago, Illinois into a musical family, Jones spent her formative years in Phoenix, Arizona from grammar school through high school before attending Spelman College in Atlanta, Georgia. Her musical foundation was deeply influenced by her father, who is both a musician and music educator specializing in jazz, and who taught her the jazz standards that would become central to her repertoire.

Jones's career took a pivotal turn when she traveled to New Orleans to record an album. Though the original recording project fell through, she discovered the city's renowned music scene and began sitting in with local bands. A chance encounter with legendary New Orleans trumpeter Kermit Ruffins proved transformative - after hearing her perform, Ruffins immediately began booking her for gigs, leading Jones to permanently relocate to New Orleans. This move proved to be a career-defining decision, as New Orleans became her artistic launching pad over the following four and a half years.

As a vocalist, Jones has become known primarily as a jazz singer, though she describes her style as spanning R&B and contemporary R&B genres. Her performances have graced prestigious venues including The Blue Note in New York and The Troubadour in Los Angeles, as well as notable festivals such as the Satchmo SummerFest. Her repertoire includes both original compositions and compelling covers of classics, with 'At Last (Live)' - her rendition of the Etta James standard - standing out as one of her most acclaimed performances. Jones has been performing professionally for over twelve years, with her time in New Orleans representing the most artistically fruitful period of her career.

## Fun Facts
- She never discusses her age publicly, preferring to maintain an air of intrigue about her personal details
- Originally came to New Orleans for a recording project that fell through, but ended up making the city her permanent home within weeks
- Following advice from her musician father, she maintains a strict policy of not dating other musicians to preserve her professional relationships and musical experience
- She no longer plays instruments and focuses exclusively on vocals, though she originally began her musical journey playing flute
