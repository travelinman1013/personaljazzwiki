## Biography
Horace Trahan, a native of Ossun, Louisiana, began his musical journey early, purchasing his first guitar at age twelve and playing saxophone in fifth grade. At fifteen, he learned accordion from his cousin Felix Richard in Cankton, LA, booking his first gig within six months. By sixteen, he was singing Cajun music in French and English, played bass drum in Carencro High School's marching band, and after graduating, toured extensively with D.L. Menard at eighteen, performing in New York, Boston, Chicago, Canada, France, California, and the 1996 Atlanta Olympics.[1][3]

In 1996, at age twenty, Trahan released his debut album *Ossun Blues* on Swallow Records, followed by forming The Ossun Express band (accordion, fiddle, guitar, bass, drums, sometimes triangle), which gained local fame without recording. In 2000, he revamped it as The New Ossun Express and recorded *Get On Board* on Zydeco Hound label; in 2001, *Reach Out and Touch a Hand*, later renamed *That Butt Thing* after its hit single, now owned by Flat Town Music Company. His style blends traditional Cajun with zydeco, Creole, blues, and rock-n-roll, renowned for powerful accordion and vocals.[1][3][4]

Trahan's later career includes successful releases on his own Until The End label: *Keep Walking* (2010), *Christmas In Every Way* (2012), *All The Way* (2017), and the 2013 cover album *By Special Request* on Maison de Soul. A 2013 documentary *Cajun and Creole: Black and White*, produced by his wife Chantelle Trahan, explores his Cajun roots and ties to Creole father-in-law Rodney Bernard. With over 50 years in music, he remains a respected pioneer.[1][3]
