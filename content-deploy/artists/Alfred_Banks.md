## Biography
Alfred Banks is an award-winning rapper and singer from New Orleans, Louisiana, who has emerged as one of the most compelling voices in the city's diverse hip-hop scene. After starting to make a name for himself in the New Orleans music scene over ten years ago, Banks has earned critical acclaim both locally and nationally. His journey to music was unconventional - he struggled with homelessness while attending Loyola University on a full-ride scholarship, ultimately choosing to leave academia behind to pursue MCing full-time.

Banks has been recognized with numerous prestigious awards, including Best Hip-Hop Artist at Offbeat's Best of the Beat Awards and Best Rapper at Gambit's Big Easy Awards. He has been featured prominently by major hip-hop publications including Complex (which named him one of their '10 upcoming New Orleans MCs'), HipHopDx, Okayplayer, and DJBooth's list of Top Indie rappers from Louisiana. His music has reached international audiences through performances at major festivals like Voodoo Festival, Buku Festival, A3C Festival, and SXSW, as well as European venues like Germany's Reeperbahn Festival.

Beyond his musical achievements, Banks is also a mental health advocate who uses his platform to address serious issues. His deeply personal album 'The Beautiful' chronicles his experience dealing with his brother's schizophrenia and death, showcasing his ability to transform personal trauma into powerful artistic expression. The album begins with his brother's funeral and explores Banks' internal struggle between family obligations and career commitments. His song 'UnderDogCentral' was featured in the Netflix film 'Burning Sands,' executive produced by Common, further cementing his place in contemporary hip-hop culture.

## Fun Facts
