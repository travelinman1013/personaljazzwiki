## Biography
Artie 'Blues Boy' White was born on April 16, 1937, in Vicksburg, Mississippi. He began his musical journey singing gospel with the Harps of David at age 11, later joining the Full Gospel Wonders after moving to Chicago in 1956[1][2][3][7]. In Chicago, White became immersed in the vibrant local music scene, initially focusing on gospel before transitioning to blues in the early 1960s—a shift famously attributed to a chance encounter with a well-dressed stranger who offered him $10,000 to record blues music[2].

Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, White recorded singles for independent labels such as P&M, Gamma, and Al Tee, achieving modest chart success with 'You Are My Leanin' Tree' in 1977[1][2]. His breakthrough came with the 1984 album 'Blues Boy' for Ronn Records, which established his reputation as a soulful blues master. White adopted 'Blues Boy' as part of his stage name and went on to release a prolific series of albums on Ichiban and Waldoxy, blending Southern soul and blues with authentic instrumentation, a notable contrast to the synthesizer-driven trends of the era[1][2][6].

Artie White was celebrated for his rich, throaty vocals and commitment to traditional blues and soul, producing nearly a dozen albums over fifteen years and running a blues lounge in Chicago[2][1]. He continued recording and performing until his death on April 20, 2013, leaving a legacy as one of the most respected and influential figures in contemporary Southern soul and blues[1][3][6].
