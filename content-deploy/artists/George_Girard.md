## Biography
George Girard (October 7, 1930 – January 18, 1957) was a prodigiously talented jazz trumpeter from Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, whose career helped define the New Orleans jazz scene of the early 1950s. Girard began studying music under the noted trumpeter Johnny Wiggs while still in high school and turned professional immediately after graduating in 1946. His early career included performances and tours with the bands of Johnny Archer and Phil Zito, experiences that honed his technical skills and exposed him to the evolving jazz landscape.

In 1950, Girard co-founded the Basin Street Six, a band comprised largely of childhood friends, including clarinetist Pete Fountain. The group quickly gained local acclaim, securing a residency at L'Enfant's Restaurant and regular television broadcasts on WWL, which brought them national attention. Despite the band's success, Girard sought greater artistic control and dissolved the group in 1954 to form George Girard & the New Orleans Five, featuring musicians such as trombonist Bob Havens, drummer Paul Edwards, and bassist Bob Coquille. This ensemble became a fixture at the Famous Door in the French Quarter and enjoyed a weekly radio broadcast on WWL, further cementing Girard's reputation for blending traditional New Orleans Dixieland with big-band trumpet stylings.

Girard's career was tragically cut short when he was diagnosed with colon cancer, forcing him to retire from performing in 1956. He died in New Orleans at the age of 26, leaving behind a legacy as one of the most technically gifted and influential jazz trumpeters of his generation. His recordings, though limited, continue to be celebrated for their vibrant energy and innovative approach to New Orleans jazz.
