## Biography
Willie Nelson, born April 29, 1933, in Abbott, Texas, was raised by his musically inclined grandparents after his parents separated during his early childhood. Exposed to gospel music in the local Methodist church and encouraged to play guitar from the age of six, Nelson wrote his first song at seven and was performing with local bands by age ten. His early years were marked by both hardship and a restless creative spirit, which shaped his deep connection to American roots music and storytelling.

After high school, Nelson briefly attended Baylor University before pursuing music full-time, working as a DJ and performing in Texas honky tonks. In the late 1950s, he sold his song 'Family Bible' and moved to Nashville, where his songwriting talents flourished—penning classics like 'Crazy' for Patsy Cline and 'Night Life' for Ray Price. Nelson's own recording career took off in the 1970s when he became a leading figure in the 'outlaw country' movement, challenging Nashville's conventions with albums like 'Red Headed Stranger' and collaborations such as 'Wanted! The Outlaws.'

Nelson's musical style blends classic country, honky tonk, jazz, blues, and folk, characterized by his distinctive phrasing, nasal voice, and the unique sound of his guitar, Trigger. His innovations in songwriting and performance, along with his advocacy for artistic freedom, have left a lasting legacy, influencing generations of musicians and solidifying his place as a cultural icon.

## Fun Facts
- Willie Nelson's guitar, named 'Trigger,' is a Martin N-20 classical guitar that has been his primary instrument since 1969 and is famous for its worn, hole-ridden appearance.
- He is a co-founder of Farm Aid, an annual benefit concert launched in 1985 to support American family farmers.
- Nelson is an avid advocate for marijuana legalization and has his own cannabis brand.
- He once recorded an entire album of reggae music, 'Countryman' (2005), showcasing his eclectic musical interests.
