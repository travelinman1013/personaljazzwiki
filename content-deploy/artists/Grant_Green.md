## Biography
Grant Green was born on June 6, 1935, in St. Louis, Missouri, where he was introduced to music by his guitar-playing father and began performing professionally at just thirteen with a gospel group. Growing up in a city rich with blues and gospel traditions, Green absorbed these influences deeply, which would later become hallmarks of his expressive, blues-infused jazz guitar style. In his early career, he played in local bands and worked with musicians such as Jimmy Forrest and Harry Edison before being discovered by alto saxophonist Lou Donaldson, who encouraged him to move to New York City in 1960.

Once in New York, Green quickly became a prolific figure on the Blue Note Records roster, recording as both a leader and a sideman on more albums than any other artist for the label during the early 1960s. His playing was distinguished by single-note lines and a horn-like phrasing, often eschewing chords in favor of melodic clarity and soulful groove. Green was particularly admired for his work in organ trios and his ability to blend bebop, hard bop, soul jazz, and funk. Despite his immense output and unique voice, Green was often overlooked in his lifetime compared to contemporaries like Wes Montgomery. He died in 1979 at age 43, but his reputation has grown posthumously, with many unreleased recordings surfacing and a new generation of musicians citing him as a major influence.
