## Biography
Joe Bataan, born Bataan Nitollano on November 5, 1942, in Spanish Harlem, New York City, is a pioneering figure in Latin soul, boogaloo, and Latin jazz. The son of an African-American mother and Filipino father, Bataan's early life was shaped by the vibrant and diverse musical landscape of his neighborhood, as well as the challenges of growing up in a tough urban environment. After spending time in prison as a teenager, he emerged with a new sense of purpose and began channeling his experiences into music, drawing on doo-wop, R&B, and Latin rhythms.

In 1966, Bataan formed his first band, the Latin Swingers, and quickly gained attention for his unique fusion of Latin and African-American musical styles. Signing with Fania Records, he released his debut album 'Gypsy Woman' in 1967, which included a Latin dance cover of the Impressions' hit. Over the next several years, Bataan released a string of influential albums that blended energetic Latin dance tracks with soulful English-language ballads, earning him the title 'King of Latin Soul.' His innovative approach helped define the Latin soul genre and influenced the development of salsa and disco. After leaving Fania due to financial disputes, he founded Ghetto Records and later signed with Salsoul Records, continuing to explore new sounds and even recording one of the earliest rap hits, 'Rap-O, Clap-O,' in 1979.

Bataan's legacy endures as a trailblazer who bridged cultural and musical divides, inspiring generations of artists and audiences. After a period of retirement, he returned to performing in the late 1990s and remains celebrated for his contributions to Latin music and his role in shaping the sound and identity of New York's Latin communities.
