## Biography
Walter Brown "Brownie" McGhee (November 30, 1915 – February 16, 1996) was an American folk and Piedmont blues singer and guitarist, best known for his decades-long partnership with harmonica player Sonny Terry.[5] Born in Knoxville and raised in Kingsport, Tennessee, McGhee contracted polio around age four, which left his right leg impaired and earned his brother Granville the nickname "Stick" for pushing him in a cart.[5][2] Their father, George McGhee, was a factory worker and guitarist, and Brownie first played on a homemade guitar fashioned from a tin marshmallow box before moving into local church music and gospel quartets.[5][6] As a teenager he left school to work medicine shows, carnivals, riverboats, and minstrel troupes across Tennessee and the Piedmont region, honing the syncopated, ragtime-inflected guitar style that became his hallmark.[1][3][6]

In the late 1930s McGhee was traveling the Southeast with tent shows and his father’s gospel group when washboard player George “Bull City Red” Washington introduced him to Durham talent scout J. B. Long, who also handled Blind Boy Fuller, McGhee’s guitar hero.[6][3] Long arranged McGhee’s first sessions for Okeh Records in Chicago in 1940, and after Fuller’s death he briefly promoted McGhee as “Blind Boy Fuller No. 2,” while pairing him with Fuller’s harmonica player, Saunders “Sonny” Terry.[2][3][6] Moving to New York in the early 1940s, McGhee and Terry became a formidable duo in clubs, concerts, and on wartime radio broadcasts, later expanding into jump-blues combos and cutting R&B hits such as “My Fault,” which topped the Billboard R&B charts for weeks in 1948.[2][3][6] McGhee also ran the Home of the Blues music school in Harlem from 1942 to 1950, performed in Broadway and off-Broadway productions including Tennessee Williams’s "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof," and appeared in European and Hollywood films.[1][2][3] During the 1960s folk revival, Terry and McGhee toured extensively in the United States and abroad, recording dozens of albums and becoming key conduits between rural Piedmont traditions and new folk and blues audiences.[3][5]

McGhee’s musical style combined the intricate, syncopated fingerpicking of the Piedmont tradition with polished singing and an easy rapport with audiences, allowing him to bridge country blues, urban R&B, and the folk-revival circuit.[2][5][6] He often framed his blues with elements of gospel call-and-response and ragtime harmony, and he was an influential teacher through both his Harlem school and informal mentoring of younger musicians.[2][6] In later years he settled in Oakland, California, continuing to tour widely, record (including the late-career album "The Facts of Life" with Robben Ford), and appear on film until poor health slowed his schedule.[3][2] For his contributions to American vernacular music he received a National Heritage Fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts in 1982, one of the United States’ highest honors in the folk and traditional arts.[2][4] He died in 1996, leaving a legacy as one of the most prominent exponents of the Piedmont blues and as half of one of the most enduring duos in blues history.[2][3][5]

## Fun Facts
- Because he contracted polio as a small child, his brother Granville pushed him in a cart so often that Granville became known as “Stick,” a nickname he kept when he later became the bluesman Stick McGhee.[5][2]
- Brownie’s first guitar was homemade, built from a tin marshmallow box and a piece of board by his uncle, giving him an unconventional start on the instrument he would later master.[5]
- After Blind Boy Fuller’s death, promoter J. B. Long billed McGhee on records as “Blind Boy Fuller No. 2,” a common marketing trick of the time that McGhee and his family disliked.[3][6]
- In addition to his music career, McGhee appeared on Broadway in Tennessee Williams’s “Cat on a Hot Tin Roof” and in films such as the Western "Buck and the Preacher" and French blues documentaries, showing his range as an actor and cultural figure.[1][2][3]
