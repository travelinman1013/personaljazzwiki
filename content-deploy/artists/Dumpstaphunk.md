## Biography
Dumpstaphunk is a New Orleans funk-fusion band that spontaneously formed during the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival in 2003. Born from the legendary Neville and Meters family bloodlines, the band was founded by cousins Ivan Neville (keyboards/vocals, son of Aaron Neville) and Ian Neville (guitar, son of Art "Poppa Funk" Neville), alongside original members Tony Hall (bass/guitar/vocals) and co-founder Nick Daniels III (bass/vocals). The band's name and mission reflect their commitment to modernizing and reinvigorating the influential Neville/Meters family groove for the 21st century.

Over more than two decades, Dumpstaphunk has cemented its reputation as one of the most respected New Orleans musical institutions and the city's pre-eminent 21st-century funk-fusion export. Their signature sound features dueling basslines, complex funk, rock, and jazz arrangements, soulful quadruple harmonies, and Big Easy traditions. The band has released four studio albums, with their most recent, "Where Do We Go From Here," arriving in April 2021 and featuring collaborations with Marcus King, Trombone Shorty, and Chali 2na. Their performances are characterized by ingenious musicianship that ignites a deep, gritty groove, attracting legendary sit-ins from artists like Carlos Santana, Bob Weir, George Clinton, Chaka Khan, Dave Matthews, and members of Phish.

Following the 2024 passing of co-founder Nick Daniels III, the band entered its latest genesis with next-generation additions including Deven Trusclair (drums), Alex Wasily (trombone), Ashlin Parker (trumpet), John Michael Bradford (trumpet), Ari Teitel (guitar), and Viveca Hawkins (vocals). Career highlights include opening for the Rolling Stones at the New Orleans Mercedes Benz Superdome in July 2019 and performing at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival every year since their formation. The band continues to tour internationally, performing at major festivals like Bonnaroo, Lockn Festival, Jam Cruise, and Fuji Rock Festival, maintaining their status as a highly respected live powerhouse.
