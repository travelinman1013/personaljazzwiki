## Biography
Tears for Fears are an English pop rock band formed in Bath, Somerset, in 1981 by Roland Orzabal and Curt Smith. The duo first met as teenagers and began their musical journey together in the mod-influenced ska band Graduate, which released one album before disbanding in 1981. Inspired by Arthur Janov's primal scream therapy and the emotional turmoil of youth, Orzabal and Smith formed Tears for Fears, quickly gaining attention for their introspective lyrics and innovative use of synthesizers. Their debut album, The Hurting (1983), reached number one on the UK Albums Chart and featured hits like 'Mad World' and 'Pale Shelter'. The band's second album, Songs from the Big Chair (1985), catapulted them to international fame with chart-topping singles 'Shout' and 'Everybody Wants to Rule the World', the latter winning the Brit Award for Best British Single in 1986.

Musically, Tears for Fears are known for blending new wave, synthpop, and pop rock, with lyrics often exploring themes of pain, ambition, and personal growth. After Smith left the band in the early 1990s, Orzabal continued under the Tears for Fears name, releasing albums such as Elemental (1993) and Raoul and the Kings of Spain (1995). The duo reunited in 2000 and released Everybody Loves a Happy Ending in 2004, followed by The Tipping Point in 2022, which marked their highest chart peak in decades. Their legacy endures as pioneers of 1980s synthpop and influential figures in the evolution of alternative and pop rock.

## Fun Facts
- The band's name comes from a passage in Arthur Janov's book 'Prisoners of Pain', reflecting their interest in primal scream therapy and emotional expression.
- Their debut album 'The Hurting' was heavily influenced by the childhood traumas of Orzabal and Smith, with lyrics exploring themes of pain and vulnerability.
- Despite being known as a synthesizer group, the song 'Mad World' was originally written on an acoustic guitar by Roland Orzabal when he was just 19 years old.
- After Curt Smith left the band in the early 1990s, Roland Orzabal continued as Tears for Fears, releasing two albums before the duo reunited in 2000.
