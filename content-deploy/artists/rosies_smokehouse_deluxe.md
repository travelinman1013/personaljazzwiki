## Biography
Rosie's Smokehouse Deluxe is a **blues rock** band led by founding member, bassist, and lead vocalist David G. Rose, known as Rosie, who hails from Detroit, Michigan. Growing up in Detroit, Rose was heavily influenced by the Motown sound from a young age, which shaped his musical foundation. After over four decades of performing and recording across the US and Canada, he honed his unique style as a bassist and vocalist, notably working alongside Canadian vocal legend Alex Machin of A Foot in Coldwater fame, becoming part of that Canadian band scene.[1][2][3][5][7]

The band, Rosie's Smokehouse Deluxe, emerged as Rose's dreamchild, blending his Detroit roots with blues rock energy. Their debut album, *Welcome to the Smokehouse*, marked a key milestone, released under MoMojo Records. Based in Wasaga Beach, Canada, the group delivers high-energy performances at festivals like the Orangeville Blues & Jazz Festival, drawing on Rose's extensive road experience with a powerhouse lineup.[1][2][4][6][8]

Rosie's style fuses Motown influences with raw blues rock, characterized by gritty vocals, driving bass lines, and road-tested musicianship. While still building their legacy with low mainstream popularity (Spotify score of 5), the band continues to tour and release music, including tracks like 'Faded Tattoo,' establishing a niche following in the blues scene.[4][6][8]
