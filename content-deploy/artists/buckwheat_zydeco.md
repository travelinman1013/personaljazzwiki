## Biography
Stanley Joseph Dural Jr., known worldwide as Buckwheat Zydeco, was born on November 14, 1947, in Lafayette, Louisiana. Growing up in a Creole household, he was surrounded by zydeco and Gulf Coast music, but initially gravitated toward R&B, funk, and soul. By his teens, he was already a skilled organist, performing with bands and recording for Allen Toussaint. In 1971, he formed Buckwheat and the Hitchhikers, a 15-piece funk and soul band that became a regional sensation. Despite his early resistance to zydeco, Dural’s life changed when he joined Clifton Chenier’s Red Hot Louisiana Band as an organist in 1976. Inspired by Chenier’s energy and the audience’s response, he embraced zydeco and began learning the accordion, forming his own band, Buckwheat Zydeco, in 1979.

Buckwheat Zydeco quickly became the most commercially successful zydeco artist, blending traditional Creole rhythms with contemporary rock, soul, and funk influences. His partnership with manager and producer Ted Fox led to a major-label deal with Island Records in 1986, broadening his reach and introducing zydeco to new audiences. Over his five-decade career, Dural released over 25 albums, earned five Grammy nominations, and won one Grammy. He performed globally, sharing stages with legends like Eric Clapton, U2, Robert Plant, and The Boston Pops, and played at major events including the 1996 Olympics closing ceremonies and President Clinton’s inaugurations. His music was celebrated for its joyful, danceable energy and its role in popularizing zydeco culture.

Buckwheat Zydeco’s legacy is that of a genre ambassador who modernized zydeco without losing its roots. He was known for his dynamic stage presence and his ability to connect with diverse audiences. His work earned him an Emmy for the music in the CBS TV movie *Pistol Pete: The Life And Times Of Pete Maravich*, and his theme song for the PBS series *Pierre Franey’s Cooking In America*. He continued to record and tour until his passing on September 24, 2016, leaving behind a rich musical heritage that continues to inspire.
