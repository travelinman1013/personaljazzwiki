## Biography
Frank Morgan (December 23, 1933 – December 14, 2007) was an American jazz saxophonist whose career spanned over five decades, marked by both early promise and dramatic personal setbacks. Born in Minneapolis, Morgan was raised in Milwaukee by his grandmother before moving to Los Angeles at age 14 to live with his father, Stanley Morgan, a guitarist who played with The Ink Spots. Immersed in the vibrant West Coast jazz scene, Morgan was mentored by legendary music educator Samuel Browne at Jefferson High School and quickly gained recognition for his prodigious talent, performing alongside jazz greats such as Dexter Gordon and Wardell Gray while still a teenager. He made his recording debut in 1953 and released his first album as a leader in 1955, establishing himself as a leading alto saxophonist and a successor to Charlie Parker, whose bebop innovations deeply influenced Morgan’s early style.[1][2][3][4]

Despite his early success, Morgan’s career was derailed for nearly three decades due to struggles with heroin addiction and repeated incarcerations, mirroring the tragic path of his idol, Charlie Parker. During this period, Morgan spent significant time in prison, yet continued to hone his craft, sometimes performing with other incarcerated musicians. His remarkable comeback began in the mid-1980s with the release of 'Easy Living' (1985), after which he recorded prolifically for labels such as Contemporary, Antilles, Telarc, and HighNote. Morgan’s later work was noted for its emotional depth and melodic improvisation, earning him acclaim as a master of bebop and ballads. He became an inspiring figure in jazz, performing internationally and mentoring younger musicians until his death in 2007.[1][3][4][5]

Morgan’s legacy is defined by his resilience, expressive artistry, and his role in bridging generations of jazz musicians. His life story, marked by redemption and perseverance, has been the subject of documentaries and tributes, and his recordings remain influential in the worlds of cool jazz and hard bop.[3][8]
