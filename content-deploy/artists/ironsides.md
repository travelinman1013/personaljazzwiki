## Biography
The Ironsides are a Bay Area retro‑soul and cinematic instrumental group formed by brothers Max and Joe Ramey, both deeply embedded in northern California’s modern soul scene.[2][3][7] Raised in a highly musical household by a professional jazz and classical musician father, the Ramey brothers grew up surrounded by records and styles ranging from jazz and classical to flamenco, bluegrass, Motown, and Muscle Shoals, which laid the foundation for their eclectic but cohesive sound.[1][2] Initially, The Ironsides began as an outlet to play obscure covers and deep cuts—soul jazz, rare groove, and tracks by artists such as Lafayette Afro Rock Band—before evolving into a dedicated project focused on original material that channeled the lush, dramatic feel of late‑1960s and 1970s film scores and instrumental soul.[1]

From the outset, The Ironsides aimed to recreate and reimagine soul music of the late ’60s and early ’70s through a modern lens, blending groove‑heavy rhythm sections with expansive orchestration.[5][7] Spearheaded by Monophonics bassist Max Ramey, the core lineup grew to include his brother Joe, guitarist James (Jamie) Payne, drummer Dan Ford, and arranger Louis Robert King, often joined by Monophonics frontman Kelly Finnigan on keys and vibraphone.[3] Their debut full‑length album *Changing Light*, released on Colemine Records, crystallizes this approach: eight instrumental psych‑soul tracks with sweeping strings, detailed horn arrangements, and tight bass‑and‑guitar interplay that feel like self‑contained movie scenes.[3][5][7][8] Alongside their work as The Ironsides, the Ramey brothers have been key studio and touring musicians, writing, recording, and producing for California soul singer Gene Washington, playing on Kelly Finnigan’s debut album *The Tales People Tell*, serving as members of Monophonics and Kelly Finnigan & The Atonements, and functioning as part of the house band at Transistor Sound Studio.[2]

Musically, The Ironsides draw heavily from rare instrumental soul‑jazz, CTI Records‑era grooves, and European and Ethiopian cinematic sounds, citing influences such as Don Sebesky, Ron Carter, Freddie Hubbard, David Axelrod, Piero Piccioni, and the broader Éthiopiques catalog.[1] Their songs often juxtapose tight, funk‑driven rhythm sections with symphonic strings and brass, evoking big‑budget crime‑film soundtracks and urban dramas while maintaining a distinctly contemporary energy.[1][3][5] Within the modern soul renaissance centered around labels like Colemine, The Ironsides have earned recognition as a “masterful collective” whose richly arranged instrumentals expand the label’s psych‑soul universe and reinforce the Bay Area’s role as a hub for modern retro‑soul and cinematic funk.[3][5][7][8] While their discography is still relatively compact, their work has already cemented them as go‑to collaborators and arrangers in today’s soul scene, with a sound instantly identifiable for its combination of vintage aesthetics, meticulous arranging, and emotive, filmic storytelling without words.[2][3][7][8]

## Fun Facts
- The Ironsides began as a cover project focused on obscure, "deep cut" instrumental soul‑jazz and rare groove tracks—especially CTI Records material and artists like Lafayette Afro Rock Band—before they ever recorded original cinematic pieces.[1]
- Max and Joe Ramey grew up with a professional jazz/classical musician father, while guitarist Jamie Payne’s father was a flamenco guitarist; this mix of jazz, classical, flamenco, ska‑punk, bluegrass, Motown, and Muscle Shoals all feeds subtly into the band’s sound.[1]
- Before releasing their own debut LP, the Ramey brothers had already become in‑demand behind‑the‑scenes players, serving as the main rhythm section and songwriters for Kelly Finnigan’s debut album and producing California soul singer Gene Washington.[2]
- On their track "The Web" from *Changing Light*, the band reportedly spent multiple days refining a single main groove, obsessively balancing the instruments to achieve the tight, era‑perfect yet personal feel they were chasing.[1]

[Influence discovered and absorbed primarily in the years leading up to The Ironsides’ formation and early recordings (2010s).]
