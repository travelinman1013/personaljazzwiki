## Biography
The Meters are an American funk band formed in 1965 in New Orleans, Louisiana, by Art Neville (keyboards/vocals), George Porter Jr. (bass), Leo Nocentelli (guitar), and Joseph 'Zigaboo' Modeliste (drums). Art Neville, already a prominent figure in New Orleans R&B, assembled the group, which quickly became central to the city's vibrant music scene. Their early years saw them performing as the house band for Allen Toussaint's Sansu Enterprises, backing artists such as Lee Dorsey and Dr. John, and developing their signature sound rooted in tight grooves, syncopated rhythms, and melodic interplay[1][2][3][4].

Throughout the late 1960s and 1970s, The Meters released influential tracks like "Cissy Strut," "Look-Ka Py Py," and "Chicken Strut," which are now considered funk classics. Their music blended New Orleans 'second line' rhythms with soulful funk, helping to define the genre nationally. Despite limited mainstream chart success, their innovative style made them sought-after collaborators for artists including Paul McCartney, Robert Palmer, Labelle, and The Rolling Stones, who invited them to open on major tours[1][2][3]. The band underwent lineup changes in the late 1970s, with Art and Cyril Neville departing to form The Neville Brothers, while other members became prominent session musicians and bandleaders in their own right[1][2][3].

The Meters' legacy is profound: they are regarded as originators of funk alongside James Brown, influencing countless musicians across genres. Their work has been recognized with multiple Rock and Roll Hall of Fame nominations and a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2018[1][3]. The band has periodically reunited under various names, including The Funky Meters, continuing to inspire new generations of artists with their groundbreaking sound.
