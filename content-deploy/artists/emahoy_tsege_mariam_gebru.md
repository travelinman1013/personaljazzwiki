## Biography
Emahoy Tsegué-Maryam Guèbrou (born Yewubdar Gebru, December 12, 1923 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia – March 26, 2023) was an Ethiopian composer, pianist, and nun of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, known by the honorific title Emahoy and the religious name Tsegué-Maryam. Born into an aristocratic family—her father Kentiba was a diplomat and later mayor of Gondar—she and her sister Senedu were among the first Ethiopian girls to be educated abroad, attending a boarding school in Basel, Switzerland from age six. There she studied violin and piano, giving her first recital at age 10. After returning to Ethiopia, she worked briefly in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and played her compositions for Emperor Haile Selassie. The Italian invasion of Ethiopia in 1936, which led to her family’s imprisonment and exile and the deaths of three brothers, profoundly shaped her life; she later chose monastic life, spending about a decade in a remote northern Ethiopian monastery before returning to Addis Ababa to resume composing and teaching.

Emahoy’s music is a deeply personal fusion of Ethiopian sacred and folk traditions, European classical piano (especially Romantic and fin de siècle parlor styles), gospel, and jazz idioms. Her compositions draw on Ethiopian kignits such as tizita (longing), anchihoye, bati, and ambassel, while also reflecting her studies of Saint Yared’s sixth-century liturgical music and her exposure to Western classical and jazz in Switzerland and Cairo. In the 1960s she recorded her first albums in Germany—Spielt Eigene Kompositionen and Der Sang des Meeres—with support from Emperor Haile Selassie and her brother-in-law, using the proceeds to support homeless orphans (yekolo temari). Though sometimes loosely associated with Ethio-jazz, her introspective, lyrical piano works resist easy categorization. Over her lifetime she composed over 150 works for piano, organ, and chamber ensembles, dedicating her music rights and legacy to the Emahoy Tsege Mariam Music Foundation in Washington, D.C., which continues her charitable work for children.

## Fun Facts
- Emahoy and her sister Senedu were the first Ethiopian girls to study abroad, sent to a Swiss boarding school in Basel at age six.
- She gave up all her worldly possessions—including her name, hair, shoes, and beloved piano— when she entered a remote monastery in northern Ethiopia, only resuming her musical career after returning to Addis Ababa about ten years later.
- She composed over 150 works for piano, organ, opera, and chamber ensembles, and donated all her music rights (including unpublished works) to the Emahoy Tsege Mariam Music Foundation in Washington, D.C., to support underprivileged children.
- Though her music is sometimes grouped with Ethio-jazz, writer Ted Gioia noted that 'There is no genre for funky Ethiopian nuns,' highlighting her resistance to easy categorization.
