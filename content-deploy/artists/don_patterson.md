## Biography
Don Patterson (July 22, 1936 – February 10, 1988) was an American jazz organist born in Columbus, Ohio. He began playing piano as a child, drawing heavy influence from Erroll Garner, whose style shaped his early musical flavor. At age 20, around 1956, he switched to organ after being inspired by Jimmy Smith, marking a pivotal shift in his career toward the Hammond B-3 organ[2][3][5][6][7].

Patterson developed a reputation for his exceptionally quick bebop lines, excelling in genres like hard bop, soul jazz, and bebop. He moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where he spent much of his professional life and eventually passed away. Active primarily in the 1960s and 1970s, he recorded numerous albums as a leader for labels like Prestige and Blue Note, showcasing his virtuosic organ technique in trio and quartet settings typical of soul jazz[1][2][6].

Though not as widely recognized as some contemporaries, Patterson's legacy endures through his contributions to organ jazz, blending bebop speed with soulful grooves. His work remains influential among jazz organ enthusiasts, with reissues keeping his catalog accessible[1][6].
