## Biography
Jalacy "Screamin' Jay" Hawkins (July 18, 1929 – February 12, 2000) was an American singer, songwriter, and actor renowned for his powerful, operatic vocal style and flamboyant, theatrical performances. Born in Cleveland, Ohio, Hawkins spent his early years in an orphanage before being adopted. He showed prodigious musical talent from a young age, teaching himself piano and reading music by age six. Originally aspiring to be an opera singer, inspired by Paul Robeson and Mario Lanza, Hawkins shifted to blues and R&B after finding limited opportunities for Black opera singers in the mid-20th century.[1][2][3][5]

After serving in the U.S. Army during World War II, where he entertained troops, Hawkins returned to music and briefly pursued a boxing career, even becoming the middleweight boxing champion of Alaska in 1949. His musical breakthrough came in the early 1950s, working with artists like Tiny Grimes and Fats Domino. In 1956, Hawkins recorded his most famous song, "I Put a Spell on You," in a session fueled by heavy drinking, resulting in a wild, voodoo-inspired performance that became a hit and established his reputation as an early pioneer of shock rock. Encouraged by DJ Alan Freed, Hawkins developed a macabre stage persona, complete with coffins, skulls, and outlandish costumes, which made him a cult figure in the U.S., Europe, and Japan.[1][2][3][4]

Hawkins continued to tour and record through the 1960s and 1970s, especially in Europe, and appeared in films such as "Mystery Train" and "A Rage in Harlem." His influence extended far beyond his own recordings, as his theatrical style and vocal delivery paved the way for later shock rock and performance artists. Hawkins died in France in 2000, leaving behind a legacy as one of rock and roll's most original and outrageous performers.[1][2][3][4][5]

## Fun Facts
- Hawkins originally intended "I Put a Spell on You" as a ballad, but the final, raucous version was recorded after a night of heavy drinking, and he claimed not to remember the session.[1][4]
- He often performed on stage emerging from a coffin and used props like skulls and bones, making him a pioneer of shock rock theatrics.[1][2][4]
- Hawkins was a successful amateur boxer, winning a Golden Gloves championship and becoming the middleweight boxing champion of Alaska in 1949.[2][3][5]
- His wild stage persona led some organizations, including the NAACP, to criticize his act for perpetuating negative stereotypes, even as he gained cult status in the U.S. and abroad.[1][4]
