## Biography
The Dave Brubeck Quartet was formed in 1951 by pianist Dave Brubeck following a serious spinal injury in Hawaii that forced him to adapt his playing style toward chunky, block-style chords. Born December 6, 1920, in Concord, California, Dave Brubeck initially formed the quartet with alto saxophonist Paul Desmond, bassist Bob Bates, and drummer Joe Dodge. The group quickly established themselves with a residency at San Francisco's Black Hawk nightclub and gained tremendous popularity touring college campuses, recording influential live albums like Jazz at Oberlin (1953) and Jazz Goes to College (1954).

The quartet's classic lineup was solidified in 1958 with the addition of drummer Joe Morello and bassist Eugene Wright, creating what became known as the "classic era" of the group that lasted through 1967. This configuration made possible the rhythmic experiments that would define their sound. Their breakthrough came with the 1959 album Time Out, which featured unusual time signatures like 9/8, 6/4, and 5/4 in compositions entirely written by quartet members. Despite initial critical skepticism, Time Out became the first jazz album to sell over a million copies and peaked at number two on the Billboard 200.

The quartet's innovative approach to rhythm and time signatures, combined with Desmond's lyrical alto saxophone and Brubeck's distinctive block chord style, established them as pioneers of cool jazz. Their willingness to experiment with complex meters in accessible ways brought jazz to mainstream audiences, particularly through college tours and the iconic track "Take Five." Brubeck's commitment to racial integration was demonstrated when he canceled numerous concerts in the South and a television appearance rather than exclude African-American bassist Eugene Wright from performances.

## Fun Facts
- Dave Brubeck was embarrassed when he appeared on the cover of Time Magazine in November 1954, becoming only the second jazz musician to receive this honor after [[01_Projects/PersonalArtistWiki/Artists/Louis_Armstrong]], because he felt [[Duke_Ellington]] deserved it more.
- The quartet's famous album Time Out was initially met with hesitation from Columbia Records, but was released in December 1959 with support from company president Goddard Lieberson and featured distinctive cover art by S. Neil Fujita.
- Brubeck canceled a 25-date tour of colleges and universities in the American South in January 1960 because 22 of the schools refused to allow African-American bassist Eugene Wright to perform.
- The spinal injury that led to the quartet's formation occurred while Brubeck was surfing in Hawaii in 1951, requiring three weeks in traction and leaving him with permanent nerve damage that affected his playing style for the rest of his career.
