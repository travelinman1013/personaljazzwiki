## Biography
Chubby Checker, born Ernest Evans on October 3, 1941, in Spring Gully, South Carolina, and raised in South Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, is a pioneering American rock and roll singer and dancer best known for popularizing the Twist dance craze. As a teenager, he honed his musical and performance skills, eventually earning the nickname 'Chubby' in high school and later 'Chubby Checker'—a playful nod to Fats Domino—thanks to Dick Clark's wife[1][2].

Checker's career took off after signing with Cameo-Parkway Records in 1959. His 1960 cover of Hank Ballard's 'The Twist' became a cultural phenomenon, reaching No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 twice and sparking a worldwide dance craze that transcended generations. He followed this with further hits such as 'Let's Twist Again,' which won him a Grammy Award, 'Pony Time,' and 'Limbo Rock,' each introducing new dance styles to mainstream audiences. Checker’s energetic performances and dance-centric songs made him a household name and a symbol of the early 1960s dance craze era[2][3][4].

Over his career, Checker placed 32 songs on the Billboard Hot 100, with seven reaching the Top Ten, and sold over 250 million records. His enduring influence on pop culture and music was recognized with his induction into the National Rhythm & Blues Hall of Fame in 2014 and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2025. Checker remains active in music, continuing to perform and inspire new generations of artists and fans[3][4][5][6].
