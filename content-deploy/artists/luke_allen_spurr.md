## Biography
Luke Spurr Allen, born in Salinas, California, grew up in a family with some musical presence; his father played piano, his sister Dawn pursued music on clarinet and bassoon, and another sister Sylvia gifted him his first guitar. He showed early creative tendencies, writing rhyming couplets and stories as a child, and played trumpet and piano before focusing on guitar in college. After finishing school in 1993, he worked in Alaska on cannery and logging jobs, then traveled south, intending for New Mexico but arriving in New Orleans around 1993-1994 by chance, where he found a sense of space and community that suited his introspective nature.[1][5]

Allen became a fixture in the New Orleans music scene over two decades, founding and fronting the Happy Talk Band, known for roots rock that resonated post-Hurricane Katrina. The band released *Total Death Benefit* (2004), *There There* (2007), and *Starve A Fever* (2010), winning Big Easy Awards for best roots rock band in 2007 and another year. His songwriting blends dark, thoughtful themes with wry humor, drawing from Americana, folk, country, and rock. He worked as a bartender at venues like Circle Bar (from ~2001), Angeli, Abbey, and co-owns Siberia Bar with his wife Meghann; life events like having a child paused releases until his solo debut *Pothole Heart* in 2017, featuring local talents.[1][2][3][4]

Residing in New Orleans' Holy Cross neighborhood with his family, Allen's music captures a 'dark and wry atlas' of dystopian introspection, influenced by his solitary childhood imagination and bar life observations, as in the song 'Sweet Vermouth,' a decades-long bartending manifesto.[1][2]

## Fun Facts
- Ended up in New Orleans 'by mistake' after traveling from Alaska in 1993, bypassing intended destination New Mexico because it didn't appeal during a period he felt spiritually guided.[1]
- Song 'Sweet Vermouth' took nearly two decades to write, serving as his 'bartending manifesto' about a man possibly trapped in a bar or hell with ghosts.[1]
- As a child, stood between his dramatically singing father and off-key mother at church, which 'drove him batty,' amid a musically inclined family.[1]
- Happy Talk Band gained loyalty post-Katrina as one of few roots rock groups gigging in early recovery days.[1]
