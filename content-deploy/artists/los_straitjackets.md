## Biography
Los Straitjackets are an American instrumental rock band formed in Nashville, Tennessee, in 1994 by guitarists Danny Amis (aka 'Daddy-O Grande') and Eddie Angel, along with drummer Jimmy Lester and bassist E. Scott Esbeck. The group originally began as the Straitjackets in 1988, but after a brief hiatus, they reformed with a new visual identity—donning colorful Mexican wrestling masks—and a renewed focus on the 'lost art of the guitar instrumental.' Their debut album, 'The Utterly Fantastic and Totally Unbelievable Sound of Los Straitjackets,' was released in 1995, quickly establishing them as leading figures in the surf rock and retro-instrumental revival scene[1][2][3].

Drawing inspiration from surf rock pioneers like Link Wray, Dick Dale, the Shadows, and the Ventures, Los Straitjackets developed a distinctive style blending surf, rockabilly, garage rock, and touches of punk. Their energetic live shows, marked by humor and theatricality, helped them build a devoted following. Over three decades, the band has released more than a dozen studio albums, collaborated with artists such as Nick Lowe and blues legend Eddy 'The Chief' Clearwater, and toured extensively in the US and abroad. Their work has earned critical acclaim, including a Grammy nomination for their collaboration with Clearwater in 2003[1][2][3].

Despite lineup changes and personal challenges—such as Danny Amis’s battle with multiple myeloma—the band has remained active, continuing to record and tour. Their masked personas and commitment to instrumental excellence have made them icons in the modern surf and roots rock landscape, influencing a new generation of musicians and keeping the spirit of classic guitar-driven rock alive[2][3].
