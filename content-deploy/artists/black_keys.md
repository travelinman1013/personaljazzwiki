## Biography
The Black Keys are a celebrated American rock duo formed in Akron, Ohio, in 2001 by childhood friends Dan Auerbach (vocals, guitar) and Patrick Carney (drums). Both grew up in Akron and began playing music together as teenagers, eventually dropping out of college to pursue their passion. Their early recordings were famously raw and self-produced, often laid down in Carney’s basement, which gave their debut album, 'The Big Come Up' (2002), a gritty, lo-fi edge that set them apart in the burgeoning garage rock revival of the early 2000s.

Over the next decade, The Black Keys built a devoted following through relentless touring, frequent album releases, and a sound that fused blues, rock, and garage influences. Albums like 'Thickfreakness' (2003) and 'Rubber Factory' (2004) solidified their underground reputation, while their move to Nonesuch Records and collaboration with producer Danger Mouse on 'Attack & Release' (2008) brought a more polished sound and wider acclaim. Their commercial breakthrough came with 'Brothers' (2010) and 'El Camino' (2011), both earning multiple Grammy Awards and spawning hits like 'Tighten Up' and 'Lonely Boy.' After a brief hiatus from 2015 to 2019, the duo returned with new material, continuing to evolve their sound while paying homage to their blues roots.

The Black Keys are known for their distinctive blend of blues rock, garage rock, and modern blues, drawing inspiration from Mississippi hill country blues and classic rock acts. Their legacy is marked by a commitment to authenticity, a DIY ethos in their early years, and a significant influence on the 21st-century rock landscape, inspiring a new generation of musicians to embrace raw, soulful sounds.
