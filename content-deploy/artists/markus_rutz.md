## Biography
Markus Rutz is a Chicago-born jazz trumpeter, composer, and bandleader whose career spans over three decades. He began playing trumpet at the age of nine and pursued formal studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Berklee College of Music, and the University of New Orleans, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts. Returning to Chicago, Rutz gradually established himself through performances in bars, restaurants, and eventually prominent clubs and concert venues, developing a signature bluesy, soulful trumpet sound often described as 'gorgeous.'

Rutz is known for his original compositions and arrangements, frequently leading ensembles that showcase both his music and the talents of musicians from Chicago, New York, and his formative years in New Orleans. His discography includes seven albums as a leader, with notable releases such as 'Blueprints Figure One: Frameworks' (2019), which was featured on NPR’s Morning Edition and considered for a Grammy nomination, and its follow-up 'Blueprints Figure Two: New Designs' (2020). His work has received critical acclaim, international radio play, and recognition from outlets like Jazz Weekly and Chicago Jazz Magazine. In 2023, he released 'Storybook,' a concept album reflecting personal and universal narratives.

Rutz's musical style blends modern jazz with elements of blues, swing, bop, and Latin influences, often incorporating Cuban percussion and West Coast Cool. He is also an educator and composer-in-residence for The Rose Theatre Co. in Washington, DC, and continues to perform, compose, and collaborate with top musicians worldwide, contributing significantly to Chicago’s vibrant jazz scene.
