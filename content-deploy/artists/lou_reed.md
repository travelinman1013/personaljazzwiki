## Biography
Lou Reed (Lewis Allan Reed, born March 2, 1942, Brooklyn, New York – died October 27, 2013) was an American musician, songwriter, and poet whose career spanned five decades. Growing up in Long Island, Reed developed an early interest in music, singing in a doo-wop group during high school before attending Syracuse University, where he studied under the poet Delmore Schwartz. After college, Reed worked as a songwriter for Pickwick Records, which led to his meeting John Cale and the formation of the Velvet Underground in 1965. The band, managed by Andy Warhol, became a fixture of New York's avant-garde scene and released four albums that, though commercially overlooked at the time, are now regarded as foundational to underground and alternative rock.

After leaving the Velvet Underground in 1970, Reed embarked on a prolific solo career, releasing over twenty studio albums. His second solo album, 'Transformer' (1972), produced by David Bowie and Mick Ronson, brought him mainstream recognition, especially with the hit 'Walk on the Wild Side.' Reed's solo work continued to push boundaries, exploring themes of urban life, sexuality, addiction, and alienation with a poetic sensibility and deadpan vocal delivery. Albums like 'Berlin,' 'Rock 'n' Roll Animal,' and 'New York' showcased his willingness to experiment with glam rock, art rock, and proto-punk styles, cementing his reputation as a chronicler of marginalized lives and outsider experiences.

Reed's legacy is immense: he is celebrated for his literary lyricism, experimental guitar work, and fearless engagement with taboo subjects. His influence extends across genres, inspiring generations of musicians in punk, indie, and alternative rock. Reed continued to write, perform, and collaborate until his death in 2013, and his induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame underscores his status as one of the most innovative and influential figures in modern music.
