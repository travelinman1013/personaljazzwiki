## Biography
Safi Abdullah is a Jamaican roots reggae drummer and singer, born Stuart Bennett in May Pen, Clarendon, Jamaica, where he began playing drums as a youth in local groups before moving into the professional Kingston scene.[2] In his early career he joined respected Trinidadian‑Jamaican bandleader and guitarist Lynn Taitt, gaining experience in the studio and on stage as rocksteady evolved into reggae and deepening his understanding of classic Jamaican rhythm section craft.[2] Through the 1970s he became active as a session drummer and band member, contributing to the island’s roots movement and gradually developing his own voice as a singer and songwriter alongside his instrumental work.[2]

By the late 1970s Abdullah had stepped forward as a recording artist, cutting the socially conscious roots set **“Another One Gone”**, originally released around 1979 and later reissued on CD by Shanachie, with guitarist Andy Bassford among the featured players.[1][2] His music draws on traditional **roots reggae** with strong Rastafarian and cultural themes, emphasizing live band interplay, meditative grooves, and reflective lyrics rather than dancehall‑style electronics.[2][4] Although he has remained a relatively low‑profile figure internationally, he is recognized in reggae circles as a veteran drummer‑singer who bridges classic roots traditions and later generations; events such as the Reggae Culture Salute have highlighted him as a "veteran drummer/singer" alongside younger artists, underscoring his continuing presence and quiet legacy within Jamaican music.[3]
