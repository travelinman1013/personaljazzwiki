## Biography
Meryl Zimmerman, originally from Long Island, New York, began singing jazz during her high school years and has continued for over two decades, now in her 40s as of 2023. She pursued formal training in jazz vocal performance at the Manhattan School of Music, where she earned a Masters of Music degree. After completing her studies, Zimmerman relocated to New Orleans, where she has resided for a decade, establishing herself as a dynamic jazz vocalist known for her warm, expressive style and vast repertoire of popular and lesser-known songs.[1][2][4][6]

In New Orleans, Zimmerman has built a multifaceted career as a performer and educator. Since Fall 2019, she has taught jazz vocal lessons privately and at institutions like the Jewish Community Center. She performs regularly in the local scene, captivating audiences with her vocal jazz interpretations, and was a finalist in the Stage Door Idol competition. Her work reflects a deep commitment to jazz traditions while offering private voice lessons to aspiring singers.[1][4][5]

Zimmerman's legacy is rooted in her role as a 'walking library' of songs, preserving and performing a wide array of jazz standards. Based in New Orleans, she continues to contribute to the vibrant jazz community through live performances and teaching, blending her Long Island roots with Southern jazz heritage.[2][4]
