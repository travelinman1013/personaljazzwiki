## Biography
Firehouse Five Plus Two was a pioneering American Dixieland jazz band formed in the late 1940s by a group of Disney animators and artists, led by trombonist Ward Kimball. The group began informally, with lunchtime jam sessions at Disney Studios, where Kimball and pianist Frank Thomas discovered a shared passion for jazz. Their musical camaraderie soon attracted other Disney colleagues, and the group evolved from casual gatherings to performing at studio parties and local events. The band’s name was inspired by Kimball’s restored 1916 American LaFrance fire engine and the fact that the ensemble consisted of seven members, hence 'Five Plus Two.'[1][2][5][7]

The Firehouse Five Plus Two quickly gained popularity in Southern California during the late 1940s and 1950s, performing at nightclubs, dances, and even Disneyland, all while maintaining their day jobs at Disney. Their energetic performances, playful stage presence, and authentic Dixieland sound made them a sensation. The band recorded extensively for the Good Time Jazz label, helping to revive interest in traditional jazz during an era dominated by other musical trends. Their lineup featured notable Disney figures such as Danny Alguire (cornet), Harper Goff (banjo), Clarke Mallery (clarinet), Monte Mountjoy (drums), Ed Penner (bass saxophone), and Frank Thomas (piano).[1][3][7]

The group’s legacy is significant both in jazz and animation history. They bridged the worlds of music and animation, influencing later generations of musicians and animators alike. Their recordings remain a testament to the enduring appeal of classic jazz, and their whimsical approach to performance helped popularize the genre for new audiences. The Firehouse Five Plus Two is remembered as much for their musical talent as for their unique origin story within the creative environment of Walt Disney Studios.[1][2][4]
