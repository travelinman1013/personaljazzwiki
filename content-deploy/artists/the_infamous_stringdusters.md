## Biography
The Infamous Stringdusters are a Grammy Award-winning American bluegrass band formed in the mid-2000s in Nashville, Tennessee. The group emerged onto the scene with their 2006 self-titled EP and quickly gained attention with their debut full-length album, 'Fork in the Road,' released in 2007 on Sugar Hill Records. Comprised of Andy Hall (Dobro), Andy Falco (guitar), Chris Pandolfi (banjo), Jeremy Garrett (fiddle), and Travis Book (double bass), the Stringdusters distinguished themselves with their virtuosic musicianship and a progressive approach that blended traditional bluegrass with elements of Americana, jam band improvisation, and groove-oriented arrangements.[2][3][4][5][6]

From the outset, the band was committed to forging a long-term musical partnership, with members bringing experience from professional bluegrass ensembles but seeking to push the genre's boundaries. Their innovative sound and energetic live performances quickly earned them accolades, including three International Bluegrass Music Association (IBMA) awards in 2007: Album of the Year, Song of the Year, and Emerging Artist of the Year. Over the years, the Stringdusters have continued to evolve, releasing numerous albums and winning the Grammy Award for Best Bluegrass Album in 2018. Their collaborative songwriting process and relentless touring have helped them build a dedicated fanbase and a reputation as one of the most influential acts in modern bluegrass.[1][2][3][4][5]

The Stringdusters' legacy lies in their ability to honor bluegrass traditions while simultaneously expanding its horizons. Their music is marked by intricate instrumental interplay, tight harmonies, and a willingness to experiment with form and genre. They have played major festivals, collaborated with a range of artists, and inspired a new generation of acoustic musicians, solidifying their place as torchbearers for progressive bluegrass.
