## Biography
Willie Lewis (born William T. Lewis on June 10, 1905, in Cleburne, Texas) was an influential American jazz clarinetist and bandleader whose career bridged continents and eras. Growing up in Dallas, Lewis began performing in variety shows as a teenager, quickly establishing himself as a talented musician. He pursued formal musical education at the New England Conservatory of Music, which laid the foundation for his future endeavors in jazz.

Lewis's early professional years were spent playing with Will Marion Cook's orchestra, which later came under the direction of Sam Wooding. With Wooding, Lewis toured extensively across Europe, South America, and North Africa, gaining exposure to international audiences and musical styles. After Wooding's orchestra disbanded in 1931, Lewis formed his own ensemble, Willie Lewis and His Entertainers, recruiting many of Wooding's former musicians. The band achieved notable success in Europe, recording for the French label Disques Swing and featuring prominent jazz artists such as Benny Carter, Bill Coleman, Herman Chittison, Garnet Clark, Bobby Martin, and June Cole. Their performances and recordings contributed to the spread of American jazz in Europe during the interwar period.

In 1941, Lewis disbanded the Entertainers and returned to New York City, where his musical activity waned. He occasionally performed and found work as an actor, but ultimately his fortunes declined, leading him to take up bartending. Despite a quieter later life, Lewis's legacy endures through his pioneering role in bringing jazz to European audiences and his collaborations with some of the genre's most respected musicians.
