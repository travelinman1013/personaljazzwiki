## Biography
The Love Experiment is a genre-blurring, future-soul collective formed in Boston in 2010 and now based in New York City. The group was initially assembled by drummer Charles “Blvk Samurai” Burchell, with core members Kim Mayo (lead vocals), Parker McAllister (bass), Andrew Burglass (guitar), Jessi Lee (saxophone), Devon Dixon Jr. (keys), and Syl DuBenion (vocals/saxophone). The band members met while attending prestigious institutions such as the New England Conservatory, Berklee College of Music, and Harvard University, coming together first for a Black History Month concert at Harvard. Their first unofficial show, however, was a warehouse party where the energy and audience response convinced them to become a permanent group.

The Love Experiment’s music is a vibrant fusion of hip-hop, jazz, R&B, soul, and funk, reflecting influences from artists like J Dilla, Flying Lotus, Erykah Badu, Radiohead, Doobie Powell, and Robert Glasper. Their debut self-titled album, released in late 2016, showcased their creative range with tracks that blend dreamy melodies, intricate grooves, and socially conscious lyrics. The group is known for their electrifying live performances and collaborative spirit, often working with other artists in New York’s underground scene. Their follow-up album, 'Velvet,' continues their exploration of genre, incorporating analog synths, drum machines, and live groove sessions to create a sound that is both nostalgic and forward-thinking.

The Love Experiment has built a reputation as progressive representatives of a new generation of soul music, frequently collaborating with Grammy-winning artists and dynamic MCs. Their work is characterized by a willingness to experiment with sound and theme, particularly the complexities of love, which is central to their identity and creative output.
