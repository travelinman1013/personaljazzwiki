## Biography
The War and Treaty is an American husband-and-wife duo formed in 2014 by singer-songwriters Michael Trotter Jr. and Tanya Trotter, blending soul, gospel, blues, Americana, and country in their music. They met in 2010 at a Maryland music festival, instantly connecting despite different backgrounds: Tanya, raised near Washington, D.C., had early success as a teenager in R&B with a Billboard Hot 100 song and later worked as a church worship leader to support her son, while Michael, who grew up in Houston, Texas, served two tours in Iraq as an Army soldier, where he was wounded and self-taught piano in Saddam Hussein's palace, beginning his songwriting career by honoring fallen comrades.[1][2][3][4]

Their career took off with the 2017 EP *Down to the River*, followed by critically acclaimed debut album *Healing Tide* (2018) and *Hearts Town* (2020), which featured guests like Emmylou Harris. Signing with Mercury Nashville/UMG in 2022, they released major-label debut *Lover's Game* (2023) and collaborated on Zach Bryan's 'Hey Driver,' reaching top 20 on Billboard Hot 100. Pioneers as the first Black duo nominated for CMA and ACM Duo of the Year (2023-2024), they earned Grammy nods for Best New Artist and an Emmy for NFL Titans work in 2025, with an upcoming biopic.[1][2][4]

Based in Nashville, their style draws from Ike and Tina Turner soul to bluegrass redemption themes, earning acclaim for passionate live shows alongside legends like Chris Stapleton and Al Green, and recognition from Americana Music Association as 2022 Duo/Group of the Year.[1][3][5]
