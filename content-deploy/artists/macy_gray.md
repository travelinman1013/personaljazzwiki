## Biography
Natalie Renée McIntyre, known professionally as Macy Gray, was born on September 6, 1967, in Canton, Ohio, to a math schoolteacher mother and a steelworker stepfather. Bullied for her high-pitched, awkward voice during childhood, she became withdrawn, avoiding public speaking until around age ten, but found solace in music, starting classical piano lessons at seven and immersing herself in jazz influences like Billie Holiday, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, and James Brown. A bicycle accident led her to adopt the stage name 'Macy Gray' from a mailbox she saw. She attended multiple high schools, including a boarding school from which she was expelled for behavior, and later studied scriptwriting at the University of Southern California (USC), where she initially wrote songs for others.[1][2][3]

Gray's music career began serendipitously at USC when she recorded demos herself after a singer no-showed, sparking her passion. She performed jazz standards at LA hotels, opened her own café 'The Wee Ours' with open mics, and worked jobs like cashier and production assistant while demoing songs. Signed by Atlantic Records' Tom Carolan in 1994 for her debut 'Thing of Beauty,' she was dropped when he left, but A&R executive Jeff Blue signed her to Zomba in 1997. Her breakthrough came with the 1999 album *On How Life Is*, blending hip-hop, funk, jazz, pop, and rap, led by the Grammy-winning single 'I Try,' which peaked at #5 on the Billboard Hot 100. Known for her raspy, Billie Holiday-influenced voice, she has released ten studio albums and acted in films like *Training Day* and *The Paperboy*.[1][2][3][4]

Gray's legacy endures through her distinctive neo-soul/R&B sound and Grammy success, maintaining a popularity score of 61 on Spotify. Her autobiographical songwriting and genre fusion have influenced subsequent artists, while her acting roles and resilient career—overcoming label drops and personal challenges—cement her as a versatile icon.[1][4]
