## Biography
Low Strung is a pioneering cello ensemble founded in 2006 by Yale University orchestra alumni, including co-founder Dan Lewis. Conceived as a way to bring the cello into new musical territory, the group set out to break down the traditional boundaries between classical and popular music. Their unique approach involves arranging and performing iconic rock and pop songs—ranging from Queen and The Beatles to Lady Gaga and Beyoncé—exclusively for twelve cellos, transforming the instrument into a vehicle for high-energy, genre-crossing performances.

From its inception, Low Strung has grown into a celebrated ensemble, performing at prestigious venues such as the Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland and Las Vegas’s Aria Resort and Casino, as well as touring internationally in Thailand, Singapore, Costa Rica, and China. The group is known for its technical virtuosity, dynamic showmanship, and its mission to inspire new generations of musicians to see the cello in a new light. Their performances and educational outreach have helped bridge the gap between classical tradition and contemporary popular culture, earning them acclaim from audiences and critics alike.

Low Strung’s legacy is rooted in its innovative spirit and commitment to musical excellence. By reimagining the cello as a rock instrument, the ensemble has not only expanded the instrument’s repertoire but also inspired countless young musicians to explore new possibilities. Their enduring presence at Yale and on international stages continues to influence the next generation of cellists and music lovers.
