## Biography
Jack White is an American musician and producer born in Detroit, Michigan, who rose to prominence as the guitarist, vocalist, and primary songwriter of the White Stripes, a garage rock duo he formed with Meg White in 1997. The band achieved international fame with their 2001 breakthrough album White Blood Cells, establishing White as a key figure in the 2000s garage rock revival. Beyond the White Stripes, White demonstrated his versatility by founding additional rock groups including the Raconteurs and the Dead Weather in the latter half of the 2000s, while simultaneously pursuing a solo career that began in 2012 with his self-produced debut album Blunderbuss, which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart.

White's career is characterized by his prolific output across multiple musical projects and his willingness to collaborate with diverse artists spanning genres from rock to R&B to folk. His production work and songwriting have earned him critical acclaim and Grammy recognition, while his establishment of Third Man Records has positioned him as an influential figure in the music industry beyond his own performances. White's gritty, blues-influenced approach to rock music and his distinctive aesthetic have made him one of the most recognizable figures in contemporary rock.
