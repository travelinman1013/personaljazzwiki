## Biography
The Dixie Cups were a pioneering American girl group from New Orleans, Louisiana, active primarily in the 1960s. The original trio consisted of sisters Barbara Ann Hawkins and Rosa Lee Hawkins, along with their cousin Joan Marie Johnson. They began singing together in grade school and initially performed locally under the name The Meltones. In 1963, they were discovered at a talent show by singer and producer Joe Jones, who became their manager and introduced them to the legendary songwriting and production team Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller in New York City. Leiber and Stoller signed the group to their newly formed Red Bird Records, where they were renamed The Dixie Cups—a nod to their New Orleans roots. Their debut single, 'Chapel of Love,' written by Phil Spector, Ellie Greenwich, and Jeff Barry, became a massive hit in 1964, knocking the Beatles off the top of the charts and selling over a million copies. The group followed up with other notable hits such as 'People Say,' 'You Should Have Seen the Way He Looked at Me,' and their sprightly rendition of the New Orleans standard 'Iko Iko.'

The Dixie Cups' musical style blended doo-wop harmonies with pop and R&B influences, reflecting the vibrant New Orleans sound of the era. After their initial success, the group moved to ABC-Paramount in 1966 but did not achieve further chart-topping hits. The Hawkins sisters continued to perform with various replacements for Joan Marie Johnson, including Dale Mickle and later Althelgra Neville. The group has remained active in touring and personal appearances, earning recognition such as the Pioneer Award from the Rhythm & Blues Foundation in 2003 and induction into the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame in 2007. Their legacy endures as one of the most influential girl groups of the 1960s.
