## Biography
Uri Caine, born on June 8, 1956, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to Temple Law School professor Burton Caine and poet Shulamith Wechter Caine, began playing piano at age seven and studied with French jazz pianist Bernard Peiffer starting at age 12. He later attended the University of Pennsylvania, where he studied under composer George Crumb, deepening his classical music knowledge while performing in Philadelphia clubs. After moving to New York City in the 1980s, Caine made his recording debut in 1985 with the Rochester-Gerald Veasley band and his solo debut in 1992, quickly gaining recognition through collaborations with jazz artists like Don Byron and Dave Douglas.[1][2][3]

Caine's career is defined by his innovative fusion of jazz improvisation with classical repertoire, reworking composers such as Gustav Mahler, Bach, Beethoven, Wagner, Schumann, and Mozart across 16 classical albums, including the award-winning 1997 Mahler tribute from the German Mahler Society. He has explored diverse projects like the drum 'n' bass-infused Bedrock with Zach Danziger, the funk-jazz Philadelphia Experiment with Questlove and Christian McBride, and John Zorn's Masada compositions on Moloch: Book of Angels Volume 6. Notable residencies include Composer-in-Residence for the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra (2005-2009), Mannes College (2013-2014), and a United States Artists Fellowship in 2010; in 2019, he released an oratorio on Octavius Catto.[1][2][7]

Caine's musical style blends free jazz, classical, klezmer, post-bop, Philly soul, and avant-garde elements, often incorporating DJ culture and electronica, earning him performances with orchestras worldwide and a reputation for transforming classical music through improvisation. His legacy endures through boundary-pushing recordings and live collaborations, influencing contemporary jazz-classical hybrids.[1][6][7]
