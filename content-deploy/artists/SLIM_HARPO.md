## Biography
Slim Harpo, born James Isaac Moore (sometimes cited as Isiah Moore) on February 11, 1924, in Lobdell, Louisiana, was a pivotal figure in American blues, renowned as a leading exponent of the swamp blues style. Growing up in Port Allen, just across the Mississippi River from Baton Rouge, Harpo was immersed in a vibrant regional blues scene that shaped his musical sensibilities. He began performing in Baton Rouge bars in the mid-1950s under the name 'Harmonica Slim,' often accompanied by his brother-in-law, Lightnin’ Slim. To avoid confusion with another artist, he adopted the stage name Slim Harpo, a nod to his mastery of the harmonica, or 'harp.'

Harpo's recording career took off after being discovered by producer Jay Miller, leading to his debut single "I'm a King Bee" in 1957. His music, characterized by a laconic, loping beat, tremolo-laden guitar, and laid-back vocals, was both accessible and deeply rooted in Southern blues traditions. Harpo achieved major commercial success with hits like "Rainin' in My Heart" (1961) and "Baby Scratch My Back" (1966), the latter reaching number one on the R&B chart and crossing over to the pop Top 20. Despite his success, Harpo never became a full-time musician, maintaining a trucking business to support his family. His songs were widely covered by British Invasion bands such as The Rolling Stones and The Kinks, helping to bridge the gap between rural American blues and international rock audiences.

Harpo's influence extended well beyond his own recordings, as his adaptable, good-time blues style resonated with musicians across genres. He continued to tour and record through the 1960s, even reuniting with Lightnin’ Slim for a series of performances aimed at rock audiences. Plans for his first European tour and recording sessions in London were cut short when he died suddenly of a heart attack on January 31, 1970, in Baton Rouge. Today, Slim Harpo is remembered as one of the most commercially successful and influential blues artists of his era, with a legacy that endures in both blues and rock music.
