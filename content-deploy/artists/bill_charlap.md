## Biography
Bill Charlap, born in New York City in 1966, was immersed in music from an early age as the son of Broadway composer Moose Charlap and acclaimed singer Sandy Stewart. He began playing piano at age three, studying both classical and jazz traditions, and attended New York’s High School of Performing Arts. Rather than completing college, Charlap chose to hone his craft through performance, quickly becoming a sought-after accompanist and collaborator in the jazz world.

Charlap’s career accelerated in the 1990s, when he joined Gerry Mulligan’s band and later the Phil Woods Quintet, working with jazz luminaries such as Benny Carter, Tony Bennett, and Clark Terry. In 1997, he formed the Bill Charlap Trio with Peter Washington (bass) and Kenny Washington (drums), a group now recognized as one of jazz’s premier ensembles. Renowned for his sensitive and imaginative interpretations of the American Songbook, Charlap has released numerous acclaimed albums, including Grammy-nominated works like 'Somewhere: The Songs of Leonard Bernstein' and 'Live at the Village Vanguard.' In 2016, he won a Grammy for 'The Silver Lining: The Songs of Jerome Kern' with Tony Bennett.

Beyond performance, Charlap has shaped jazz education and curation as Artistic Director of the Jazz in July Festival at 92NY and as Director of Jazz Studies at William Paterson University. He is also known for frequent collaborations with his wife, pianist Renee Rosnes, and his mother, Sandy Stewart, further cementing his legacy as a leading interpreter and advocate for jazz and the Great American Songbook.
