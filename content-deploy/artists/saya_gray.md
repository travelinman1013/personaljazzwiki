## Biography
Saya Marion Murata Gray is a Toronto-born singer, producer, and multi-instrumentalist who emerged as a distinctive voice in experimental pop and indie music.[1][3] Born to a Japanese mother—founder and director of Discovery Through the Arts, one of Toronto's largest independent music schools—and Scottish-Canadian father Charlie Gray, an accomplished jazz trumpeter who performed with legends like Ella Fitzgerald, Aretha Franklin, and Tony Bennett, Gray was immersed in music from infancy.[1][4] She began piano lessons immediately and received extensive ear training as a child, quickly becoming a virtuoso across multiple instruments.[4][7] By age nine, she had a bass in her hands, and within a few years was gigging professionally on Toronto's jazz scene, subbing for adult musicians while still a teenager.[5] Gray's early career saw her touring internationally as a bass player and musical director for Grammy Award-winning neo-soul artist Daniel Caesar and alt-pop innovator Willow Smith, while simultaneously absorbing diverse genres including jazz, hip-hop, R&B, and gospel.[1][3]

After signing what she describes as a "bad record deal" in her early twenties that resulted in her music being held up for several years, Gray reclaimed her narrative in 2022 by releasing "19 MASTERS," a collection of demos recorded largely through her iPhone's Voice Notes app.[1][5][6] The EP, which TIME dubbed one of the best albums of the year, introduced her dissonant electro-rock sound to the world and earned critical acclaim from The New York Times, Pitchfork, and NPR.[1] She followed with two additional EPs—"QWERTY I" (2023) and "QWERTY II" (2024)—before preparing her official debut album, *SAYA*, for release on February 21, 2025.[1] The album represents a significant artistic evolution, moving from experimental sketches toward cohesive melodic folk songcraft influenced by the Beatles, Led Zeppelin, and Canadian folk icon Joni Mitchell.[1] Gray created much of the material during a transformative period in autumn 2023, when she traveled to Japan and embarked on a cross-country road trip following the end of a troubled relationship, carrying an acoustic guitar to capture inspiration.[1] Recorded at Toronto's Revolution Recording, *SAYA* features intricate production with kotos, harps, modular synths, and pedal steel guitars, with each track densely layered with production details that reveal new dimensions upon repeated listening.[5]

Gray's artistic identity is shaped by her multicultural heritage and childhood experiences as one of few Japanese people in Toronto's east end during the early 2000s, experiences that informed her later exploration of her family history, including discovering that her great-grandmother was a performer during Japan's Edo period.[5] Now 29 years old, Gray has performed at major festivals including the Montreal Jazz Fest, Pitchfork Music's Paris festival, and Primavera Sound in Spain.[1] Her work is characterized by genre-defying experimentation, vulnerable songwriting, and meticulous compositional craft—qualities that have made her difficult to categorize as either instrumentalist or vocalist, with many considering her voice itself her most affecting instrument.[3]

## Fun Facts
- Gray was featured in the Toronto Star for her 'distinct and sassy' sense of style at the 2013 Beaches Jazz Festival, and she has stated that her BN5 bass 'matches every outfit' and is 'the most versatile bass I've ever played.'[5][2]
- Some of the demos that became her debut EP '19 MASTERS' were recorded when Gray was just 15 years old, and she released them as-is without the original producer after escaping a restrictive record deal.[6]
- Gray describes herself as 'hyper-intuitive' with extrasensory perception from childhood, possessing perfect pitch and composing music from a very young age; people noted she had the demeanor of 'a 40-year-old woman' as a child, holding intense eye contact and observing people carefully.[2]
- Gray did not have a traditional childhood home—she grew up living in her mother's music school, which functioned as both a residence and educational institution, with no separate bedrooms for the family.[6]
