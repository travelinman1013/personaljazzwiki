## Biography
Zydeco Force was established in 1988 in Opelousas, Louisiana, founded by Robby "Mann" Robinson on bass and Jeffery Broussard as lead accordionist and vocalist.[1][2] Originally formed in the spirit of rural, old-time zydeco style, the band evolved over time to incorporate funkier, contemporary influences, blending traditional zydeco rhythms with R&B and soul elements.[7] This innovative approach positioned Zydeco Force at the forefront of the nouveau zydeco movement throughout the late 1980s and 1990s, making them instrumental in modernizing zydeco music and dance for a new generation of Creole musicians and audiences.[1][4]

During their approximately 18-19 years together, Zydeco Force became an iconic presence on the zydeco scene, gaining significant visibility through appearances on Don and Charles Cravins' weekly television program "Zydeco Extravaganza," which helped introduce their hip, contemporary sound to broader audiences.[4] The band's success demonstrated that zydeco could evolve while maintaining its cultural roots, providing a template for how traditional Creole music could incorporate modern influences without losing its authenticity. Their work during this period helped expand zydeco's reach beyond traditional Louisiana communities and influenced how the genre would develop in subsequent decades.[1]

After nearly two decades of collaboration, Zydeco Force disbanded, prompting Jeffery Broussard to pursue a solo career focused on returning to traditional zydeco roots.[3] The band's legacy remains significant in zydeco history as pioneers of the nouveau zydeco movement who successfully bridged the gap between tradition and innovation, influencing countless musicians who followed and helping to ensure zydeco's continued relevance in contemporary music.

## Fun Facts
- Jeffery Broussard taught himself to play accordion by sneaking his father Delton's accordion out of the closet whenever he could, eventually mastering all the instruments in his father's band before accordion became his favorite.
- Zydeco Force gained significant mainstream visibility through appearances on Don and Charles Cravins' weekly television program 'Zydeco Extravaganza,' which helped introduce their contemporary sound to audiences beyond traditional Louisiana communities.
- The band's innovative approach of blending traditional zydeco rhythms with R&B and soul elements was so influential that it helped modernize zydeco dancing in the 1990s and established a new standard for how the genre could evolve.
- After Zydeco Force disbanded, Jeffery Broussard deliberately returned to his roots, focusing on traditional Creole music rather than the contemporary nouveau zydeco style he had pioneered, demonstrating a full-circle career trajectory.
