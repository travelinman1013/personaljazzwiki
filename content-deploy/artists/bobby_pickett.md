## Biography
Robert George Pickett (February 11, 1938 – April 25, 2007), known professionally as Bobby "Boris" Pickett, was an American singer-songwriter and comedian, best remembered for his 1962 novelty hit "Monster Mash." Born in Somerville, Massachusetts, Pickett was exposed to horror films early in life thanks to his father's job as a movie theater manager. This childhood fascination with classic horror greatly influenced his later work, particularly his signature impersonations of Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi.

After serving in the U.S. Army during the Korean War, Pickett moved to Hollywood in the early 1960s with aspirations of becoming an actor. While seeking acting roles, he performed with local bands such as The Cordials and Darren Bailes and the Wolf Eaters, where his Karloff impression became a crowd favorite. Encouraged by bandmate Leonard Capizzi, Pickett co-wrote "Monster Mash" as a parody of contemporary dance crazes. The song, produced by Gary S. Paxton and featuring musicians like Leon Russell and Mel Taylor, became a number one hit on the Billboard Hot 100 in October 1962 and has since become a perennial Halloween classic, re-charting multiple times over the decades.

Though Pickett never replicated the massive success of "Monster Mash," he continued to record novelty songs, make television and film appearances, and even hosted a monster-themed radio show. He published his autobiography, "Monster Mash: Half Dead in Hollywood," in 2005. Pickett died of leukemia in 2007, but his legacy endures as the creator of one of pop culture's most enduring holiday songs.
