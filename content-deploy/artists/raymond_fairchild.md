## Biography
Raymond Fairchild (1939–2019) was an American banjo virtuoso and bandleader whose explosive picking and hybrid "Fairchild style" made him a legend of Appalachian and bluegrass music. Born in Cherokee, North Carolina, to a Cherokee mother and a father often away on military duty, he grew up in a deeply musical family and first played guitar around age eleven before turning seriously to the banjo as a young man.[2][3][7] His first banjo was a homemade fretless instrument with a squirrel‑hide head; when his father later bought him a Gibson banjo and metal picks in Asheville, Fairchild initially wore the picks backwards, an early sign of the unorthodox technique that would become his hallmark.[2] He absorbed influences from jukebox records of Earl Scruggs, Don Reno, Snuffy Jenkins, and other pioneering banjo players, as well as from the blues songs he heard as a boy from Black chain‑gang prisoners working roadside crews, whose lonesome singing left a lifelong imprint on his music.[2][3]

By the mid‑1960s Fairchild had moved from Cherokee to Maggie Valley, North Carolina, where he began playing publicly at the Hillbilly Campground, often performing seven days a week from morning until midnight for tips while also working as a stonemason to support his growing family.[3] In this period he formed his first bands, sometimes with musicians such as Roy Mull, Frank Buchanan, Wilford Messer, and Buck Duncan, and was eventually recruited by “Uncle Jim” O’Neal to record for Rural Rhythm Records, producing a string of albums that mixed mountain music, bluegrass, honky‑tonk country, and even drums, saxophone, and steel guitar in bold experiments rarely attempted on the banjo.[3] His break onto the national stage came around 1970 via a connection with Nat Winston, who arranged an informal Grand Ole Opry audition; Fairchild’s high‑velocity renditions of pieces like “Whoa Mule” and “Orange Blossom Special” stunned the backstage crowd, leading to Opry appearances and later television exposure on “Hee Haw.”[3] Over the following decades he became a fixture of the bluegrass circuit, recording more than twenty albums, earning two gold records for million‑selling releases, winning five World Champion Banjo Player titles, and performing many times at the Grand Ole Opry.[1][2]

Fairchild’s playing drew on bluegrass, early mountain music, and the blues, yet he insisted it was neither old‑time nor strictly bluegrass, calling it simply “Fairchild style” — a fiercely rhythmic, extremely fast, and highly melodic approach that showcased tremendous right‑hand power and precision.[2][3][5] Half Cherokee and proud of his heritage, he wove stories of Southern Appalachia into his performances and became closely identified with Maggie Valley, where he and his wife Shirley owned and operated the Maggie Valley Opry House for more than thirty years and where he regularly appeared with his Maggie Valley Boys.[1][2] Honors included induction into the Society for the Preservation of Bluegrass Music in America (SPGMA) Hall of Greats in 1989, recognition in the Bluegrass Hall of Fame and the Bill Monroe Bluegrass Hall of Fame, and a town welcome sign proclaiming Maggie Valley as the “Home of Raymond Fairchild.”[1][2] Remembered for his dry humor offstage, his quiet, motionless stage presence, and the sheer impact of his banjo sound, Fairchild played for over six decades until his death at age 80 in Maggie Valley on October 13, 2019, leaving a lasting legacy in Appalachian and bluegrass music.[1][2][7]

## Fun Facts
- Fairchild’s first banjo was a fretless instrument with a squirrel‑hide head, and when he later bought metal fingerpicks he initially wore them backwards before eventually flipping them around, an early quirk that foreshadowed his unconventional approach.[2]
- As a child, he would sneak close to Black chain‑gang road crews during their meal breaks to listen to them sing the blues; the haunting sound of those songs became a deep thread in his later banjo style.[2][3]
- During his early Maggie Valley days, Fairchild sometimes played from 8 a.m. until midnight seven days a week for tips by the roadside, all while working as a stonemason to support his family.[3]
- At his first Grand Ole Opry appearance, Fairchild both brought down the house with his banjo playing and reportedly walked onstage with a loaded .38 revolver in his pocket, explaining simply that “there’s a lot of meanness in this world.”[3]

- [[don_reno|Don Reno]] - Important banjo influence whose inventive, driving style informed Fairchild’s own high‑energy approach. (Heard primarily via jukebox and records; no specific shared projects documented.) [Youth and early playing years, 1950s–1960s.[2]]
- [[snuffy_jenkins|Snuffy Jenkins]] - Another formative banjo influence Fairchild heard on records while developing his technique. (Recordings encountered on jukeboxes in Asheville; no direct collaboration documented.) [Youth and early adulthood, 1950s–1960s.[2]]

- [[crowe_brothers|Crowe Brothers]] - Vocal and instrumental group that backed Fairchild for roughly fifteen years, helping define his stage sound before they eventually split off on their own. (Live and recorded work as Fairchild’s primary backing band; later referenced in interviews about his transition to fronting Raymond Fairchild & the (New) Maggie Valley Boys.) [Approximately late 1970s–early 1990s (timeframe indicated in retrospective coverage).[6]]
- [[jimmy_cox|Jimmy Cox]] - Banjo builder with whom Fairchild co‑designed a limited‑edition banjo model. (Cox/Fairchild Banjo, produced in runs of 100 gold‑plated and 100 nickel‑plated instruments.)

### Artists Influenced
- [[regional_appalachian_and_bluegrass_banjo_players_collective|Regional Appalachian and bluegrass banjo players (collective)]] - Fairchild’s extremely fast, blues‑inflected "Fairchild style" and decades of performances at the Maggie Valley Opry House inspired numerous younger banjoists and touring bluegrass musicians, who cite his speed, power, and showmanship as benchmarks. (Influence reflected broadly in contemporary North Carolina and Appalachian bluegrass scenes; later tributes emphasize his impact rather than specific derivative albums.[2][5][8]) [Primarily 1970s–2010s, as his recordings and live shows circulated widely.]
