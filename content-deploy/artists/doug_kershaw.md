## Biography
Doug Kershaw, born January 24, 1936, in Tiel Ridge, Cameron Parish, Louisiana, is a pioneering American fiddle player, singer, and songwriter renowned for his energetic performances and deep roots in Cajun music. Raised in a French-speaking Cajun family, Kershaw did not learn English until the age of eight, by which time he had already mastered the fiddle and was teaching himself to play a remarkable 28 instruments. His early exposure to Cajun music came from family gatherings on a houseboat, and his first public performance was at a local bar, accompanied by his mother on guitar.

Kershaw's professional career began in 1948 with his brothers Rusty and Peewee in the Continental Playboys, later narrowing to the successful duo Rusty & Doug. The pair achieved national attention in the 1950s and early 1960s, selling over 18 million records and performing on the Grand Ole Opry and Louisiana Hayride. After Rusty & Doug disbanded, Doug launched a solo career, breaking into mainstream pop and country with hits like "Louisiana Man" and "Diggy Liggy Lo." His 1969 appearance on The Johnny Cash Show and the broadcast of "Louisiana Man" from the Apollo 12 lunar mission cemented his status as an ambassador for Cajun music.

Kershaw's musical style is a vibrant blend of traditional Cajun, country, and zydeco, marked by his virtuosic fiddle playing and high-energy stage presence. His influence on American music is profound, bridging cultural gaps and inspiring generations of musicians to explore Cajun traditions. Inducted into the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame in 2009, Kershaw remains a celebrated figure in both Cajun and country music circles.
