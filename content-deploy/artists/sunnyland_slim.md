## Biography
Albert Luandrew, known professionally as Sunnyland Slim, was born near Vance, Mississippi, likely on September 5, 1906 or 1907. Raised in the heart of the Mississippi Delta, he began his musical journey playing organ in local churches and quickly developed a passion for blues, teaching himself piano and performing at parties and barrelhouses by age eleven. In his teens, he worked as a silent film organist and, by 1925, had moved to Memphis, where he became immersed in the vibrant Beale Street scene, performing with legends such as Ma Rainey and Blind Blake.

Sunnyland Slim relocated to Chicago in the late 1930s, where he became a central figure in the city's burgeoning blues scene. His powerful, percussive piano style and commanding vocals defined the Chicago blues sound, and he became a prolific recording artist, amassing a catalog of over 250 songs between 1947 and 1985. More than just a performer, he was a mentor and connector, helping launch the careers of artists like Muddy Waters and collaborating with many of the genre's greats. Despite never achieving mainstream stardom, he remained a beloved and constant presence in Chicago's clubs for decades, earning recognition as a patriarch of the Chicago blues.

Sunnyland Slim's legacy endures through his influence on generations of blues musicians and his unwavering dedication to the music. He was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame and received a National Heritage Fellowship, cementing his status as a foundational figure in American blues history.
