## Biography
Joseph Kamga is a Cameroonian guitarist and songwriter who emerged from the vibrant music scene of Yaoundé in the 1970s. Born and raised in Cameroon, Kamga was deeply influenced by the rich cultural heritage of his homeland, particularly the traditions of the Bamiléké people. His early exposure to local rhythms and melodies shaped his unique approach to music, blending indigenous sounds with contemporary genres.

Kamga gained recognition for his 1974 single 'Sie Tcheu,' a Jerk tune sung in Bamiléké, which showcased his skill as a guitarist and his commitment to preserving and modernizing traditional Cameroonian music. Recording under challenging conditions—often in makeshift studios with minimal equipment—Kamga and his peers contributed to a dynamic underground scene that left a lasting legacy of raw, innovative grooves. His work was released by the French label Sonafric, which played a crucial role in distributing Cameroonian music internationally during that era[2][3].

Though not widely known outside specialist circles, Kamga's contributions are celebrated among collectors and enthusiasts of African funk and garage music. His recordings, marked by energetic guitar lines and a fusion of local and global influences, continue to be rediscovered and appreciated for their historical and artistic value.
