## Biography
Mamadou. is a Harlem-based spoken word artist, rapper, songwriter, producer, and filmmaker of Malian heritage, known for blending poetry, hip-hop, and neo‑soul into deeply narrative, emotionally vulnerable work.[1][2][3] Born and raised in Harlem, New York, to a family from Bamako, Mali, he grew up as a first‑generation Malian American navigating life in a marginalized community while rooted in Islamic faith, an experience that would become central to his artistic voice.[2][3] He has described poetry as his "first love" and his earliest access point to the arts, a way to document the realities he saw from his apartment window and to serve as a kind of historian for a misunderstood community.[1][3] In middle school, a seventh‑grade English teacher introduced him more seriously to poetry, helping him see writing as a space where he could merge fantasy and reality to depict both his neighborhood and people’s internal states, solidifying his identity as a storyteller.[2]

As he moved from Harlem to high school, Mamadou. began experimenting with music alongside his writing, releasing a mixtape by his senior year and gradually expanding into production, learning piano and guitar and working in Logic Pro.[3] In college he focused more intently on music, crafting his debut project *To Stitch a Rose* with close collaborators Donovan Simpson and Krishna Canning, a 2019 release that framed his experiences as a first‑generation Malian man, his relationship to religion, and young adulthood through what he calls chord‑ and melody‑driven, stream‑of‑consciousness lyricism.[3] Over subsequent years he honed a genre‑bending sound that fuses spoken word, soulful and neo‑soul textures, hip‑hop, and cinematic storytelling, with critics like Kazi Magazine praising him for "carrying the torch of Tupac’s philosophy" in how he depicts the Black perspective in America.[2] His work consistently centers Black empowerment, Islamic spirituality, mental health, love, and healing across the Black diaspora, and he has simultaneously developed as a filmmaker, releasing short films and visual pieces that extend his world‑building beyond audio alone.[1][2][3]

Now in his mid‑twenties, Mamadou. describes himself foremost as a storyteller committed to intentional, vulnerable writing that amplifies marginalized voices and creates space for young Black men to feel secure in emotional expression.[1][2][3] He envisions a multifaceted career that includes publishing poetry collections and books, producing and songwriting for other artists, and sustaining a platform where poetry, music, and visual art intersect as tools for therapy and self‑discovery.[3] With an expanding catalog of spoken word pieces, songs, and short films, and with growing recognition on platforms like Spotify’s Fresh Finds, he is steadily building a legacy as one of a new generation of artists using narrative craft and formal experimentation to bridge the gaps between diasporic identity, spirituality, and contemporary Black life.[1][2][3][4][6]
