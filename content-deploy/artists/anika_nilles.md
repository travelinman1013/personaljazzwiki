## Biography
Anika Nilles, born on May 29, 1983, in Aschaffenburg, West Germany, is a renowned German drummer, composer, and musical educator celebrated for her technical precision and innovative approach to rhythm. Raised in a musically rich family—her father, two uncles, and a cousin were all drummers—she began playing drums at age six, initially taught by her father. After a period working in social education, Nilles pursued her passion for music full-time, earning a degree in popular music from the Popakademie Baden-Württemberg in Mannheim.

Nilles launched her professional career in the early 2010s by sharing original drum compositions on YouTube, quickly gaining international attention for her energetic grooves and complex, genre-blending style. Her music, an inventive mix of urban jazz, modern funk, progressive rock, and pop, is characterized by emotional depth and rhythmic intricacy. She has released several albums with her band Nevell, including 'Pikalar' (2017), 'For a Colorful Soul' (2020), 'Opuntia' (2022), and 'False Truth' (2025), and has toured extensively across Europe, North America, and Asia.

Beyond her solo work, Nilles is a sought-after educator and clinician, teaching at institutions such as Drumeo (Canada), Nexus ICA (UK), and serving as head of drums at Popakademie Baden-Württemberg. She joined Jeff Beck's live band for a 2022 tour and, in 2025, was announced as the drummer for Rush's 2026 reunion tour, cementing her legacy as one of the most influential drummers of her generation.
