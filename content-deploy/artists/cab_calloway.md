## Biography
Cabell "Cab" Calloway III (December 25, 1907 – November 18, 1994) was an American jazz singer, songwriter, and bandleader whose exuberant style and mastery of scat singing made him one of the most celebrated entertainers of the swing era. Born in Rochester, New York, and raised in Baltimore, Maryland, Calloway initially pursued law studies in Chicago but was drawn to music, performing in local clubs and eventually leading his own band, the Alabamians. His early exposure to jazz and vaudeville, combined with mentorship from Louis Armstrong, helped shape his distinctive musical approach[1][2][3].

Calloway's career accelerated after he moved to New York in 1929, where he became a regular performer at Harlem's famed Cotton Club. Leading Cab Calloway and his Orchestra, he achieved national fame with the 1931 hit "Minnie the Moocher," notable for its infectious call-and-response "hi-de-hi-de-ho" chorus. Throughout the 1930s and 1940s, Calloway's band featured some of the era's top jazz musicians, including Dizzy Gillespie and Ben Webster, and toured extensively in the U.S. and abroad. His energetic performances, flamboyant stage presence, and innovative blending of jazz, blues, and vaudeville made him a star attraction[1][2][3].

Calloway's influence extended beyond music into film, radio, and literature. He appeared in movies such as "Stormy Weather" (1943) and "The Blues Brothers" (1980), and authored "The New Cab Calloway's Hepster's Dictionary" (1944), which documented jazz slang. He was the first African-American to host a nationally syndicated radio program and received numerous honors, including the National Medal of Arts and a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. His legacy endures through his recordings, signature style, and the generations of musicians he inspired[1][2][3].
