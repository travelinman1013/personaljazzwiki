## Biography
Larkin Poe is an acclaimed American roots rock and blues band formed by sisters Rebecca and Megan Lovell. Originally from Atlanta, Georgia, and now based in Nashville, Tennessee, the Lovell sisters began their musical journey in childhood, studying violin and piano before gravitating toward bluegrass and roots music in their teens. Their first major project was The Lovell Sisters, a bluegrass trio with their older sister Jessica, which gained national attention after winning the 'Talent from Twelve to Twenty' contest on A Prairie Home Companion in 2005 and earning awards such as the John Lennon Songwriting Contest grand prize in 2008. When Jessica left the group in 2009, Rebecca and Megan reinvented themselves as Larkin Poe in 2010, shifting their focus to blues, rock, and Americana, and naming the band after an ancestor who was a cousin of Edgar Allan Poe.

As Larkin Poe, the sisters quickly established a reputation for electrifying live performances, soulful vocals, and masterful slide guitar work. Their early releases, including the EP 'Spring' (2010), showcased their songwriting and instrumental prowess, leading to collaborations with major artists and producers such as T Bone Burnett and Elvis Costello. Their 2018 album 'Venom & Faith' earned a Grammy nomination for Best Contemporary Blues Album and topped the Billboard Blues Chart, while subsequent albums like 'Self Made Man' (2020) further expanded their artistic reach. Larkin Poe's music is characterized by a blend of blues, southern rock, and Americana, underpinned by tight sibling harmonies and a deep respect for American roots traditions.

Larkin Poe's legacy is marked by their ability to bridge traditional and modern sounds, drawing from the deep well of Southern musical heritage while infusing it with contemporary energy and innovation. Their influence extends through their prolific output, dynamic performances, and a strong independent spirit, making them torchbearers for a new generation of blues and roots musicians.
