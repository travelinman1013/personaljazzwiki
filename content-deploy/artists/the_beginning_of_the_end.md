## Biography
The Beginning of the End was a pioneering funk group originating from Nassau, Bahamas, formed in 1969. The band was composed of three brothers—Frank, Raphael "Ray," and Roy Munnings—alongside bassist Fred Henfield and guitarist Livingston Colebrook. Their sound was further enriched by the Funky Nassau Horns, which gave their music a distinctive, brassy edge. The group emerged at a time when Bahamian popular music was rarely heard internationally, making their success especially notable.

Their debut album, 'Funky Nassau,' released in 1971 on Alston Records (a subsidiary of Atlantic Records), quickly propelled them to fame. The title track, 'Funky Nassau,' became a major hit, reaching #15 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #7 on the Billboard R&B chart in the United States, and #31 on the UK Singles Chart in 1974. The song's infectious groove and Caribbean-influenced funk style made it a dancefloor classic and a staple of the genre. The group followed up with another album in 1976 before fading from the mainstream, but their work remains influential in funk and jazz-funk circles.

The Beginning of the End is remembered for blending American funk and soul with Bahamian rhythms, helping to introduce Caribbean musical elements to a wider audience. Their legacy is anchored by 'Funky Nassau,' which has been sampled and covered by numerous artists, and their role as one of the few soul groups from the Bahamas to achieve international recognition.
