## Biography
The Neville Brothers are a legendary American musical group from New Orleans, Louisiana, comprised of siblings Art, Charles, Aaron, and Cyril Neville. Raised in a musically rich environment, the brothers were exposed to New Orleans R&B, gospel, and Mardi Gras Indian traditions from an early age, learning chants from their uncle George 'Big Chief Jolly' Landry and drawing inspiration from local icons like Professor Longhair, Fats Domino, and Smiley Lewis. Each brother pursued successful solo careers before uniting as a band in 1977, following the influential Wild Tchoupitoulas project that celebrated their Indian heritage and New Orleans rhythms.

Their debut album, 'The Neville Brothers,' was released in 1978, quickly earning acclaim for its energetic blend of R&B, funk, soul, jazz, and New Orleans carnival music. The brothers became renowned for their electrifying live performances and were regulars at major festivals such as the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival. Over the next three decades, they released a string of influential albums, including 'Fiyo on the Bayou' and the Grammy-winning 'Yellow Moon,' and built a reputation as one of the most musically adventurous and enduring groups to emerge from New Orleans.

The Neville Brothers' legacy is marked by their seamless fusion of genres, deep family ties, and commitment to preserving and innovating the sounds of their hometown. Their music has influenced countless artists and remains a touchstone for New Orleans funk and soul, celebrated for its authenticity, spirit, and cultural significance.
