## Biography
Nick Sanders is an American jazz pianist and composer known for his intricate trio work and imaginative original compositions, particularly through a series of albums on Sunnyside Records. Originally from New Orleans, Louisiana, he grew up in a city steeped in jazz, an environment that helped shape his musical identity from an early age.[2][7] After showing strong aptitude for the piano, he went on to study formally at the New England Conservatory in Boston, where he completed undergraduate and graduate work in jazz performance and composition, working closely with several prominent pianist-teachers.[2] Following his studies, Sanders relocated to New York City, establishing himself in the Brooklyn jazz scene while developing his own trio concept.

Sanders’s recording career as a leader began with the trio album "Nameless Neighbors" (2012, Sunnyside), followed by "You Are a Creature" (2015/2016), "Playtime 2050" (2019), and "Phantoms of Memory" (2021), all on Sunnyside Records.[2][3] His long‑standing trio with bassist Henry Fraser and drummer Connor Baker serves as the primary vehicle for his compositions, which blend modern jazz harmony, rhythmic complexity, and a sense of narrative structure. Produced and mentored by pianist Fred Hersch, these records showcase Sanders’s refined touch at the keyboard, his interest in collective interaction within the trio, and his commitment to original music.[2][3] Active as a performer, recording artist, and educator, he represents a contemporary New York–based approach to jazz piano that is deeply informed by tradition yet oriented toward forward‑looking composition.

## Fun Facts
- Sanders was born and raised in New Orleans, a city he has described as “jazz‑rich,” and he has reflected on how growing up there made jazz feel like a natural part of life rather than an abstract style.[2][7]
- His debut trio album "Nameless Neighbors" helped secure his deal with Sunnyside Records after Fred Hersch invited him to play his music for the label, which then chose to sign him.[2]
- Though he writes all of the trio’s material, Sanders emphasizes the collective nature of his band, crediting bassist Henry Fraser and drummer Connor Baker with extensive input on arrangements and development of the pieces.[2]
- Sanders seriously considered transferring to the Manhattan School of Music, but remained at New England Conservatory on a full scholarship in part because Fred Hersch stayed on faculty and Jason Moran had just joined, giving him access to multiple major pianist‑mentors at once.[2]
