## Biography
Cash O'Riley is an American singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist known for his energetic blend of rockabilly, psychobilly, roots rock, and Americana. Born in Jackson, Michigan, O'Riley spent his formative years living a nomadic lifestyle, moving between Eastern Kentucky and Lake County, Florida. This itinerant upbringing deeply influenced his songwriting, which often explores themes of hard living, tough love, and the struggle between good and evil.

O'Riley's career has been marked by his reputation as a 'one man dirty hippie band,' performing solo with a raw, stripped-down sound that draws comparisons to Johnny Cash and Tom Petty. His music fuses elements of rock & roll, blues, folk, punk, and country, creating a unique style that resonates with fans of classic American roots music. Over the years, he has become a fixture in the Midwest music scene, particularly around Lansing, Michigan, performing both solo and with his band, The Cash O'Riley Show.

With a career spanning several decades, O'Riley has built a loyal following through relentless touring and a dynamic live presence. His legacy lies in his ability to channel the spirit of Americana through gritty storytelling and a genre-blending musical approach.
