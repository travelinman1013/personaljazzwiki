## Biography
Leon Bridges, born Todd Michael Bridges on July 13, 1989, in Atlanta, Georgia, grew up in Fort Worth, Texas after his family relocated when he was two years old[6][1]. Raised in a modest household, Bridges was exposed to a blend of gospel, soul, and '90s R&B through his parents, who had diverse musical tastes—his mother favored gospel and artists like Anita Baker, while his father introduced him to legends such as Curtis Mayfield and Stevie Wonder[1]. Despite feeling isolated during his school years, Bridges found solace in music and dance, eventually teaching himself guitar and performing at local open-mic nights while working restaurant jobs to support his family[2][1].

Bridges' breakthrough came when he met guitarist Austin Jenkins and drummer Joshua Block, who helped him record his first songs using vintage equipment to evoke the classic soul sound of the 1950s and 1960s[6]. His debut album, 'Coming Home' (2015), was acclaimed for its authentic retro soul style and earned a Grammy nomination, with the title track gaining widespread attention, including use in an Apple commercial[6]. Subsequent albums 'Good Thing' (2018) and 'Gold-Diggers Sound' (2021) further showcased his evolving artistry, blending soul, R&B, and gospel influences, and received additional Grammy nominations, solidifying his reputation as a torchbearer of modern soul[6].

Bridges' legacy lies in his ability to channel vintage soul through a contemporary lens, drawing comparisons to Sam Cooke and Otis Redding while collaborating with a range of artists across genres. His heartfelt songwriting, smooth vocals, and dedication to authentic musical expression have inspired a new generation of musicians and listeners, making him one of the most respected voices in retro soul today[6][1].
