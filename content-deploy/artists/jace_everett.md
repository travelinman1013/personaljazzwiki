## Biography
Jace Everett Beasley, born May 27, 1972, in Evansville, Indiana, is an American singer-songwriter recognized for his distinctive blend of southern gothic, country, and rock influences. His early life was marked by frequent moves due to his father's work, taking him from Indiana through Missouri and ultimately to Texas, where he began performing music in church and school settings. Everett later relocated to Nashville, Tennessee, to attend Belmont University, immersing himself in the heart of the American music industry.

Everett's professional breakthrough came in 2005 when he signed with Epic Records and released his debut single, 'That's the Kind of Love I'm In,' which reached No. 52 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart. He gained further acclaim as the co-writer of Josh Turner's chart-topping hit 'Your Man.' However, Everett is perhaps best known for his song 'Bad Things,' which became the theme for the HBO series True Blood, earning international recognition and charting in several countries. Over his career, Everett has released multiple albums, including 'Red Revelations' and 'Terra Rosa,' the latter noted for its biblical themes and genre-blending style. His music is characterized by dark, poetic lyrics and a sound that draws on southern gospel, rock, and Americana traditions, establishing him as a unique voice within the southern gothic genre.
