## Biography
Oscar Jerome is a British guitarist, vocalist, and songwriter born in Norwich, England, who has become a prominent figure in London’s vibrant jazz and soul scene. Growing up in a musically supportive family, he began guitar lessons at age eight and was performing in bands by age eleven, initially inspired by rock and grunge acts like Nirvana and Rage Against the Machine. His formal music education took place at the esteemed Trinity Laban Conservatoire in London, where he honed his jazz technique and deepened his appreciation for artists such as George Benson, Wes Montgomery, and John Coltrane.

After moving to London, Jerome quickly established himself among the city’s leading jazz musicians, blending jazz, soul, hip-hop, and funk into a distinctive sound marked by virtuosic guitar work and introspective lyricism. He gained international recognition as a founding member and composer for the afrobeat collective Kokoroko, notably penning their breakout single 'Abusey Junction.' Jerome’s solo career flourished with acclaimed releases like his debut album 'Breathe Deep' and the introspective follow-up 'The Spoon,' the latter written during a period of personal reflection in Berlin. His live performances have taken him across Europe, the US, and Australia, including supporting Kamasi Washington on tour.

Oscar Jerome’s music is celebrated for its emotional sincerity and genre-blurring innovation, drawing from a wide palette of influences and collaborations. He remains a central figure in the UK’s new wave of jazz, regularly working with peers such as Moses Boyd, Shabaka Hutchings, and Lianne La Havas, and is recognized for both his technical mastery and his willingness to address personal and political themes in his songwriting.
