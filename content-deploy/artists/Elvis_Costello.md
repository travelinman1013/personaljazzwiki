## Biography
Declan Patrick MacManus, professionally known as Elvis Costello, was born on 25 August 1954 in London, England. He began writing songs and teaching himself guitar by age 14, performing in folk clubs in London and later Liverpool after moving there at 16. While working as a computer operator at Midland Bank in Bootle and later in Putney, he pursued music, joining the folk-rock duo Rusty with Allan Mayes in 1972 and writing hundreds of songs by 1977.[1][2]

Costello's career breakthrough came with his debut album *My Aim Is True* (1977), recorded with American country-rock band Clover for Stiff Records, featuring hits like 'Alison.' He then formed the Attractions—Pete Thomas (drums), Bruce Thomas (bass), and Steve Nieve (keyboards)—releasing *This Year's Model* (1978) and *Armed Forces* (1979), which defined new wave with punk energy, sophisticated lyrics, and power pop elements. His style evolved across genres, including collaborations like *Wise Up Ghost* with the Roots (2013) and Grammy-winning *Look Now* (2018).[1][2][4][5]

Tensions led to the Attractions' breakup in 1986 after *Goodbye Cruel World* (1984), though they reunited briefly in the 1990s. Costello later formed the Imposters with Davey Faragher on bass, releasing albums like *The Delivery Man* (2004). His legacy endures as a prolific songwriter, record producer, author, and occasional television presenter, blending cynicism, wit, and musical versatility.[2][3]

## Fun Facts
- His stage name 'Elvis Costello' was chosen by managers Jake Riviera and Dave Robinson in 1977 specifically to attract attention by referencing Elvis Presley, who was still alive at the time.[1]
- On *Saturday Night Live* in December 1977, he defied producers by abruptly switching from 'Less Than Zero' to the unrecorded 'Radio Radio,' sparking controversy.[2]
- He recorded *My Aim Is True* in just six four-hour sessions over several weeks for about £1,000 while holding a full-time office job.[1][2]
- Tensions with bassist Bruce Thomas were so severe that Costello banned him from Attractions reunion shows, contributing to the band's final split in 1996.[2]
