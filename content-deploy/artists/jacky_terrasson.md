# Jacky Terrasson

## Biography
Jacky Terrasson was born in Berlin in 1965 to an American mother and a French father, and was raised in Paris where he began studying classical piano at age five.[2] At age 12, he discovered his mother's extensive jazz record collection, which inspired him to transition from classical to jazz piano at age 13.[1][2] During his studies at the Lycée Lamartine performing arts school in Paris, he met Francis Paudras, a noted jazz patron and close associate of Bud Powell, who became instrumental in introducing him to American jazz greats and the local jazz scene.[2] At age 18, Paudras encouraged Terrasson to move to the United States and attend Berklee College of Music in Boston, where he studied with renowned pianists Ray Santisi and Danilo Pérez, and performed regularly at local clubs.[2]

Terrasson's breakthrough came in 1993 when he won the prestigious Thelonious Monk International Jazz Piano Competition, a victory that sparked a major label bidding war and led to his signing with Blue Note Records.[1][2] The day after winning the competition, he was hired by legendary vocalist Betty Carter as her pianist and toured with her for nearly a year.[1][2] His 1994 self-titled Blue Note debut and subsequent albums established him as one of the most distinctive voices in modern jazz, with his feathery keyboard touch combined with power, passion, and complete understanding of blues and improvisation.[4] In 1994, The New York Times Magazine recognized him as one of 30 artists under 30 most likely to impact American culture in the following three decades.[1][5]

Throughout his career, Terrasson has recorded extensively for Blue Note and other labels, releasing acclaimed albums including Reach, Alive, Kindred (with vibist Stefon Harris), À Paris (a collection of French favorites), Smile, and Into The Blue (with Emmanuel Pahud).[1] He has become the most widely heard French jazz musician on digital platforms and continues to perform and record with his distinctive trio sound, blending elegance and exuberance with improvisational mastery.[5] His work has earned him two Grammy nominations and international recognition for his innovative arrangements and compositions that honor both his French-American heritage and the jazz tradition.

## Fun Facts
- Terrasson discovered jazz through his mother's record collection at age 12, which inspired him to abandon classical piano for the 'freedom of expression in improvisation.'[1]
- After winning the Thelonious Monk Competition in 1993, Betty Carter hired him as her pianist the very next day, launching his professional career with one of jazz's greatest vocalists.[1][2]
- The New York Times Magazine recognized Terrasson exactly one year after his Monk Competition victory as one of 30 artists under 30 most likely to shape American culture in the following three decades.[1][5]
- Terrasson's album Smile was ranked in the Top Ten Best Albums by the International Herald Tribune and won the 2003 Victoires du Jazz award and a Gold Django.[3]
