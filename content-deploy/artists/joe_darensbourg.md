## Biography
Joe Darensbourg was born in Baton Rouge, Louisiana on July 9, 1906, to a French-speaking Creole family with ancestral roots in France.[1] He became a full-time musician around 1920, joining the renowned Baton Rouge-based band of banjoist Toots Johnson, which featured New Orleans legends Guy Kelly and Captain John Handy.[1] His early career was marked by restless wanderlust and musical exploration—he traveled to Los Angeles in 1922, worked with Mexican bands, joined the Martel Family Orchestra near Opelousas, and even ran away with a circus, fulfilling a lifelong dream to perform in a circus band.[1] During the late 1920s, Darensbourg worked in St. Louis with Charlie Creath's Jazz-o-Maniacs, Jelly Roll Morton, and Fate Marable on riverboat jobs, before eventually settling in Los Angeles where he would spend most of his career.[1]

Darensbourg's Los Angeles period established him as a reliable and versatile musician who worked with several significant ensembles. He performed with Mutt Carey's Jeffersonians at taxi dance halls and on silent film sets, and later joined trumpeter Teddy Buckner's group, which worked steadily at the 400 Club for three years and recorded for Gene Norman's Dixieland Jubilee label.[1] His most notable commercial success came with his own group, Joe Darensbourg & His Dixie Flyers, which achieved an unexpected hit with "Yellow Dog Blues," featuring his distinctive slap-tonguing technique that sold over a million copies and caught the attention of disc jockeys nationwide.[1] The Dixie Flyers remained active until 1960, and Darensbourg subsequently performed with the Mark Twain riverboat band at Disneyland and the Louis Armstrong All Stars, touring extensively across the United States and Europe.[1][2]

Darensbourg's legacy rests on his reputation as one of the most reliable and versatile traditional jazz clarinetists and soprano saxophonist of his era. Though he never achieved household-name status, likely due to his West Coast base, he was a key member of several important ensembles including Kid Ory's band, Teddy Buckner's group, and Louis Armstrong's All Stars.[1] He recorded extensively throughout his career, with the Tom Lord Discography listing 85 record dates between 1944 and 1983.[2] Darensbourg suffered a crippling stroke on February 5, 1985, and died of cardiac arrest on May 25, 1985.[1] He left behind a remarkable legacy of musical versatility, professionalism, and the ability to work successfully across multiple jazz styles and ensembles.

## Fun Facts
- Darensbourg's signature technique of slap-tonguing on 'Yellow Dog Blues' with his Dixie Flyers became an unexpected million-selling hit that caught the attention of disc jockeys across the country—a sound that was completely novel at the time.[1]
- One of his lifelong ambitions was to perform in a circus band, which he achieved when he ran away with a circus and traveled as far as California as a roustabout, eventually parading down the main street of his hometown playing saxophone with the Al G Barnes Circus sideshow band.[1]
- During his time in St. Louis in the late 1920s, Darensbourg was caught in the crossfire of a gang war between rival bootleggers and was shot and beaten as part of retaliatory violence.[1]
