## Biography
The Heliocentrics are a London-based musical collective formed in the early 2000s, built around drummer and producer Malcolm Catto, bassist Jake Ferguson, guitarist Adrian Owusu, and multi-instrumentalist Jack Yglesias. Emerging from the ashes of the funk revivalist band The Soul Destroyers, Catto and Ferguson sought to break free from genre constraints, channeling their diverse influences into a new, experimental sound. Their debut album, 'Out There' (2007), set the tone for their genre-defying approach, blending funk, jazz, psychedelia, and library music, and quickly established them as innovators in the UK underground scene.[1][2][3][4]

Throughout their career, The Heliocentrics have become known for their adventurous collaborations, most notably with Ethiopian jazz legend Mulatu Astatke on the acclaimed album 'Inspiration Information' (2009), which won the Gilles Peterson Worldwide Album of the Year award. Their discography includes work with other global artists such as Lloyd Miller, Orlando Julius, and Melvin Van Peebles, as well as contributions to projects by DJ Shadow and The Gaslamp Killer. The group's music is characterized by improvisational structures, vintage analogue production, and a willingness to incorporate elements from hip-hop, Afrobeat, krautrock, and avant-garde traditions, resulting in a sound that is both primitive and contemporary.[1][2][3][6][8]

The Heliocentrics' legacy lies in their restless creativity and refusal to be pigeonholed, inspiring a new wave of musicians to explore the intersections of jazz, funk, and global sounds. Their influence is felt across the modern jazz and beat scenes, and their records are regarded as essential listening for those interested in the evolution of psychedelic and experimental music in the 21st century.[1][2][7][9]
