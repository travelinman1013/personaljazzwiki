## Biography
The Crosscurrents Trio, comprising Dave Holland, Zakir Hussain, and Chris Potter, represents a convergence of jazz and Indian classical traditions at the highest level. Formed in 2019 at the initiative of Zakir Hussain, the trio brings together three world-renowned musicians: Holland, a British-born double bassist celebrated for his work with Miles Davis and as a prolific bandleader; Hussain, an Indian tabla virtuoso and global ambassador of rhythm; and Potter, an American saxophonist lauded as one of the most influential of his generation[2][4].

Dave Holland began his career in the UK, quickly gaining recognition as a 'house bassist' at Ronnie Scott’s Jazz Club in the late 1960s before being recruited by Miles Davis. His tenure with Davis included landmark albums such as 'Filles de Kilimanjaro,' 'In a Silent Way,' and 'Bitches Brew,' which helped define the jazz fusion era. Holland later led his own ensembles, recording over two dozen albums and collaborating with a who’s who of jazz innovators[2][3]. Zakir Hussain, son of legendary tabla player Alla Rakha, was steeped in Indian classical music from an early age and became a central figure in world music through collaborations with John McLaughlin (Shakti), Mickey Hart (Planet Drum), and numerous other luminaries. Chris Potter, known for his technical mastery and inventive improvisation, has played with artists such as Herbie Hancock, Pat Metheny, and Dave Holland himself, earning a reputation as a standard-bearer for modern jazz saxophone[2][3].

Musically, the trio’s style is marked by intricate rhythmic interplay, sophisticated improvisation, and a seamless blend of jazz and Indian classical elements. Their debut album 'Good Hope' (2019) showcases the trio’s virtuosic musicianship and mutual respect, offering a fresh and inspired take on global jazz fusion[4]. The Crosscurrents Trio stands as a testament to the possibilities of cross-cultural collaboration, pushing the boundaries of contemporary jazz while honoring deep musical traditions.
