## Biography
Skull Snaps is a **New York–based funk trio** best known for their 1973 self‑titled album on GSF Records and the drum break from “It’s a New Day,” later canonized as one of hip‑hop’s most sampled grooves.[1][2][4][5] The group grew out of 1960s soul act **The Diplomats**, an East Coast vocal group that worked the New York–New Jersey–D.C. club circuit and cut sides for labels such as Arock, enjoying modest regional success before gradually transforming into a self‑contained singing and playing band.[1][2][4] As the Diplomats era waned, bassist/tenor vocalist **Samm Culley**, guitarist/falsetto vocalist **Ervan (Erv) Waters**, and drummer/bass vocalist **George Bragg** solidified as a powerful three‑piece unit, briefly working under names like the **Soul Three** before adopting the name Skull Snaps, a phrase inspired by audiences who said their huge sound “snapped” their skulls.[1][4]

Cut largely at Tony Camillo’s Venture Studio in New Jersey with engineer/producer **Ed Stasium**, the 1973 *Skull Snaps* LP fused hard, syncopated funk rhythms with soulful vocal harmonies and socially tinged songwriting, yielding deep cuts such as “My Hang Up Is You,” “Having You Around,” and “It’s a New Day.”[2][4][5] Despite its musical strength, the album appeared on a small label, featured only skeletal cover art (a strategic move, Culley has said, to avoid racial bias in 1970s marketing), and received little promotion; GSF soon folded, and the group effectively disappeared from view even as the record slowly became a coveted rare groove in Europe.[1][4][5] From the mid‑1980s onward, hip‑hop producers began looping the drum break from “It’s a New Day,” turning this once‑obscure LP into a foundational source for breakbeat culture, and by the 2000s Skull Snaps were widely regarded as one of the most sampled groups in hip‑hop history, prompting a partial reunion and new releases that finally brought the musicians’ names and story to wider light.[1][2][3][4][5][7]

Beyond the Skull Snaps name, the trio’s careers extended through the 1970s under other guises. They recorded as **All Dyrections**, cutting a version of “Soul Makossa” for Buddah Records, and often worked anonymously behind the scenes as writers, arrangers, and backing musicians on New York soul and funk sessions.[4] Culley, in particular, collaborated with Fatback Band leader **Bill Curtis**, producing, arranging, and even singing for Fatback‑associated acts like the Puzzles, while the Skull Snaps rhythm section backed **Screamin’ Jay Hawkins** on the 1977 single “Africa Gone Funky.”[1][4] Although drummer George Bragg passed away in 2007, Culley and Waters have periodically resurfaced for interviews and projects, and a 2005 single on Ten12 Records (“Snapped” / “I’m Your Pimp”) reunited the original Skull Snaps lineup, affirming the trio’s enduring bond and underlining how a short‑lived 1970s project evolved into a long‑term legacy through sampling and reissue culture.[1][2][4][7]

## Fun Facts
- The original 1973 *Skull Snaps* LP deliberately omitted photos of the band and instead used an illustration of three skulls; Samm Culley has explained that the group and label believed hiding that they were a Black band might help them get more radio play in a racially biased market.[1][4]
- For decades, record collectors and hip‑hop producers speculated about who was actually behind the mysterious Skull Snaps album because reissues sometimes removed the musician credits, leading to myths that the band was an anonymous studio project; only in the 2000s did interviews firmly re‑establish Culley, Waters, and Bragg as the core trio.[1][3][4]
- Engineer Ed Stasium—later famous for work with the Ramones, Talking Heads, and Living Colour—has said that *Skull Snaps* was the **first album he ever recorded**, meaning one of hip‑hop’s most important drum breaks comes from his debut LP‑length session.[4][5]
- Although the group was thought to have vanished after 1973, they continued working under other names, backed Screamin’ Jay Hawkins on the 1977 single “Africa Gone Funky,” and eventually reunited as Skull Snaps for a 2005 single, making their story far more continuous than the one‑and‑done myth suggests.[1][2][4]

## Musical Connections

### Mentors/Influences
- [[al_gee|Al Gee]] - Radio personality and industry figure who encouraged the trio to move from being primarily a vocal group into more serious songwriting and recording under their own steam; they later honored him in song.

- [[lloyd_price|Lloyd Price]] - Veteran R&B star and label owner who visited their sessions, was struck by the power of the trio’s sound, and whose reaction helped solidify the Skull Snaps name and confidence in their hard‑funk direction. (Involvement as label owner/executive producer during early Skull Snaps sessions; his exclamation that the group “snapped” his skull became part of the name story.) [Around 1972–1973, during the recording of the *Skull Snaps* album for GSF Records.]

### Key Collaborators
- [[ed_stasium|Ed Stasium]] - Engineer/producer who recorded and mixed the 1973 *Skull Snaps* album at Venture Studio; has described it as the first album he ever worked on, shaping the record’s tight, punchy sound. (Engineering/production on *Skull Snaps* (1973).) [Early 1973.]
- [[george_kerr|George Kerr]] - Songwriter/producer brought in to help the group manage the load of writing and arranging material as they transitioned from the Diplomats into Skull Snaps.

- [[bill_curtis_fatback_band|Bill Curtis (Fatback Band)]] - Bandleader and producer with whom Samm Culley worked extensively after the Skull Snaps album, strengthening ties to the New York funk and disco underground. (Production, arrangements, and vocals by Culley on Fatback‑related projects such as the Puzzles’ releases on Fatback Records; broader studio collaboration within Curtis’s orbit.) [Mid‑1970s.]
- [[screamin_jay_hawkins|Screamin’ Jay Hawkins]] - Legendary R&B shouter whom Skull Snaps (incognito) backed on a late‑’70s single blending funk with Hawkins’s theatrical style. (“Africa Gone Funky” (London Records 45), produced by Samm Culley, with Skull Snaps functioning as the backing band.) [1977.]
- [[all_dyrections_alias_project|All Dyrections (alias project)]] - Name under which the Skull Snaps core trio recorded post‑album material, showing their continued activity as a band despite the Skull Snaps moniker going quiet publicly. (Single “Soul Makossa” for Buddah Records, recorded under the All Dyrections name.) [Mid‑1970s.]

### Artists Influenced
- [[stezo|Stezo]] - One of the first hip‑hop artists to foreground the “It’s a New Day” drum break, helping to canonize it within late‑1980s East Coast rap production. (“It’s My Turn” (1989), which flips the Skull Snaps drum pattern.) [Late 1980s.]
- [[eric_b._and_rakim|Eric B. & Rakim]] - Iconic duo whose use of the break helped cement the Skull Snaps groove as a standard toolkit element for golden‑age producers. (“Run for Cover” (1992), built around the “It’s a New Day” drums.) [Early 1990s.]
- [[gang_starr_dj_premier_and_guru|Gang Starr (DJ Premier & Guru)]] - Key exponents of jazzy yet hard‑edged boom‑bap who tapped Skull Snaps for rhythmic foundations, extending the break’s life into the 1990s underground.

- [[the_pharcyde|The Pharcyde]] - West Coast alternative hip‑hop group who drew on classic breaks; sample documentation lists the Skull Snaps drum pattern among the textures they and their producers used. (Early‑1990s material (e.g., *Bizarre Ride II the Pharcyde*) that participates in the era’s broader reuse of the “It’s a New Day” break.) [Early 1990s.]
- [[prodigy_mobb_deep_and_the_wider_boombap_school|Prodigy (Mobb Deep) and the wider boom‑bap school]] - Skull Snaps’ break became part of the standard palette for gritty East Coast hip‑hop, influencing countless producers and MCs who rapped over its distinctive snap and swing. (Various Mobb Deep and Queensbridge‑affiliated productions that employ the Skull Snaps drum sound, as documented in sample‑usage databases.) [Mid‑1990s onward.]
