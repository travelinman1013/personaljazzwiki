## Biography
Chloé Marie is a singer-songwriter and performer whose career bridges the worlds of indie pop, neo-soul, and musical theater. Born and raised in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, she developed a passion for music early on, participating in orchestras, choirs, and musical theater productions throughout her youth. Her musical journey took a significant turn in 2016 when she formed the five-piece band Alabaster Stag, known for their lively performances in Baton Rouge and New Orleans, and for opening for acts such as Tank and the Bangas, Boyfriend, Flow Tribe, Anna Wise, and Seratones. In addition to her band work, Chloé Marie has pursued a solo career, crafting music that reflects her lived experiences and emotional landscape, often blending pop sensibilities with soulful undertones and a contemporary edge.

After relocating to New Orleans in 2020, Chloé Marie expanded her creative pursuits beyond music. She became a puppeteer and the voice of Cynthia on the Louisiana Public Broadcasting/PBS series 'Ziggy’s Art Adventure,' a Jim Henson-inspired show that celebrates the arts and features local musical influences. Her ability to connect with audiences is evident both on stage—whether as a frontwoman for Alabaster Stag or as a solo artist—and in the theater, where she has performed in productions such as 'Hair,' 'Little Shop of Horrors,' and 'Newsies.' Chloé Marie’s style is characterized by its emotional honesty, dynamic stage presence, and a willingness to explore the full spectrum of the human experience through music and performance.
