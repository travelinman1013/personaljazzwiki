## Biography
George 'Daddy Hotcakes' Montgomery was born on May 15, 1894, in Rehovat, Georgia. He began singing the blues as a youngster and moved to St. Louis in 1918, where he immersed himself in the local music scene. By the 1940s, he had settled permanently in St. Louis, performing on the streets and entertaining passengers on streetcars, embodying the raw, grassroots tradition of pre-war blues[2][3][4].

Active as a blues musician from the 1920s through the 1960s, Montgomery's career centered on St. Louis blues, a style blending country blues and classic blues elements, as reflected in his appearances on albums like *The Blues in St. Louis, Vol. 1*. His music captured the itinerant spirit of early 20th-century blues performers, relying on street performances rather than widespread commercial success. Despite limited recordings, he remained a fixture in St. Louis's blues community into his later years[4][5][6].

Montgomery's legacy lies in preserving authentic, unpolished St. Louis blues traditions. With zero popularity on modern platforms like Spotify, his influence endures through archival releases that highlight forgotten chapters of American blues history[5].
