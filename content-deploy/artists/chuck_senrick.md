## Biography
Chuck Senrick is an American singer, songwriter, and pianist from Farmington, Minnesota, whose gentle, introspective 1970s lounge‑soul album *Dreamin’* became a cult favorite decades after its original release. Harsh Minnesota winters and a lack of competition from siblings gave him years of unfettered access to the family piano, where he learned both by ear and through formal instruction, developing the quietly sophisticated harmonic sense that would define his later work.[1][2] By age 15 he was already gigging professionally, first playing Allman Brothers, Blind Faith, and Cream covers with John Zimmer and the CR4 at the Sea Girt Inn in Lake Orchard, and he soon decided to pursue music as a full‑time career.[1][2]

At 20, Senrick moved about 30 miles north to the Twin Cities to commit fully to music, using borrowed equipment and friends’ living rooms as makeshift studios.[1] In 1976–77 he recorded his only full‑length album, *Dreamin’*, in a series of informal sessions built almost entirely around his Fender Rhodes electric piano, a Donca Matic/Doncamatic Mini Pops drum machine, and his unadorned, youthful vocals.[1][2] Just 200 privately pressed copies were made and sold or given away at gigs, with a hand‑drawn cover by his wife Lesli featuring a portrait of Senrick set against the Minneapolis skyline.[1][2] Musically, *Dreamin’* blends elements of marina soul, easy listening, loner folk, jazz, and lounge, with minimal arrangements, bittersweet melodies, and conversational lyrics that quietly document the everyday world around him—from shared apartments (“Drop A Dime”) to his marriage (“Wedding Trilogy”).[1][2]

Although the album vanished into obscurity for decades—its master reels even lost during a producer’s divorce—it gradually gained recognition among collectors, eventually resurfacing via a chance discovery of an original copy in a Japanese second‑hand shop by DJ and producer Stefan Leisering, who helped bring it to a wider international audience.[1][2] Through all of this, Senrick maintained a working musician’s life rather than pursuing mainstream fame: he played as an all‑round entertainer in bars and restaurants, toured with bands such as the Shuffle Brothers across Minnesota in the late 1970s, accompanied the Claudio Baltierras Ensemble, and from 1982 spent over four decades as the resident pianist at Jim’s Steak House in Bloomington, Illinois, where he led his long‑running “At Home At The Piano Bar” evenings.[2][5] His understated catalog—augmented only by self‑released cassette recordings like *Island Live* and *Cheap Thrills* in the 1990s—has since been reassessed as a timeless, brutally honest snapshot of a working bar pianist with a songwriter’s lyrical sensitivity.[2][4]

## Fun Facts
- Only about 200 copies of Chuck Senrick’s 1976–77 private‑press LP *Dreamin’* were originally made, sold hand‑to‑hand at gigs or given to friends, contributing to its later status as a rare cult collector’s item.[1][2]
- The album *Dreamin’* was recorded almost entirely in friends’ living rooms using just a Fender Rhodes electric piano and a Donca Matic/Doncamatic Mini Pops drum machine, giving it a uniquely intimate lounge‑meets‑bedroom sound.[1][2][4]
- Senrick’s wife Lesli illustrated the original *Dreamin’* cover art, drawing a pen‑and‑ink portrait of him against the Minneapolis skyline with herself and their newborn son on a nearby knoll.[1][2]
- After moving to Florida’s Anna Maria Island for six years, Senrick played almost exclusively at a single venue, Café Robar, and spent much of his free time building elaborate sand castles—his second great love after music.[2]
