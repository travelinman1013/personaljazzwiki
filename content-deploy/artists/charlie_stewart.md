## Biography
Charlie Stewart is a Scottish fiddle player and double bassist known for his work in traditional and contemporary folk and jazz-informed projects. Born and raised in Scotland, he grew up immersed in traditional music and developed his instrumental skills at a young age through the country’s vibrant session and teaching culture.[4] Over time he became active on the Scottish scene both as a sideman and ensemble member, balancing deep roots in Scottish traditional music with an openness to improvisation and cross-genre collaboration.[4]

Stewart’s career has included performances with leading Scottish and UK-based traditional and folk artists, notably working in a traditional idiom with harpist Rebecca Hill and other ensembles that explore the intersection of folk, jazz, and contemporary acoustic music.[4] His playing is marked by rhythmic drive on double bass, lyrical and ornamented fiddle lines, and a stylistic palette that draws primarily on Scottish traditional music while engaging with broader acoustic and improvisatory influences.[4] Through live performances at events such as the Lagavulin Islay Jazz Festival and other Scottish festivals and venues, he has built a reputation as a versatile accompanist and ensemble player rather than a spotlight-seeking solo artist, contributing to the evolving sound of modern Scottish traditional music.[4]
