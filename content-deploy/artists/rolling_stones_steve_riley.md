## Biography
Steve Riley is a renowned American accordionist and bandleader celebrated for his contributions to Cajun and zydeco music. Born and raised in Mamou, Louisiana, Riley was immersed in the region’s rich musical traditions from a young age, learning Cajun French and the accordion from local masters. He formed Steve Riley & the Mamou Playboys in 1988, quickly establishing the group as one of the leading lights of contemporary Cajun music. Their early albums focused on traditional Cajun songs, but Riley and his band soon began composing original material that honored the genre’s roots while pushing its boundaries.

Over the decades, Riley has become a pivotal figure in the preservation and evolution of Louisiana’s musical heritage. His style blends the driving rhythms of zydeco with the melodic intricacies of Cajun music, often sung in French and characterized by energetic accordion and fiddle interplay. Riley’s work has earned him widespread acclaim, multiple Grammy nominations, and a reputation as a bridge between generations of Louisiana musicians. He continues to perform, record, and collaborate, notably appearing with The Rolling Stones on the Clifton Chenier tribute album, where his accordion playing helped fuse rock and zydeco traditions[2][3][5].

Riley’s legacy is marked by his commitment to cultural authenticity and innovation. He has mentored younger musicians, championed traditional music education, and played a key role in bringing Cajun and zydeco sounds to international audiences. Through his recordings, live performances, and collaborations, Riley remains a vital ambassador for the music of South Louisiana.
