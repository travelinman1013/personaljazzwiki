## Biography
Omar Sosa is a six-time Grammy-nominated Cuban jazz pianist, composer, and bandleader born on April 10, 1965, in Camagüey, Cuba's largest inland city. At age eight, he began studying percussion and marimba at the music conservatory in Camagüey, later moving to Havana as a teenager to study piano at the prestigious Escuela Nacional de Música, where he completed his formal education at the Instituto Superior de Arte. In the 1980s, Sosa founded the band Tributo, recording albums and touring while also working with Cuban vocalist Xiomara Laugart and several Latin jazz bands, including touring in Angola, the Congo, Ethiopia, and Nicaragua during this period.

Sosa's artistic journey took him across continents beginning in 1993 when he moved to Quito, Ecuador, where he immersed himself in the folkloric traditions of Esmeraldas, particularly its distinctive marimba tradition rooted in African heritage. In 1995, he relocated to the San Francisco Bay Area, where he quickly invigorated the Latin jazz scene with his adventurous writing and percussive style. He later moved to Palma de Mallorca, Spain, before finally settling in Barcelona. His music fuses a wide range of jazz, world music, and electronic elements with his native Afro-Cuban roots to create a fresh and original urban sound, blending the folkloric with the contemporary and the ancestral with the urban.

Throughout his career, Sosa has performed upwards of 100 concerts annually across six continents at prestigious venues including Carnegie Hall's Zankel Hall, the Blue Note clubs in New York, Milan, and Tokyo, London's Barbican, and major festivals such as Monterey Jazz, Montreal Jazz, North Sea Jazz, and Montreux Jazz. His recording career began in 1997 with his first solo piano album "Omar Omar" and has continued with over 22 albums as a leader, earning him multiple Grammy and Latin Grammy nominations, including for "Sentir" (2002), "Mulatos" (2005), and "Across The Divide" (2009). He has received visiting artist fellowships at Princeton University and Dartmouth College, and has collaborated with numerous international artists including Paolo Fresu, Seckou Keita, and Adam Rudolph. Sosa has released most of his recordings on his own Otá label and won the 10th Independent Music Awards in January 2011 with the NDR Bigband for the album "Ceremony."
