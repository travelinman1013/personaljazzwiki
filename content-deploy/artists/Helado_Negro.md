## Biography
Roberto Carlos Lange, known professionally as Helado Negro, is an American musician, producer, and multidisciplinary artist born in 1980 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida to Ecuadorian immigrant parents[3][4]. Growing up in South Florida, Lange was deeply influenced by his Latin American heritage, often singing ballads at family gatherings and spending holidays in Ecuador[1]. He later earned a degree in Computer Art and Animation from Savannah College of Art and Design, which informed his creative approach across music, video, sculpture, and performance[2][3].

Helado Negro emerged in 2009 with his debut album 'Awe Owe,' quickly establishing a reputation for crafting immersive, bilingual soundscapes that blend Latin alternative, indie, avant-pop, and electronic elements[7][5]. His music is marked by dreamy, psychedelic textures and lyrics that explore identity, relationships, and cultural pride, with notable works including 'Private Energy' (2016), 'This Is How You Smile' (2019), and 'Far In' (2021)[1][5]. Lange's work often reflects personal and political themes, particularly around Latinx identity and self-love, resonating strongly with listeners from marginalized communities[1][5].

Throughout his career, Lange has been a prolific collaborator, working with artists such as Sufjan Stevens, Julianna Barwick (as Ombre), Mikael Jorgensen (Wilco), and Guillermo Scott Herren (Prefuse 73)[2][3]. He has presented multidisciplinary exhibitions, such as 'Kite Symphony' with his wife Kristi Sword, and performed at major cultural institutions and festivals worldwide[2][3]. Now based in Asheville, North Carolina, Helado Negro continues to expand his artistic universe, influencing a new generation of musicians with his innovative, deeply personal approach to music and art[1][3].
