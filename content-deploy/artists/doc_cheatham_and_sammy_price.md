## Biography
Doc Cheatham & Sammy Price is not a fixed, permanent band but rather a documented collaboration between two veteran American jazz musicians: trumpeter and singer **Adolphus “Doc” Cheatham** (1905–1997) and pianist, bandleader, and composer **Samuel Blythe “Sammy” Price** (1908–1992).[1][6][9] Both men came of age during the classic jazz and swing eras and, after long independent careers, recorded and toured together later in life, notably in Europe in the late 1950s and again from the late 1960s onward, when Price often led small groups featuring Cheatham on trumpet.[1][7][9] Because of their shared deep roots in early jazz and blues, recordings billed as **Doc Cheatham & Sammy Price** showcase a relaxed, traditional small‑group style built on swinging rhythm, blues feeling, and melodic, song‑focused improvisation rather than virtuosic displays.

Doc Cheatham was born in Nashville, Tennessee, in 1905 and initially played saxophone and trumpet in the Bijou Theatre pit orchestra before moving into touring bands and then into the orbit of major jazz leaders.[5][7] After an early break subbing for Louis Armstrong in Chicago in 1926, he went on to serve as lead trumpeter with big bands led by Sam Wooding, Cab Calloway, Benny Carter, Chick Webb, and others, later adapting to Latin music with Machito, Pérez Prado, and Marcelino Guerra, and finally reinventing himself as a lyrical small‑group soloist and singer in New York clubs such as Sweet Basil.[5][6][7] Sammy Price, born in Honey Grove, Texas, in 1908, began on alto horn before switching to piano in Dallas, where he absorbed blues and boogie‑woogie influences from Kansas City stalwarts like Pete Johnson.[1][3] After regional success as a bandleader in the Southwest and Midwest, he moved to New York in 1937 to become staff pianist and musical director at Decca Records, accompanying and producing blues, gospel, and early R&B sides for artists such as Trixie Smith, Sister Rosetta Tharpe, and Ella Fitzgerald, and leading his own Texas Blusicians band.[1][3]

When Cheatham and Price joined forces, their collaboration rested on decades of shared history in swing, blues, and traditional jazz. In 1958 Cheatham toured Europe with Price, and from the late 1960s Price led groups and projects in which Cheatham appeared as a featured soloist, often under Price’s leadership in club dates, festival appearances, and recordings marketed under both of their names.[1][7][9] Musically, Cheatham’s warm, melodic trumpet lines and understated vocals fit naturally over Price’s rolling boogie‑woogie left hand, riff‑based accompaniment, and blues‑infused solos, resulting in performances that emphasized song clarity, danceable rhythm, and mutual listening.[1][3][5][6] Their legacy together is less about a single iconic album than about the way two elder statesmen of jazz demonstrated the durability of pre‑bop language—swing, blues, boogie, and New Orleans–inspired phrasing—well into the late twentieth century, inspiring younger musicians and audiences to value melody, groove, and musical storytelling.

## Fun Facts
- Doc Cheatham’s nickname "Doc" came from his medically oriented family, who originally expected him to enter medicine rather than music; he kept the moniker even as he became a full‑time trumpeter.[5]
- Early in his career, Doc Cheatham subbed for Louis Armstrong in Chicago in 1926—a pivotal moment that both launched his professional reputation and deepened his study of Armstrong’s style.[5]
- Sammy Price started his musical life on alto horn in a boys’ band before switching to piano when his family moved to Dallas, eventually becoming a noted blues and boogie‑woogie pianist.[3]
- As Decca Records’ house pianist and musical director, Sammy Price played on or supervised an estimated 300 recording sessions, quietly shaping the sound of mid‑20th‑century blues, R&B, and gospel even when he was not the featured artist.[1][3]

## Musical Connections

### Mentors/Influences
- [[louis_armstrong|Louis Armstrong]] - Major stylistic influence on Doc Cheatham; Cheatham’s first major jazz trumpet exposure and early professional break came when he subbed for Armstrong, and he later consciously reworked his style after studying Armstrong’s recordings. (Cheatham’s early Chicago work after subbing for Armstrong (mid‑1920s) and his later melodic, Armstrong‑inspired small‑group recordings in the 1980s–1990s.) [1920s onward[5][6][8]]
- [[kansas_city_blues_and_boogiewoogie_pianists_notably_pete_johnson|Kansas City blues and boogie‑woogie pianists (notably Pete Johnson)]] - Core stylistic influence on Sammy Price; while working in Kansas City, Price absorbed blues and boogie‑woogie piano vocabulary and riff‑based arranging principles. (Price’s boogie‑woogie‑oriented recordings and his work with his Texas Blusicians, featuring strong blues and boogie grooves.) [Late 1920s–1930s[3]]
- [[cab_calloway_and_sam_wooding|Cab Calloway and Sam Wooding]] - Band leaders under whom Doc Cheatham refined his big‑band lead trumpet style and ensemble discipline before later applying those skills in small‑group contexts, including with Sammy Price. (Cheatham’s eight‑year stint in Cab Calloway’s Orchestra and earlier work with Sam Wooding’s band, which shaped his phrasing, section playing, and professionalism.) [Late 1920s–1930s[5][6][7]]

### Key Collaborators
- [[cab_calloway|Cab Calloway]] - Cheatham’s longest big‑band engagement; he served as lead trumpeter in Calloway’s orchestra, touring widely and appearing on recordings and broadcasts. (Touring and recordings with Cab Calloway’s Orchestra, including a South American tour, which solidified Cheatham’s reputation as a reliable lead trumpeter.) [Circa 1931–1939[7]]
- [[decca_records_artists_trixie_smith_sister_rosetta_tharpe_ella_fitzgerald_big_joe_turner_helen_humes_jimmy_rushing|Decca Records artists (Trixie Smith, Sister Rosetta Tharpe, Ella Fitzgerald, Big Joe Turner, Helen Humes, Jimmy Rushing)]] - As Decca’s staff pianist and musical director, Price frequently accompanied and supervised sessions for major blues and jazz vocalists, shaping early blues/R&B discography. (Hundreds of Decca sides from the late 1930s through early 1950s featuring Price as accompanist, arranger, or bandleader.) [1937–early 1950s[1][3]]
- [[texas_blusicians_including_lester_young_and_ike_quebec|Texas Blusicians (including Lester Young and Ike Quebec)]] - Sammy Price’s own band, which at times featured leading swing saxophonists; their riff‑based, blues‑heavy small‑group sound prefigured later collaborations like those with Doc Cheatham. (Decca recordings by Sammy Price and his Texas Blusicians, showcasing Price’s boogie‑woogie and blues style with horn sections.) [Late 1930s–1940s[1][3]]
- [[sidney_bechet_and_mezz_mezzrow|Sidney Bechet and Mezz Mezzrow]] - Price recorded and performed in small‑group settings with these key traditional jazz clarinet and soprano sax voices, helping sustain early jazz styles into the post‑war era. (1940s–1950s small‑group recordings pairing Price’s piano with Bechet’s and Mezzrow’s frontline work.) [1940s–1950s[1]]
- [[sammy_price|Sammy Price]] - As a pianist and bandleader, Price used Cheatham as a featured trumpeter, including on European tours and later club/festival dates, often leading to credits under both their names. (1958 European tour with Price’s group; later small‑group recordings and club dates billed as Sammy Price with Doc Cheatham or Doc Cheatham & Sammy Price.) [1958; late 1960s onward[1][7][9]]
- [[benny_goodman|Benny Goodman]] - Cheatham joined Goodman’s world‑tour band after leading his own group, which helped reintroduce him to international audiences before his later resurgence in intimate club settings. (World tour performances with Goodman, featuring Cheatham in a swing context that bridged his big‑band past with his later small‑group work.) [Mid‑1960s[4][6][7]]

### Artists Influenced

- [[ornette_coleman|Ornette Coleman]] - According to the University of Idaho’s Cheatham collection essay, Cheatham’s mentorship of younger players who later pushed stylistic boundaries included work with Ornette Coleman, exposing him to traditional melodic and rhythmic concepts.

[Mid‑20th century (general, as summarized in the collection essay)[5]]
- [[theo_croker|Theo Croker]] - Cited among musicians mentored by Cheatham; Croker has championed a hybrid style bridging tradition and contemporary influences, echoing Cheatham’s late‑career openness to new forms.
