## Biography
Marcia Ball (born March 20, 1949, in Orange, Texas) is a celebrated American blues singer, songwriter, and pianist, renowned for her vibrant blend of Texas stomp-rock, Louisiana swamp blues, and rollicking New Orleans piano. Raised in Vinton, Louisiana, in a musical family, Ball began piano lessons at age five and was deeply influenced by the New Orleans sound, particularly after attending an Irma Thomas concert in her youth. She studied English at Louisiana State University while performing in a blues-rock band, Gum, and in 1970, a car breakdown in Austin led her to immerse herself in the city's burgeoning music scene.

Ball's professional career began with the progressive country band Freda and the Firedogs, which she formed with local musicians in Austin. After the band's dissolution in 1974, she launched a solo career, signing with Capitol Records for her debut album 'Circuit Queen' and later releasing a string of acclaimed albums on Rounder and Alligator Records. Her collaborations with artists like Irma Thomas and Tracy Nelson, notably on the Grammy-nominated 'Sing It!', further cemented her reputation. Ball's energetic piano style and soulful vocals have earned her multiple Blues Music Awards, Grammy nominations, and induction into the Austin City Limits Hall of Fame. In October 2025, Ball announced her retirement from touring following a diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), marking the end of a remarkable five-decade career.
