## Biography
Lightnin' Slim, born Otis Verries Hicks on March 13, 1913, in St. Louis, Missouri, became a defining figure in Louisiana swamp blues. Moving to Baton Rouge at age thirteen, he learned guitar from his older brother Layfield and was performing in local bars by the late 1940s. His musical style was marked by grainy, expressive vocals and simple yet evocative guitar work, often accompanied by just harmonica and drums, creating a raw and haunting blues sound.

Slim began his recording career in 1954 with the single "Bad Luck Blues" for J. D. 'Jay' Miller’s Feature Records before moving to Excello Records, where he recorded for over a decade. He frequently collaborated with harmonica players such as Lazy Lester and his brother-in-law Slim Harpo, contributing to the signature swamp blues sound. After a period away from music, working in a Michigan foundry, Slim was rediscovered in 1970 and resumed performing, including notable appearances at the University of Chicago Folk Festival and the Montreux Jazz Festival. He toured Europe in the early 1970s before passing away from stomach cancer in Detroit on July 27, 1974, leaving a lasting legacy as one of swamp blues' most influential voices.
