## Biography
Mississippi Fred McDowell, born Fred McDowell in Rossville, Tennessee, likely in 1906, was the son of farmers who both died while he was young[1][2][8]. He began playing guitar at age 14, performing at local dances and events around Rossville, and later moved to Memphis in 1926, working various jobs while playing music for tips[1][8]. In 1928, he relocated to Mississippi to pick cotton and eventually settled in Como, Mississippi around 1940, where he spent decades as a farmer, performing music at local gatherings on weekends[1][2][8].

McDowell's career as a professional musician began late. In 1959, folklorist Alan Lomax and Shirley Collins recorded him during their Southern Journey field trip, bringing his distinctive North Mississippi hill country blues to wider attention[1][2][7]. His music, characterized by raw vocals and innovative slide guitar—often played with a glass slide on his ring finger—blended influences from Tennessee guitarists, Delta blues, and local juke joint rhythms[2][8]. Spirituals were also central to his repertoire, notably "You Got to Move," which gained international recognition when covered by the Rolling Stones[2]. In the 1960s, McDowell transitioned to electric guitar, becoming one of the first country blues musicians to do so[8].

McDowell toured and recorded prolifically in his final years, becoming a key figure in the 1960s blues revival and influencing generations of musicians[2][8]. He remained true to his roots, famously declaring, "I do not play no rock and roll, just the straight, natural blues." Diagnosed with cancer in 1971, he continued performing until shortly before his death in Memphis on July 3, 1972[8]. His legacy endures as a foundational artist in North Mississippi hill country blues, celebrated for his powerful slide guitar technique and authentic style[2][8].
