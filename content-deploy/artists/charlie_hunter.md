## Biography
Charlie Hunter (born May 23, 1967, in Rhode Island, USA) is an American guitarist, composer, producer, and bandleader renowned for his pioneering use of custom seven- and eight-string guitars. Raised in Berkeley, California, Hunter was introduced to the world of guitars early, thanks to his mother’s profession as a guitar repairer. His formative years included time living on a commune in Mendocino County, and he attended Berkeley High School, where he took lessons from famed rock guitarist Joe Satriani. At eighteen, Hunter moved to Paris, busking on the streets and gaining invaluable practical experience before returning to the Bay Area.

Hunter’s career began to flourish in the early 1990s when he played seven-string guitar with Michael Franti’s politically charged group, The Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy, even opening for U2’s Zoo TV Tour in 1992. He released his debut album, 'Charlie Hunter Trio,' in 1993, and soon after signed with Blue Note Records. Hunter’s innovative technique—simultaneously playing bass lines, chords, and melodies—became his signature, especially after he adopted a custom eight-string guitar designed by Ralph Novak. Throughout his career, Hunter has explored jazz, funk, blues, and beyond, collaborating with a wide range of artists and continually reinventing his sound. His discography includes both solo projects and group efforts, such as his work with the Charlie Hunter Trio, Groundtruther (with Bobby Previte), and the Grammy-nominated SuperBlue project with Kurt Elling.

Hunter’s legacy lies in his technical mastery and his role as a creative force in modern jazz and instrumental music. He is celebrated for expanding the possibilities of the guitar, influencing a generation of musicians, and supporting emerging artists as a producer and collaborator. His work continues to blur genre boundaries, making him a respected and innovative figure in contemporary music.
