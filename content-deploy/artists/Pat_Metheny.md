## Biography
Pat Metheny, born Patrick Bruce Metheny on August 12, 1954, in Lee’s Summit, Missouri, grew up in a musical family where both parents and his brother played instruments, fostering an environment rich in diverse musical influences[1][5]. He began playing trumpet at age 8, switched to guitar at 12, and by 15 was performing regularly with Kansas City’s top jazz musicians, gaining invaluable early experience[1][5]. Metheny’s career took off internationally in 1974 during a three-year collaboration with vibraphonist Gary Burton, where he developed a signature style blending horn-like articulation with advanced rhythmic and harmonic ideas, rooted in jazz tradition but always pushing forward[1]. His debut album, Bright Size Life (1975), redefined jazz guitar for a new generation, and he has since released over 30 albums, earning 20 Grammy Awards across 12 categories—a record for diversity in Grammy wins[1][2]. Metheny’s work spans solo guitar, small ensembles, large orchestras, and even ballet, incorporating elements of jazz fusion, Latin jazz, rock, and classical music[1][2][5]. A relentless innovator, he was an early adopter of synthesizers and custom guitar designs, and has maintained a rigorous touring schedule, averaging 120–240 shows annually since 1974[1]. Beyond performance, Metheny has been a dedicated educator, holding teaching positions at the University of Miami and Berklee College of Music while still in his teens, and conducting workshops worldwide[1][5]. His legacy is that of a boundary-crossing artist who has expanded the vocabulary of the guitar and contemporary jazz.
