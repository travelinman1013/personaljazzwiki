## Biography
Jessica Smyth, known professionally as Biig Piig, is an Irish singer, rapper, and songwriter born on January 22, 1998, in Cork, Ireland. Her early childhood was marked by frequent moves: at age four, her family relocated to Spain for her brother's health, where she lived until she was twelve. This bilingual upbringing, split between Ireland and Spain, shaped her multicultural identity and would later influence her music, which often features both English and Spanish lyrics. At fourteen, Smyth moved with her family to West London, where she worked various jobs, including as a late-night poker dealer, while her parents ran a pub. Music became a creative outlet during this period of transition, and she began performing at open mics and house parties, eventually building a following on SoundCloud.

Biig Piig's career gained momentum after she joined the London-based NiNE8 Collective, a group of young, DIY musicians led by Lava La Rue. Her 2017 single 'Vice City' caught the attention of the COLORS platform, leading to a widely viewed live session that significantly expanded her audience. She released a trilogy of EPs—'Big Fan of the Sesh, Vol. 1' (2018), 'A World Without Snooze, Vol. 2' (2019), and 'No Place For Patience, Vol. 3' (2019)—which showcased her blend of lo-fi hip-hop, R&B, and neo-soul. Signing to RCA Records in 2019, she continued to release acclaimed singles and EPs, including 'The Sky Is Bleeding' (2020) and her debut mixtape 'Bubblegum' (2023). Her music is characterized by its emotional intimacy, genre fluidity, and bilingual lyricism, resonating with a diverse, global audience.

Biig Piig is recognized for her innovative approach to songwriting and her ability to seamlessly blend genres and languages. Her work with NiNE8 and collaborations with artists such as Mac Wetha, Lava La Rue, and Emotional Oranges have cemented her reputation as a key figure in the contemporary UK music scene. With critical acclaim and a growing influence, Biig Piig continues to shape modern pop and alternative music through her distinctive voice and storytelling.
