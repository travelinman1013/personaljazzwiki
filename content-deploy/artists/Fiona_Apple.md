## Biography
Fiona Apple McAfee-Maggart, born September 13, 1977, in Manhattan, New York, is an American singer-songwriter renowned for her deeply personal lyrics and innovative approach to art pop. Raised between her mother’s home in New York and her father’s in Los Angeles, Apple was immersed in a creative environment from an early age, with a singer mother, actor father, and a family lineage of performers. She began classical piano lessons as a child and started composing her own songs by the age of eight, often drawing on her early experiences and emotional struggles for inspiration.

Apple’s career took off after she moved to Los Angeles at sixteen and secured a record deal with Sony. Her debut album, 'Tidal' (1996), written during her teenage years, received critical acclaim and commercial success, propelled by the Grammy-winning single 'Criminal.' Subsequent albums, including 'When the Pawn...' (1999), 'Extraordinary Machine' (2005), 'The Idler Wheel...' (2012), and 'Fetch the Bolt Cutters' (2020), showcased her evolving artistry, marked by intricate arrangements, confessional songwriting, and a willingness to experiment with structure and genre. Apple’s work has consistently earned critical praise, multiple Grammy Awards, and a devoted fanbase, cementing her legacy as a singular voice in contemporary music.

Known for her raw honesty and resistance to industry norms, Apple has influenced a generation of artists with her fearless vulnerability and genre-defying sound. Her music blends elements of jazz, art pop, and alternative rock, often featuring unconventional rhythms and poetic lyricism. Despite periods of retreat from the public eye, Apple’s impact endures, with each album release met with anticipation and acclaim.
