## Biography
The Original Pinettes Brass Band, founded in 1991 at St. Mary's Academy in New Orleans, is celebrated as the world's first and only all-female brass band. The group was formed under the guidance of band director Jeffery C. Herbert, who was inspired to create a female counterpart to his own ensemble, the Original Pinstripe Brass Band. Initially composed of about sixteen students, the Pinettes quickly became a unique presence in the male-dominated New Orleans brass band scene, performing traditional and contemporary brass band music at school events and local parades. 

Over the years, the Pinettes evolved into a multigenerational institution, weathering significant challenges such as Hurricane Katrina, which displaced many members and threatened the band's survival. Under the leadership of snare drummer Christie Jourdain, the band rebuilt and diversified, recruiting women from various New Orleans schools and backgrounds. Their perseverance paid off in 2013 when they won the Red Bull 'Street Kings' competition, earning the title 'Street Queens' and gaining widespread respect. The Pinettes have since performed at major festivals like the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival and Essence Music Festival, as well as internationally in Turkey and Switzerland. Their musical style blends New Orleans jazz, second line rhythms, and contemporary influences, championing both tradition and innovation while breaking gender barriers in brass band music.
