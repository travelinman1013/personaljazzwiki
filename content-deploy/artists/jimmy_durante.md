## Biography
James Francis 'Jimmy' Durante was born on February 10, 1893, in New York City, specifically in the Lower East Side, to Italian immigrant parents. Dropping out of school in the seventh or eighth grade, he pursued his passion for music, becoming a self-taught ragtime pianist known as 'Ragtime Jimmy.' His father, a barber, supported his early piano lessons, and by age 17, Durante was performing in Coney Island saloons like Diamond Tony’s. He joined the Original New Orleans Jazz Band around 1917–1918, the first jazz band in New York, where he innovated by interrupting instrumentals with joke songs punctuated by band responses—a style that became his trademark[1][2][3][6].

Durante's career exploded in the 1920s through vaudeville and the trio Clayton, Jackson and Durante, opening Club Durant in 1923. He transitioned to Broadway hits like *Show Girl* (1929), *Strike Me Pink* (1934), and *Jumbo* (1935), where he famously quipped 'What elephant?' while leading one onstage. His gravelly voice, Lower East Side accent, comic malapropisms, and massive nose ('Schnozzola') defined his jazz-influenced patter songs and novelty hits like 'Inka Dinka Doo' (1934, his lifelong theme, co-written with Ben Ryan). He thrived in radio (*The Jimmy Durante Show*, 1940s), TV (1950s shows), films (*It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World*, 1963), and late albums like *September Song* (1963)[2][3][5][6].

Durante's legacy endures as a beloved entertainer spanning six decades until his death on January 29, 1980, in Santa Monica, California. His warm philanthropy, signature sign-off 'Goodnight Mrs. Calabash, wherever you are,' and reintroduction via pop standards influenced generations, cementing him in adult standards (Spotify genre) with timeless charm[1][2][3].

- Signed off radio/TV shows with 'Goodnight Mrs. Calabash, wherever you are'—revealed post-1980 death as a tribute to his late first wife, Jeanne Olson[1][2].
- A judge dismissed a challenge to his late-life adoption of daughter CeCe, citing 'I've heard this man sing "Young at Heart"' to affirm his vitality[1].
- Starred as 'Schnarzan,' a Tarzan parody, in *Hollywood Party* (1934)[5].
