## Biography
Delfeayo Marsalis, born July 28, 1965, in New Orleans, Louisiana, is an acclaimed jazz trombonist, composer, producer, and educator. The son of renowned pianist and educator Ellis Marsalis Jr., and part of the celebrated Marsalis musical family, Delfeayo was immersed in jazz from an early age, often listening to his father play piano at home. He initially experimented with bass and drums before settling on the trombone in sixth grade, finding it a natural extension of his personality. Marsalis attended the New Orleans Center for Creative Arts, received classical training at the Eastern Music Festival and Tanglewood Institute, and later majored in performance and audio production at Berklee College of Music. He also earned a master's degree in jazz performance from the University of Louisville and was awarded an honorary doctorate from New England College.

Marsalis began producing records at just 17 and has since produced over 125 recordings, including works that helped define the modern acoustic jazz sound. As a trombonist, he is celebrated for his technical excellence, inventive approach, and humor, drawing inspiration from jazz greats such as J.J. Johnson, Curtis Fuller, and Tommy Dorsey. His discography as a leader includes several critically acclaimed albums, and he is also known for his work with the Uptown Jazz Orchestra, which he founded to promote the New Orleans big band tradition. In addition to his performing and recording career, Marsalis is deeply committed to music education and community engagement, notably founding the Uptown Music Theatre to train youth in New Orleans. In 2011, he and the Marsalis family received the National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Masters Award, the highest honor in American jazz.
