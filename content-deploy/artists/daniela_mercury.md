## Biography
Daniela Mercury, born Daniela Mercuri de Almeida on July 28, 1965, in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil, is a renowned singer, songwriter, dancer, producer, actress, and television presenter. Raised in a middle-class family with Italian and Portuguese roots, Mercury began her artistic journey with dance lessons at age eight and was inspired to pursue singing at thirteen after hearing the legendary Elis Regina. By the early 1980s, she was performing in local bars and on trio elétrico trucks during Salvador's vibrant Carnival, a scene traditionally dominated by male singers[4][5].

Mercury's professional career began as the lead vocalist for Cheiro de Amor (1986–1988) and as a backing singer for Gilberto Gil. She later fronted Companhia Clic before launching her solo career in 1991. Her debut album featured the hit "Swing da Cor" with Olodum, followed by the landmark release "O Canto da Cidade" in 1992, which catapulted Axé music to national prominence and established her as the genre's queen[3][4]. Mercury's energetic blend of axé, samba, reggae, and pop, paired with her dynamic stage presence, has resulted in over 12 million records sold, 24 Top 10 singles, and numerous awards, including a Latin Grammy and multiple Brazilian music honors[2][3].

Mercury's legacy extends beyond music; she is celebrated for her social commitment and advocacy, serving as an ambassador for UNICEF, UNAIDS, and UNESCO[1]. Her influence on Brazilian popular music (MPB) and Carnival culture is profound, inspiring a new generation of artists and helping to internationalize the sounds of Bahia.
