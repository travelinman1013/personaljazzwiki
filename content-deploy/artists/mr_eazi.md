## Biography
Oluwatosin Oluwole Ajibade, professionally known as Mr Eazi, was born on July 19, 1991, in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, Nigeria[1][4]. Raised in an entrepreneurial Yoruba family, Mr Eazi was exposed to music from an early age, often listening to records played by his father during breakfast[1][2]. At age 16, he relocated to Kumasi, Ghana, to study mechanical engineering at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST), where he began booking artists for college parties and recording music, notably contributing vocals to the track "My Life," which gained local popularity[1][3].

Mr Eazi's music career formally began with his debut mixtape, "About to Blow," in 2013[1][4]. He pioneered Banku music, a genre blending Ghanaian highlife with Nigerian chord progressions and rhythms, which quickly distinguished his sound. His single "Skin Tight" featuring Efya brought him international attention, followed by further success with tracks like "Leg Over" and "Bankulize"[3]. In 2017, he released "Life Is Eazi, Vol. 1 – Accra to Lagos," solidifying his reputation in the Afrobeats and Afropop scenes. Mr Eazi has also made significant entrepreneurial strides, founding emPawa Africa in 2019, an initiative to mentor and fund emerging African artists[1].

Throughout his career, Mr Eazi has been recognized for his innovative fusion of Ghanaian and Nigerian musical traditions, influencing the evolution of contemporary African pop music. His legacy extends beyond performance, as he continues to nurture new talent and expand the reach of African music globally through collaborations, mentorship, and business ventures[1][3].
