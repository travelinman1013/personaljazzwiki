## Biography
Bebel Gilberto, born Isabel Buarque de Hollanda Gilberto de Oliveira on May 12, 1966 in New York City, is a Brazilian-American singer renowned for her innovative blend of bossa nova, Brazilian jazz, and electronic music. The daughter of bossa nova pioneer João Gilberto and acclaimed singer Miúcha, Bebel was immersed in music from an early age, making her recording debut at age seven on her mother's album with Antônio Carlos Jobim and performing at Carnegie Hall with her mother and Stan Getz by age nine. Though raised between Brazil and the United States, her musical upbringing was deeply rooted in Brazilian tradition, yet always open to global influences.[5][6][8]

Bebel's solo career began in 1986 with a self-titled EP, but her international breakthrough came with the 2000 release of 'Tanto Tempo.' This album fused classic bossa nova with electronic beats, captivating a new generation of listeners and establishing her as one of the best-selling Brazilian artists in the U.S. since the 1960s. Subsequent albums, such as 'Bebel Gilberto' (2004), 'Momento' (2007), and the Grammy-nominated 'All in One' (2009), showcased her ability to seamlessly blend acoustic and electronic sounds, while her 2020 album 'Agora' reflected a period of personal loss and introspection.[1][2][4][5]

Gilberto's musical style is characterized by her smoky, intimate vocals and her modern reinterpretation of bossa nova, often incorporating elements of lounge, pop, and electronica. Her legacy lies in her role as a bridge between the classic Brazilian sound and contemporary global music, inspiring both audiences and fellow musicians with her innovative spirit and emotional depth.[1][3][4]
