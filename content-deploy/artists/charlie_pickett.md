## Biography
Charlie Pickett is an American singer, songwriter, and guitarist known for his raw blend of rock, country, blues, and punk influences. Born in Meigs County, Ohio, one of the poorest counties in the Appalachian foothills, Pickett was raised primarily in Dania, Florida, a suburb of Miami. He began playing music relatively late, picking up the guitar during his college years in the mid-1970s, inspired by the burgeoning punk movement but always grounding his sound in classic rock and blues roots[1][4].

Pickett gained local notoriety in the South Florida music scene during the 1980s, fronting bands such as the Eggs and later the MC3. His energetic live performances and genre-fusing style—drawing on the Rolling Stones, Creedence Clearwater Revival, the Flamin’ Groovies, the New York Dolls, and proto-country-rockers like the Flying Burrito Brothers—earned him a cult following and critical acclaim, though commercial success eluded him[2][5]. He released several records, including the acclaimed 'Live at the Button' and the EP 'Cowboy Junkie,' before signing with Twin/Tone Records for his LP 'Route 33.' Despite a grueling touring schedule and a devoted regional fanbase, Pickett stepped back from music in the late 1980s, only to see his legacy grow in subsequent decades as a pioneer of roots rock and jangle pop in Florida[1][2].

Pickett’s music is characterized by its 'jacked up blues' approach—melding punk’s energy with bluesy guitar work and a rootsy sensibility. His influence is felt in the South Florida rock and punk scenes, where he is remembered as a foundational figure who bridged genres and inspired a generation of musicians[2][4].
