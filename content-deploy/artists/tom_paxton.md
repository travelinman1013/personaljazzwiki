## Biography
Thomas Richard Paxton (born October 31, 1937 in Chicago, Illinois) is an American folk singer‑songwriter whose career has spanned more than six decades.[1][3] His family moved to Bristow, Oklahoma when he was ten, and he grew up there, later studying drama at the University of Oklahoma and graduating with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in 1959.[3][6] After trying summer stock theatre and a brief stint in graduate school, he joined the U.S. Army; while at Clerk Typist School at Fort Dix, New Jersey, he began writing songs on his typewriter and spent weekends traveling to New York City’s Greenwich Village, then the epicenter of the emerging early‑1960s folk revival.[1][2][7]

After his discharge, Paxton settled into the Greenwich Village scene, performing in small “basket houses” and then as a regular at the Gaslight Cafe, where he became known both for topical “singing journalist” songs and for more lyrical, personal compositions.[1][2][4] He signed as the first writer to Milt Okun’s Cherry Lane Music after impressing Okun with “The Marvelous Toy,” and in 1964 he joined Elektra Records, eventually releasing seven albums for the label and helping pioneer the move from traditional material to original singer‑songwriter folk.[1][4] His songs such as “Ramblin’ Boy,” “The Last Thing on My Mind,” and “Bottle of Wine” were widely covered, and he became a featured figure at the Newport Folk Festival and in the broader civil‑rights‑era folk movement, including participation in Freedom Summer events in 1964.[1][2][3] Throughout his career he chose to remain rooted in acoustic folk rather than embrace folk‑rock, and he later expanded into children’s music and music education.

Paxton’s clear, conversational vocal style and straightforward melodies frame lyrics that range from sharply political and satirical to tender and introspective, aligning him with the tradition of Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger while establishing a distinct songwriting voice.[1][4] His work has been recognized with major honors, including the ASCAP Lifetime Achievement Award in Folk Music in 2002 and a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award from the Recording Academy in 2009, along with multiple Grammy nominations in the 2000s for both contemporary and traditional folk albums and for children’s music.[1][2] Celebrated as one of the early architects of the modern singer‑songwriter movement, he has influenced generations of folk and acoustic artists and continues to perform and record into the 21st century, maintaining a reputation as both a committed social commentator and a master craftsman of song.[1][4]

## Fun Facts
- Paxton began writing songs on an Army typewriter while serving at Fort Dix, New Jersey, using his weekends off to commute into Greenwich Village and test new material in tiny folk clubs.[1][2][7]
- Although initially selected to join the Chad Mitchell Trio after an audition arranged by publisher Milt Okun, Paxton lost the spot because his voice did not blend well enough with the group—but the meeting led to his becoming the first songwriter signed to Cherry Lane Music.[1]
- Paxton deliberately avoided jumping on the mid‑1960s folk‑rock trend, jokingly referring to it as ‘folk rot’ and choosing to remain an acoustic folk singer‑songwriter even as the commercial market shifted.[1][2]
- Dave Van Ronk credited Paxton, rather than Bob Dylan, as the real starter of the Village ‘new song’ movement, noting that Paxton’s decision to focus on original songs—and his practice of writing one song a day as a discipline—helped redefine the expectations for folk performers.[1]

- [[the_weavers_including_pete_seeger_lee_hays_ronnie_gilbert_fred_hellerman|The Weavers (including Pete Seeger, Lee Hays, Ronnie Gilbert, Fred Hellerman)]] - Early inspirational model; Paxton has credited hearing The Weavers’ recordings as a formative experience that drew him into folk music and away from a more conventional career path. (Influence associated with albums such as “The Weavers at Carnegie Hall,” which Paxton has cited as pivotal listening.[4][5]) [Early 1950s–1960s (influence), with personal encounters later in his career.[4][5]]
- [[woody_guthrie|Woody Guthrie]] - Stylistic and ideological influence; Paxton is often placed in Guthrie’s tradition of topical songwriting and ‘singing journalism,’ and he performed at a major tribute to Guthrie at Carnegie Hall. (Harold Leventhal’s ‘A Tribute to Woody Guthrie’ concert at Carnegie Hall, January 20, 1968.[1]) [1960s onward as an artistic model; tribute performance in 1968.[1]]
- [[pete_seeger|Pete Seeger]] - Senior figure and champion of Paxton’s songs; Seeger began performing Paxton’s compositions early on, helping to introduce them to a wider folk audience. (Performed Paxton songs such as “Ramblin’ Boy” and “What Did You Learn in School Today?” in his own concerts and recordings.[2]) [Early–mid 1960s and beyond.[2]]

### Key Collaborators

(His practice of performing largely self‑written songs at venues like the Gaslight Cafe, and songs such as “The Last Thing on My Mind,” became touchstones widely covered by later artists.[1][4]) [Early 1960s onward; formative influence during the folk revival years.[1][4]]
