## Biography
Narvel Felts, born Albert Narvel Felts on November 11, 1938, near Keiser, Arkansas, is a celebrated American singer known for his distinctive soaring tenor and high falsetto. Raised in Bernie, Missouri, Felts was a self-taught guitarist who bought his first instrument with money earned from picking cotton. His musical journey began in earnest after being discovered at a high school talent show, which led to his own radio program and early recordings. Encouraged by his peers and local DJs, Felts quickly became a local sensation, performing rockabilly and country music in the 1950s.

Felts' early career was shaped by his time with The Rockets and his recordings for Sun Records, where he was mentored by Roy Orbison and Johnny Cash. Although he enjoyed modest pop success in the 1960s, his breakthrough came in the 1970s with a string of country hits, including "Drift Away" and the soulful "Reconsider Me," which became his signature song and reached number two on the U.S. country charts. Felts' ability to blend rockabilly, country, and soul set him apart, and his heartfelt performances earned him a devoted following. Despite the eventual decline in chart success after the late 1970s, Felts remained an active performer and is recognized as a pioneer in both the rockabilly and country genres.

Felts' legacy is cemented by his induction into the Rockabilly Hall of Fame and his influence on the traditional country and rockabilly scenes. Known affectionately as "Narvel the Marvel," he is remembered for his professionalism, emotional vocal delivery, and enduring contributions to American music.
