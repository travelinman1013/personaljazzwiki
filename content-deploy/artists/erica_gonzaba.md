## Biography
Erica Gonzaba Horvat, born in San Antonio, Texas, began her musical journey at the age of 7, mesmerizing audiences with her captivating voice as a singer and songwriter. She gained early local recognition as an extremely popular and in-demand performer, culminating in her crowning as the 2005 Miss Fiesta, a title she won largely for her exceptional singing talent.[1][4][6] Hailing from a Mexican-American background, Gonzaba's early career was marked by performances that showcased her charisma and vocal prowess in the Tejano and Latin music scenes.[2][5]

In 2007, Gonzaba rose to national prominence as a contestant on season 4 of the Puerto Rican reality singing competition Objetivo Fama, where she performed songs by artists such as Laura Pausini, Ana Bárbara, and Linda Ronstadt, reaching the final stages before audience elimination. During the show, she developed a romantic relationship with fellow finalist Juan Vélez, performing duets like 'Devuélveme la Vida' and appearing in his music video 'Buscando tu Sombra,' though they parted amicably in September 2007.[2] Post-show, she continued building her career in Tejano music, co-hosting the 36th annual Tejano Music Awards and debuting her single 'No Quiero A Nadie' on the Tejano Nation Podcast.[5]

Gonzaba's musical style blends Latin pop, Tejano, and regional Mexican influences, characterized by her powerful and emotive vocals. While she was reportedly working on her debut album after Objetivo Fama, her ongoing activity includes releasing new singles and hosting major events in the Tejano community, establishing her as a enduring figure in San Antonio's music scene with low mainstream popularity (Spotify: 7) but strong regional demand.[1][2][5]
