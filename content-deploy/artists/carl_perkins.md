## Biography
Carl Perkins, born on April 9, 1932, in Tiptonville, Tennessee (with some sources noting Lake City), grew up in dire poverty as the son of sharecroppers, picking cotton from age six while discovering music through a battered guitar received at Christmas and radio broadcasts of blues and gospel. He began performing in the mid-1940s at local dances and honky-tonks with his brothers Jay (guitar) and Clayton (fiddle), initially as the Perkins Brothers Band, later adding drummer W.S. 'Fluke' Holland in 1953. Inspired by Elvis Presley's Sun Records debut, they auditioned for Sam Phillips in 1954, signing with the label and pioneering **rockabilly**—a fusion of country, rhythm and blues, and gospel that Perkins helped define with his innovative guitar picking, raw vocals, and songwriting.[1][2][3][4]

Perkins exploded to fame in 1956 with 'Blue Suede Shoes,' penned on a paper bag at 3 a.m. and the first record to top Billboard's Country, R&B, and Pop charts simultaneously; tragedy struck en route to promote it when a car crash injured him severely, allowing Elvis Presley to popularize the cover. Despite setbacks including label woes, alcohol struggles (overcome in 1968), and accidents like shooting his ankle and injuring a finger, Perkins joined Johnny Cash's troupe in 1965, writing the #1 hit 'Daddy Sang Bass' and becoming a TV show regular. He formed family bands with sons Greg and Stan, released albums like *Ol’ Blue Suede’s Back*, and contributed to landmark projects including *Class of ’55* with Cash, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Roy Orbison, earning a Grammy.[1][2][3][4]

Known as the 'King of Rockabilly,' Perkins's legacy endures through his guitar style's influence on rock pioneers and covers of his songs by The Beatles ('Honey Don’t,' 'Matchbox,' 'Everybody’s Trying to Be My Baby'). Inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987 and Memphis Music Hall of Fame, he passed away on January 19, 1998, in Jackson, Tennessee, leaving a prolific catalog blending country roots with rock's fire.[1][2][3]
