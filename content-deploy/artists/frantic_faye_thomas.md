## Biography
Fannie Crawford, known professionally as Frantic Faye Thomas or Frantic Fay Thomas, was born on September 14, 1922, in Memphis, Tennessee, to Elijah Crawford, a cook. A self-taught pianist who never had formal lessons and relied on her ear, she began performing at age three and turned professional in 1940 at Detroit's 12 Horsemen Club for $3 a night plus tips, where she was discovered by showman Earl Carroll, who signed her to an $11-a-week contract and dubbed her 'Frantic Fay.' Her energetic, uninhibited style drew from boogie-woogie and jazz, influenced by the hectic war years, earning her nicknames like 'Bombshell of Mirth and Music' and 'The Hottest Piano in the West.'

Thomas toured extensively in the 1940s across the U.S., performing at venues such as McCarthy's in Milwaukee, the Show Bar in Detroit, Trainor's in Troy, New York, the Carlton in Reno, Nevada, and the Saddle & Sirloin in Bakersfield, California. In May 1949, she recorded four songs for Leon René’s Exclusive Records in Los Angeles with Red Callender on bass and Lee Young on drums: 'I'm In Town,' 'Waga-Waga' (also called 'Monkey Song'), 'I Don't Want Your Money, Honey,' and 'Lover Man.' A second session in late 1949 featured Leonard Bibb on bass and included 'Thinking Of You,' 'I Lost My Sugar In Salt Lake City,' 'I Only Want You,' and the instrumental 'Fay's Boogie.' Despite a short recording career spanning three sessions from 1946-1949, she continued performing into the 1950s in California clubs like Club Royale in San Diego and Astor's Bar in Universal City, and later in the Midwest after relocating to Detroit in the 1960s.

Thomas married Lonnie I. Riggs in 1954 and passed away in Detroit on July 5, 1978. Her lively boogie-woogie piano and vocals left a niche legacy in post-war swing and early R&B, with her songs later appearing in film soundtracks such as Lonely Hearts (2006), Second Skin (2000), and Men of Honor (2000).[1][2][3][4]
