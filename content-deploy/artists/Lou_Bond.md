## Biography
Lou Bond, born Ronald Edward Lewis in Chicago in 1945, was an American soul singer-songwriter whose career was marked by both innovation and adversity[7]. He emerged in the Memphis music scene in the late 1960s and early 1970s, eventually recording for Stax Records’ subsidiary We Produce. Bond’s self-titled album, released in 1974, stood apart from the typical Stax sound, blending classic soul with elements of folk, jazz, country, and orchestral arrangements[3][5]. His music was deeply personal and socially conscious, addressing themes of injustice, war, and hope with a magnetic vocal delivery and acoustic guitar as his primary instrument[1][10].

Bond’s musical style defied easy categorization, earning him a reputation as a 'universal soul' artist. He was backed by the Memphis Symphony Orchestra’s string section and the Horns of South Memphis on his album, creating a soundscape that was alternately spare and lush[8]. Despite his talent, Bond struggled with the pressures of the music industry and personal hardships, including childhood abuse and mental health challenges, which limited his commercial success[1]. He continued performing in Memphis coffee shops into his later years, touching the lives of those who knew him personally.

Although his work was largely overlooked during his lifetime, Bond’s legacy has grown posthumously. His music has been rediscovered and reissued, notably by Light In the Attic Records in 2010, and has influenced contemporary artists such as Outkast and Mary J. Blige, who sampled his song 'To The Establishment.' Bond passed away in 2013, but his singular blend of soul and activism continues to resonate with new generations[10].
