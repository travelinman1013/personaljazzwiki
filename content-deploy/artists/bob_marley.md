## Biography
Bob Marley, born Robert Nesta Marley on February 6, 1945, in Nine Miles, Saint Ann, Jamaica, was the son of Cedella Malcolm, a Black Jamaican woman, and Norval Sinclair Marley, a white British army captain. Marley spent his early years in rural Jamaica, absorbing local customs, storytelling traditions, and the mysticism of his maternal grandfather, a respected bush doctor. After a brief period living with his father in Kingston, Marley returned to Nine Miles before settling in Trench Town, Kingston, during his teens—a neighborhood marked by poverty and vibrant musical culture[1][2][4][5].

In Trench Town, Marley was exposed to ska, rocksteady, and American R&B, which shaped his musical style. He began his career as a teenager, recording his first single "Judge Not" in 1961. In 1963, Marley formed The Wailers with Peter Tosh and Bunny Livingston (later Bunny Wailer), blending ska, rocksteady, and reggae into a distinctive sound. The Wailers' early collaborations with producer Lee "Scratch" Perry produced seminal tracks like "Soul Rebel" and "Duppy Conqueror." Marley's embrace of Rastafarianism in the late 1960s deeply influenced his music, infusing it with spiritual and political themes. His partnership with Island Records' Chris Blackwell brought international recognition, leading to landmark albums such as "Catch a Fire," "Rastaman Vibration," and "Exodus"[1][4][5].

Marley's music, marked by its rhythmic complexity, poetic lyrics, and messages of unity and resistance, played a pivotal role in popularizing reggae worldwide. He became a global symbol of peace, social justice, and Pan-Africanism, using his platform to address issues of oppression and inequality. Marley died of cancer on May 11, 1981, but his legacy endures through his influential recordings, cultural impact, and the continued relevance of his message[1][5][7].
