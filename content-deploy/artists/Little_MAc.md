## Biography
Malcolm "Little Mack" Simmons (January 25, 1933 – October 24, 2000) was a prominent American Chicago blues harmonica player, singer, and songwriter. Born in Twist, Arkansas, Simmons grew up learning harmonica alongside his childhood friend James Cotton, a relationship that would shape his early musical development. At 18, Simmons moved to St. Louis, Missouri, where he worked on the railroad and made his stage debut with blues guitarist Robert Nighthawk.

In 1954, Simmons relocated to Chicago, Illinois, a city central to the blues tradition. There, he formed his own band and held a five-year residency at Cadillac Baby's, a well-known blues club. He began recording in 1959, releasing singles on various labels, including Chess. Simmons was also an entrepreneur, owning and managing the Zodiac Lounge in Chicago and running his own record labels, PM Records and Simmons Records, which provided platforms for other artists. After a period away from music in the 1960s to pursue ministry, Simmons returned to recording in the 1990s with acclaimed albums such as "High & Lonesome" (1995) and "Come Back to Me Baby" (1996), cementing his legacy as a vital figure in Chicago blues. He passed away in Chicago in 2000, leaving behind a legacy of energetic performances and contributions to the blues community.
