## Biography
Eric Charles Bibb, born on August 16, 1951, in New York City, grew up immersed in the folk music revival of the 1960s, thanks to his father, Leon Bibb, a prominent singer who performed on the Ed Sullivan Show and hosted the TV talent show Someone New, where young Eric played guitar in the house band at age 16. Surrounded by musical luminaries like Pete Seeger, Odetta, Josh White, Judy Collins, and Woody Guthrie as frequent house guests, Bibb received his first acoustic guitar at seven and received early guitar advice from Bob Dylan at age 11 to 'keep it simple.' His family was deeply involved in the Civil Rights Movement, with his father attending the March on Washington and meeting Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., shaping Eric's connection between music and social change. He briefly studied psychology and Russian at Columbia University before dropping out at 19 to pursue music in Europe.[1][3][4]

Bibb moved to Paris, where he met guitarist Mickey Baker, who honed his blues guitar skills, then settled in Stockholm, Sweden, immersing himself in pre-war blues and world music influences like Brazilian and West African styles. Returning to his Americana roots—blues, gospel, folk, country, and spirituals—he debuted with Ain't It Grand in 1972 and built a career over five decades, releasing over 40 albums. Key releases include Me to You (1997) with Pops and Mavis Staples and Taj Mahal, Home to Me (1999), and recent works like Dear America (2021) and Ridin' (2023), which charted highly. He has earned three Grammy nominations, including for Migration Blues (2017) and Ridin' (2023), and multiple Blues Music Awards, such as Acoustic Artist of the Year (2012, 2013).[1][2][3][4]

Now based in Helsinki, Finland, Bibb's style is a 'personal gumbo' of fingerpicking blues, ragtime, hokum, country, folk, and gospel, performed as a bluesy troubadour. His literate, historically informed songwriting addresses America's complexities—pain, shame, hope, and wonder—while touring globally and collaborating with top talents, cementing his legacy in blues and roots music.[1][2][5]
