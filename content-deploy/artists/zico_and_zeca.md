## Biography
Zico & Zeca are a legendary Brazilian sertanejo duo, formed by brothers José Bernardo da Costa (Zeca) and Antonio Bernardo da Costa (Zico), hailing from a deeply musical family in the rural interior of São Paulo state. Their journey began in the early 1950s, when both brothers moved to São Paulo in search of greater opportunities, following the path of other successful family members and contemporaries in the burgeoning sertanejo scene. Their professional debut occurred on January 1, 1953, quickly leading to a contract with Columbia Records, one of Brazil's major labels at the time. Their first 78 RPM record was released in May 1954, and their distinct vocal harmony—Zico's clear lead and Zeca's secure second voice—became their signature sound, propelling them to national fame.[1][4][5]

Throughout their career, Zico & Zeca were known for their authentic 'sertanejo raiz' (traditional country) style, marked by heartfelt lyrics and rural themes. They released a prolific catalog: 36 78 RPM records, 38 LPs, and several CDs, with hits like "Capelinha de Chico Mineiro" and "Troca Tapas" becoming classics of the genre. Their partnership lasted an extraordinary 54 years, during which they performed across Brazil, built a loyal fanbase, and maintained a steady rhythm of releases even as the music industry evolved. After a long hiatus from recording between the early 1980s and 1999, they returned with new material, reaffirming their enduring relevance.[1][4]

Zico & Zeca's legacy is foundational to the history of sertanejo music. They are celebrated not only for their longevity and consistency but also for their role in shaping the genre's sound and emotional depth. Their influence persists in the work of subsequent generations of sertanejo artists, and their story is regarded as emblematic of dedication, resilience, and the transformative power of music in rural Brazil.[1][4][5]
