## Biography
James Henry Cotton (July 1, 1935 – March 16, 2017) was a towering figure in American blues, renowned for his electrifying harmonica playing, soulful vocals, and dynamic stage presence. Born on the Bonnie Blue plantation in Tunica, Mississippi, Cotton was the youngest of eight children and was immersed in the rich musical traditions of the Mississippi Delta from an early age. Inspired by hearing Sonny Boy Williamson II (Rice Miller) on the radio, Cotton sought him out as a mentor, learning harmonica directly from the blues legend as a child. By his teens, Cotton was touring with Williamson and later joined Howlin’ Wolf’s band, launching his professional career in the early 1950s.

Cotton’s artistry flourished in Chicago after he joined Muddy Waters’ band in 1955, where he became bandleader and contributed to the group’s powerful sound for over a decade. He alternated recording duties with Little Walter and played on landmark albums such as 'At Newport 1960.' In 1965, Cotton formed the Jimmy Cotton Blues Quartet and soon after established his own full-time touring group, the James Cotton Blues Band. His harmonica work graced Muddy Waters’ Grammy-winning 'Hard Again' (1977) and collaborations with artists from Janis Joplin to B.B. King, Led Zeppelin, and Steve Miller. Cotton’s own albums, including the Grammy-winning 'Deep In The Blues' (1996), showcased his high-energy style and deep emotional connection to the blues.

James Cotton’s legacy is defined by his technical mastery, passionate performances, and the bridge he built between traditional Delta blues and modern electric blues. Inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 2006, he influenced generations of musicians and remained a vital force in blues music until his death in 2017. His nickname, 'Mr. Superharp,' reflects the enduring impact of his powerful, expressive harmonica sound.
