## Biography
Bob Marley & The Wailers were a pioneering Jamaican band whose evolution mirrored the development of reggae itself. Formed in Kingston in 1963 by Bob Marley, Peter Tosh, and Bunny Wailer, the group started as The Teenagers before cycling through several names, ultimately settling on The Wailers. Their early sound was rooted in ska and rocksteady, but as Jamaica’s musical landscape shifted, they became central architects of the reggae genre, blending soulful melodies, socially conscious lyrics, and Rastafarian themes. The group’s first major success came with the single 'Simmer Down,' which topped Jamaican charts in 1964.

The Wailers' international breakthrough arrived after signing with Island Records in 1972, leading to the release of 'Catch a Fire' and 'Burnin’.' These albums, along with relentless touring, brought reggae to global audiences. Internal differences led Tosh and Bunny Wailer to depart in 1974, after which Marley continued as Bob Marley & The Wailers, joined by the I-Threes (including Rita Marley). The band’s music, marked by hits like 'No Woman, No Cry,' 'Get Up, Stand Up,' and 'Redemption Song,' became synonymous with the reggae movement and a symbol of resistance and unity worldwide. Marley’s untimely death in 1981 cemented his legacy as a cultural and musical icon, with The Wailers’ influence enduring across generations.
