## Biography
Rare Silk was a Grammy-nominated jazz vocal group founded in Boulder, Colorado in 1978 by three local jazz vocalists: sisters Gaile and Marylynn Gillaspie and Marguerite Juenemann.[1][3] The trio initially performed as a female harmony group, drawing inspiration from the swing era of the late 1930s and early 1940s, particularly emulating the vocal styles of the Boswell Sisters and Andrews Sisters.[1] They gained early exposure through a regular public access show at KGNU, a community radio station, where they recorded three songs weekly to build their repertoire.[1] Their breakthrough came in 1980 when they opened for Benny Goodman, the "King of Swing," at Macky Auditorium in Boulder; Goodman was so impressed with their tight, precisely harmonized material that he invited them to join his tour, leading to performances at prestigious venues including Carnegie Hall, the Playboy Jazz Festival at the Hollywood Bowl, and the Aurex Jazz Festival in Japan.[1]

Seeking to modernize their sound beyond the traditional standards Goodman preferred, Rare Silk expanded to a four-part harmony group by adding male vocalist Todd Buffa, whose innovative approach to harmonies combined with the group's diverse influences created a distinctive sound that set them apart from contemporaries like Manhattan Transfer.[1] The group signed with PolyGram and released their debut album *New Weave* in 1984, which reached #2 on Billboard's Jazz Albums chart and earned two Grammy nominations—one for Todd Buffa in the Arrangement–Two or More Voices category and one for the album itself in the Best Jazz Vocal–Duo or Group category.[1][2] They continued recording, releasing *American Eyes* on the Palo Alto label in 1985, and toured extensively throughout the 1980s, traveling by van and trailer with their backup musicians.[1] The group's live performances featured perfected harmonies, choreographed sequences, and eclectic material that incorporated influences from contemporary artists like Talking Heads, David Bowie, and Culture Club alongside their jazz foundation.[1]

After nearly a decade of performing, Rare Silk disbanded in 1988 as the constant touring became more of a struggle than a source of joy.[1][2] The group's legacy influenced subsequent generations of jazz vocalists, most notably Marylynn Gillaspie, who took a 25-year hiatus from performing before returning to the music scene as a solo artist, eventually releasing her album *Secret Language* in 2014.[2]

## Fun Facts
- Rare Silk's inception in 1978 coincided with the founding of KGNU, a community radio station in Boulder, where they created a regular public access show and recorded three songs every week to build their repertoire.[1]
- The group's innovative four-part harmony approach was distinctly different from their contemporaries; while Manhattan Transfer used the standard two men, two women lineup with traditional harmonic intervals, Rare Silk combined trained musicians (Todd Buffa and Marguerite Juenemann) with self-taught vocalists (the Gillaspie sisters) who had a "street sense," creating a unique sound.[1]
- During their extensive touring in the 1980s, the group members listened to diverse contemporary music on their Walkmans while traveling by van and trailer, incorporating influences from artists like Talking Heads, David Bowie, and Culture Club into their scat singing and improvisational live performances.[1]
- Marylynn Gillaspie, a founding member, took a 25-year hiatus from performing after the group disbanded in 1988 while raising a family, before making a solo comeback and releasing her album *Secret Language* in 2014, which included lyrics she wrote for instrumental jazz compositions by Herbie Hancock and Pat Metheny.[2]
