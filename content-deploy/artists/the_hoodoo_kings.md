## Biography
The Hoodoo Kings are a blues and Cajun supergroup formed in 2001, comprised of three legendary Louisiana musicians: Eddie Bo, Raful Neal, and Rockin’ Tabby Thomas. Each member brought decades of experience and deep roots in the regional blues scene, blending their individual styles to create a sound that captures the essence of Louisiana’s musical heritage. Eddie Bo, born in New Orleans in 1930, was renowned for his barrelhouse piano style and had a career as a session musician and recording artist, scoring Top 40 R&B hits and backing icons like Ruth Brown and Joe Turner. Raful Neal, born near Baton Rouge in 1936, was a harmonica virtuoso influenced by Chicago blues greats and played with local legends such as Lazy Lester and Buddy Guy. Rockin’ Tabby Thomas, a fixture of Baton Rouge’s blues circuit, gained regional fame with his 1962 hit "Voodoo Party" and later opened his own blues club in the city.

The group’s only album, produced by Randy Labbe and released on Telarc, features a mix of original compositions and covers that pay homage to Louisiana’s rich musical traditions. Their repertoire includes tributes to New Orleans legends (such as Professor Longhair’s "Big Chief"), reinterpretations of classics by Sonny Curtis and Bob Dylan, and Crescent City originals. The Hoodoo Kings’ collaboration was marked by a strong sense of place and authenticity, aiming to introduce a new generation to the timeless sounds of Louisiana blues and R&B. Supporting musicians included guitarists Greg Hoover and Denny Breau, bassist Dan Corbett, drummer Darren Thiboutot, and backup vocalist Kelly Jones, further enriching the group’s dynamic sound.

Though their time together was brief, The Hoodoo Kings left a lasting legacy by uniting three pillars of Louisiana blues and showcasing the enduring vitality of the genre. Their work is celebrated for its musicianship, cultural resonance, and the seamless fusion of blues, R&B, and Cajun influences, making their sole album a benchmark for regional blues collaborations.
