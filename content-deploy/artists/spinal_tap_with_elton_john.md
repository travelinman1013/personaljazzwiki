## Biography
Spinal Tap is a fictional English heavy metal band created by comedians Michael McKean (David St. Hubbins), Christopher Guest (Nigel Tufnel), and Harry Shearer (Derek Smalls). The group first appeared in 1979 on Rob Reiner's ABC special 'The T.V. Show,' before gaining cult status with the 1984 mockumentary film 'This Is Spinal Tap.' The film satirized the excesses and mishaps of rock bands, blending comedy and music in a way that resonated with both fans and musicians[1][3][4].

The band’s fictional history traces their beginnings as childhood friends in London’s Squatney District, playing in early incarnations like The Thamesmen and The Dutchmen, before evolving into Spinal Tap in the late 1960s. Their early hit '(Listen To The) Flower People' marked a transition from psychedelic pop to a heavier, twin-guitar sound, which became their signature style. Over the years, Spinal Tap 'broke up and reunited' multiple times, performing at legendary venues and enduring a series of ill-fated drummers, all chronicled in their satirical lore[2][1].

Spinal Tap’s musical style parodies classic rock and heavy metal, with exaggerated lyrics, elaborate stage props, and humorous mishaps. Their legacy lies in their influence on comedy rock and their impact on real musicians, many of whom cite Spinal Tap as an inspiration for blending humor and music. Recent collaborations, such as tracks with Elton John and Paul McCartney on 'The End Continues,' further blur the line between parody and reality, cementing Spinal Tap’s place as both a comedic and musical phenomenon[1].

## Fun Facts
- Spinal Tap is famous for its running joke about drummers dying in bizarre accidents, including spontaneous combustion and gardening mishaps[2].
- The band’s amplifiers famously go 'up to eleven,' symbolizing their exaggerated approach to rock music[4].
- Spinal Tap has performed live concerts and released real albums, blurring the line between fiction and reality[1].
- The band’s fictional history includes dozens of name changes and side projects before settling on Spinal Tap[2].
