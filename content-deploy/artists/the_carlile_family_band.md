## Biography
The Carlile Family Band is a contemporary folk and Americana ensemble hailing from Curlew, a small rural town in Washington state.[3][4] The core band consists of three members: Caroline Carlile (18 years old), the frontwoman who plays guitar, banjo, and vocals; her brother JayJ Carlile (15 years old), a multi-instrumentalist proficient in fiddle, mandolin, bass, and guitar who also writes original songs; and their father Jay Carlile, who provides harmonies and plays blues harp.[4] The family occasionally features additional members including siblings, aunts, and cousins in their performances. The band performs a diverse mix of Folk, Americana, and Indie sounds across nine different instruments, ranging from box drums to banjos, and is known for their genre-bending approach and engaging stage presence filled with comedy and family harmonies.[3][4]

The Carlile Family Band's musical roots run exceptionally deep, as they are part of a multi-generational musical lineage.[2] Their grandparents owned a dance hall, and their mother performed in local bars and clubs with her country band, establishing the family's strong connection to live performance and traditional music.[2] The band's father, Jay Carlile, is the brother of Grammy Award-winning singer-songwriter Brandi Carlile, making the younger generation part of an already accomplished musical family.[2] The family's professional career began in 2019 with their first show at the Malo Grange in Republic, Washington, after which they gradually expanded their touring schedule.[2] They write, record, and produce their own original music, often working from the backseat of their motorhome while traveling.[3][4] Their songs explore diverse themes including heartache, friendship, familial love, and cowboy narratives, reflecting their lived experiences growing up in a touring musician family.[4]

The band has achieved notable recognition for their age and experience level, performing alongside established musicians and at significant venues. In January 2026, they are scheduled to perform at the Girls Just Wanna Weekend in Riviera Maya, Mexico, alongside their aunt Brandi Carlile, Shania Twain, Maren Morris, and other prominent artists.[2] They have also performed jam sessions with respected bluegrass artists such as Sierra Hull and Molly Tuttle at festivals like Telluride, Colorado, which they identified as a turning point in their career.[2]
