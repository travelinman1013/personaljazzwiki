## Biography
Peter Bocage (July 31, 1887 – December 3, 1967) was a foundational figure in early New Orleans jazz and ragtime, celebrated for his versatility as a trumpeter, violinist, and multi-instrumentalist. Born into a prominent Creole family in the Algiers neighborhood of New Orleans, Bocage began violin lessons at age thirteen and quickly joined his father's band, performing at local parties and in the vibrant Storyville district. By his early twenties, he was leading the Superior Orchestra, a popular ragtime ensemble that included Bunk Johnson, and was soon performing with many of the city’s most influential bands, such as the Onward Brass Band, Tuxedo Orchestra, and Excelsior Brass Band.

Bocage’s career was marked by collaborations with legendary musicians including Joe "King" Oliver, Louis Armstrong, Sidney Bechet, and A.J. Piron. He played a pivotal role in the development of New Orleans jazz, both as a performer and as a mentor—he is credited with teaching Louis Armstrong how to read music. Bocage’s musical style was rooted in the melodic, "orthodox" ragtime tradition, favoring lyrical phrasing over the hotter, more syncopated approaches of contemporaries like Buddy Bolden. He led the Excelsior Brass Band for a decade and later formed the Creole Serenaders, recording for the influential Living Legends series in the 1960s. In his later years, Bocage became a fixture at Preservation Hall, helping to preserve and transmit the city’s musical heritage until his death in 1967.

Bocage’s legacy endures through his recordings, compositions such as "Mama’s Gone, Goodbye," and his influence on generations of jazz musicians. His commitment to musical excellence and tradition made him a respected leader in the New Orleans music community and a vital link between ragtime, early jazz, and the brass band tradition.
