- **Origin**: Brooklyn

## Biography
Antibalas is a Brooklyn-based musical collective founded in 1997 by Martín Perna, originally conceived in Mexico City and later formed in New York. The group emerged from the vibrant Daptone scene, sharing roots and members with bands like the Soul Providers (later the Dap-Kings) and TV on the Radio. Their first performance took place in Harlem in May 1998, and the band quickly established a reputation for energetic live shows and a commitment to alternative venues, community spaces, and progressive causes. By 2000, Antibalas released their debut album 'Liberation Afrobeat Vol. 1,' followed by extensive touring in the US and Europe, and subsequent albums such as 'Talkatif' and 'Who Is This America?' solidified their place as leaders of the modern afrobeat movement.

Antibalas's musical style is deeply rooted in the afrobeat tradition pioneered by Fela Kuti, blending complex polyrhythms, horn-driven arrangements, and socially conscious lyrics. The band's sound also incorporates influences from Latin funk, jazz, and soul, reflecting the diverse backgrounds of its members and the multicultural environment of Brooklyn. Over the years, Antibalas has collaborated with a wide array of artists and contributed to Grammy-winning projects, while members have participated in the Tony Award-winning Broadway musical 'FELA!'. Their 2020 album 'Fu Chronicles,' inspired by martial arts and composed by longtime vocalist Amayo, was nominated for a Grammy for Best World Music Album.

Antibalas is recognized for its role in revitalizing afrobeat in the United States and beyond, serving as a bridge between generations and genres. The group has inspired countless musicians and bands, both through its recordings and its dynamic live performances, and continues to evolve with new music and international tours. Their legacy is marked by a commitment to artistic collaboration, community engagement, and the enduring power of afrobeat as a vehicle for social change.
