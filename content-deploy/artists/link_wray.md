## Biography
Link Wray, born Fred Lincoln Wray Jr. on May 2, 1929, in Dunn, North Carolina, emerged as one of the most influential guitarists in the history of rock music. Raised in a musical family, Wray learned bottleneck guitar as a youth after his family moved to Arizona, and by his late teens, he was performing with his brothers in country bands such as Lucky Wray and the Lazy Pine Wrangers. His early career was interrupted by military service during the Korean War, where he contracted tuberculosis and lost a lung, which limited his ability to sing but did not diminish his passion for music.

Wray's breakthrough came in 1958 with the instrumental hit "Rumble," performed by Link Wray & His Ray Men. The song's raw, distorted sound—achieved by puncturing his amplifier's speaker with a pencil—introduced the world to power chords and fuzz tone, laying the groundwork for genres like surf rock, garage, punk, and heavy metal. Despite being banned in some cities for its perceived association with juvenile delinquency, "Rumble" became a touchstone for generations of guitarists. Throughout his career, Wray experimented with styles ranging from rockabilly and surf to swamp rock and hard rock, recording prolifically both with bands and as a solo artist.

Wray's legacy is immense: he is credited with inventing the power chord and is cited as a foundational influence by artists such as Pete Townshend, Jimmy Page, Iggy Pop, and Neil Young. His innovative approach to guitar tone and recording techniques continues to inspire musicians across genres, and his work has been honored by multiple halls of fame and featured in iconic film and television soundtracks.
