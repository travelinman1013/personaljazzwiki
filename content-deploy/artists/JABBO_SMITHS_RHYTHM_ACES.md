## Biography
Jabbo Smith's Rhythm Aces was a jazz ensemble led by the virtuosic trumpeter Jabbo Smith, active primarily during the late 1920s. Formed in Chicago in 1929, the group was assembled at the request of Mayo Williams, recording director for Brunswick Records, as a direct competitor to Louis Armstrong’s Hot Five series. The Rhythm Aces recorded nineteen sides between January and August 1929, producing a body of work that was rhythmically adventurous and stylistically ahead of its time. Their recordings, such as 'Ace of Rhythm,' 'Sau Sha Stomp,' and 'Little Willie Blues,' showcased Smith’s rapid-fire trumpet technique, innovative double-time runs, and a willingness to experiment with phrasing and structure that foreshadowed later developments in jazz. Despite their musical innovation, the group’s records sold poorly and were largely forgotten by the general public, though they were highly regarded by fellow musicians and later jazz historians.

Musically, the Rhythm Aces blended hot jazz, blues, and ragtime influences, with Smith’s playing standing out for its technical brilliance and emotional intensity. The group’s style was marked by energetic ensemble work, Smith’s adventurous solos, and a rhythmic drive that pushed the boundaries of traditional New Orleans jazz. After the Rhythm Aces disbanded, Smith continued to play with top bands in Chicago and later Milwaukee, but his career never reached the same level of recognition. The group’s legacy was revived in the 1970s when European trad jazz bands rediscovered and celebrated Smith’s work, leading to new recordings and performances. Today, the Rhythm Aces are remembered as an important, if overlooked, chapter in the evolution of jazz.
