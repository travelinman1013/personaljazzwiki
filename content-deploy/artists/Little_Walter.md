## Biography
Little Walter, born Marion Walter Jacobs on May 1, 1930, in Marksville, Louisiana, was a revolutionary blues harmonica player whose innovations transformed the instrument's role in popular music. Largely self-taught, he began playing harmonica as a child, inspired by the recordings of John Lee 'Sonny Boy' Williamson. By his early teens, he was performing on the streets of New Orleans and in local clubs, quickly gaining a reputation for his prodigious talent. In the mid-1940s, Walter moved north, first to Memphis and then to Chicago, which was then the epicenter of the postwar blues scene.

In Chicago, Little Walter became a key member of Muddy Waters's band, contributing his powerful amplified harmonica sound to many of Waters's classic recordings from 1948 to 1952. Walter's innovative use of amplification allowed the harmonica to compete with electric guitars and drums, making it a lead instrument in blues ensembles for the first time. His 1952 instrumental 'Juke' became a massive hit, reaching No. 1 on the R&B charts, and launched his solo career. Throughout the 1950s, he recorded a string of influential hits, including 'My Babe,' 'Sad Hours,' and 'Boom, Boom, Out Goes the Light.' Despite his musical genius, Walter struggled with personal demons, including alcoholism and a volatile temper, which affected his relationships and career longevity.

Little Walter's impact on blues and popular music is profound. He was inducted posthumously into both the Blues Hall of Fame and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the only harmonica player to receive both honors. His expressive phrasing, technical mastery, and pioneering use of amplification set a new standard for blues harmonica, influencing generations of musicians. Walter died in Chicago on February 15, 1968, at the age of 37, but his legacy endures as one of the most important figures in blues history.
