## Biography
The Garden District Trio is a modern jazz ensemble based in New Orleans, Louisiana, led by drummer and composer David Hansen. Originally from Abbotsford, British Columbia, Canada, Hansen relocated to New Orleans in 1991, where he immersed himself in the city’s vibrant jazz tradition and began developing his own voice as a bandleader and composer. The trio, which has been active since at least the mid-1990s, has become a fixture in the New Orleans jazz scene, performing seven nights a week at Houston's Restaurant since 2006 and refining a repertoire that blends original compositions with classic jazz standards, New Orleans street beats, and a variety of jazz styles including bossa nova, funk, blues, and jazz waltz.

The core members of the Garden District Trio include David Hansen on drums, Jordan Baker on piano, and Brian Quezergue on bass, with occasional guest appearances by notable musicians such as Roland Guerin. Their 2020 album 'Upward' showcases Hansen’s all-original material and highlights the trio’s ability to meld disparate influences into a cohesive, groove-driven sound. The album reached No. 72 on the JazzWeek charts and has received national airplay, further cementing the group’s reputation for accessible yet sophisticated jazz that pays homage to both New Orleans traditions and the broader jazz canon. The trio’s performances are noted for their improvisational flair, melodic focus, and rhythmic inventiveness, drawing inspiration from classic Blue Note recordings and the work of artists like Horace Silver.

Over more than two decades, the Garden District Trio has contributed to the ongoing evolution of New Orleans jazz, blending tradition with innovation and serving as a platform for both established and emerging musicians. Their legacy is defined by a commitment to live performance, a deep respect for the city’s musical heritage, and a willingness to explore new directions within the jazz idiom.
