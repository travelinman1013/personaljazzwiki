## Biography
Jingle Cats is a novelty recording project created by Los Angeles–based producer and musician **Mike Spalla**, built around carefully edited recordings of real cats “singing” Christmas carols and pop tunes.[1][3] Spalla began experimenting with cat sounds in the early 1990s, assembling thousands of recorded meows, screeches, and growls and pitch‑matching them to familiar melodies; his first version of “Jingle Bells” using only cat sounds circulated to radio stations before a full album was conceived.[1] The breakthrough came with the release of the debut album *Meowy Christmas* in 1993, which used more than 1,000 separate cat vocalizations to construct 20 melodies and quickly attracted extensive U.S. media coverage, selling out a week before Christmas and reaching the *Billboard* charts.[1][3] 

On the strength of that success, Jingle Cats rapidly expanded into a small multimedia franchise. Spalla followed *Meowy Christmas* with *Here Comes Santa Claws* in 1994, reportedly crafted from about 3,000 new meows and featuring his own cats Sprocket, Twizzler, Binky, Cheese Puff, Clara, Cueball, Graymer, Max, and Petunia as the “vocalists,” while he provided accordion and his dog Klippy Kloppy supplied background sounds.[1] The project spawned spin‑off series *Jingle Dogs* (beginning with *Christmas Unleashed* in 1995) and *Jingle Babies*, additional Jingle Cats albums such as *Rhythm and Mews* (2002) and *First Meowel* (2009), multiple VHS and DVD releases, a Japanese video game, and licensed merchandise including Hallmark musical greeting cards.[1][3] Critically, Jingle Cats has been framed as the quintessential 1990s holiday novelty: derided by some reviewers as grating noise but embraced by others as a charmingly absurd blend of audio collage, animal sounds, and Christmas kitsch.[1][3] Its enduring presence in seasonal pop culture—ranging from holiday radio rotations to online traditions like the Yogscast “Jingle Jam” streams—has secured Jingle Cats a lasting legacy as one of the most recognizable examples of animal‑sound novelty music.[1]
