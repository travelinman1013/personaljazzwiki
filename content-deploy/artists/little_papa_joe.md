## Biography
Little Papa Joe was the earliest recording alias of American blues guitarist and singer **Jody Williams** (born Joseph Leon Williams, February 3, 1935, Mobile, Alabama; died December 1, 2018, Munster, Indiana). Raised in Chicago after his family moved north, Williams grew up amid the burgeoning postwar electric blues scene, absorbing the sounds of artists on the Chess and Vee‑Jay labels.[5][6] By the early 1950s he was playing guitar professionally around Chicago, quickly earning a reputation for his sharp tone, inventive chord voicings, and fluid single‑note lines, which stood out even in a city crowded with blues talent.[6][1]  

Williams made his recording debut as **Little Papa Joe** in December 1955 with the upbeat R&B/blues single “Lookin’ for My Baby,” backed with “Easy Lovin’,” released on Al Benson’s Blue Lake label.[1][6][5] This disc featured sax‑driven arrangements typical of mid‑1950s Chicago R&B, with Williams contributing both vocals and guitar, and it remains the primary release under the Little Papa Joe name.[6][5][7][8] Although Blue Lake folded soon after, cutting short any follow‑up singles as Little Papa Joe, Williams’ career accelerated under other aliases (notably Little Joe Lee and Sugar Boy Williams) and, more importantly, as a first‑call session guitarist in Chicago; his biting lead work on Bo Diddley’s “Who Do You Love?” and many Chess sides became highly influential.[6][1][5]  

Stylistically, the Little Papa Joe recordings sit at the crossroads of **Chicago blues and mid‑’50s R&B**—up‑tempo shuffles, strong backbeat, saxophone leads, and Williams’ distinctive, slightly dissonant guitar fills.[1][6] While the Little Papa Joe name itself did not develop a large independent legacy, those early sides capture Williams at the outset of a career that would later be rediscovered and celebrated when he returned to music around 2000 after decades working as an electronics engineer.[1][6][5] Today, collectors and blues historians value the Little Papa Joe single as an important document of Jody Williams’ formative sound and as a glimpse of a gifted guitarist just before he became one of Chicago blues’ most admired but often under‑credited stylists.[6][5][7]

## Fun Facts
- Jody Williams’ very first record as a leader was issued under the alias **Little Papa Joe**, making that name historically tied to his debut single “Lookin’ for My Baby” / “Easy Lovin’.”[1][6][5][7]
- Because Blue Lake Records closed shortly after releasing the Little Papa Joe single, at least one additional track from that session (“Groan My Blues Away”) remained unreleased for years, making the original 45 especially prized by collectors.[5][6]
- Although he was an in‑demand guitarist in the 1950s and 1960s, Williams left music by the late 1960s, trained in electronics, and worked for more than two decades as a technical engineer for Xerox before returning to the blues scene around 2000.[1][5][6]
- The name **Little Papa Joe** appears only on a small part of Williams’ discography—most of his later solo releases used other aliases such as Little Joe Lee and Sugar Boy Williams—so many fans of his famous guitar work do not realize that Little Papa Joe is the same musician.[1][5][6][7]
