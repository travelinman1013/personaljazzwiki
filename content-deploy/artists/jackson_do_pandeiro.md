## Biography
Jackson do Pandeiro, born José Gomes Filho on 31 August 1919 in Alagoa Grande, Paraíba, Brazil, was the son of coco singer Flora Maria da Conceição (known as Flora Mourão), whose performances at local parties immersed him early in the rhythms of coco and other Northeastern folk forms.[1][5][6] As a boy he moved to Campina Grande, where he worked by day as a shoeshine boy and bakery helper and played music at night in venues such as the Cassino Eldorado, absorbing blues, jazz, chorinho, maxixe, rumba, tango and samba alongside regional styles.[1][3][6] Initially a zabumba and drum player, he eventually adopted the pandeiro professionally, taking the stage name “Jackson” from American western-film star Jack Perry and becoming “Jackson do Pandeiro” as his virtuosity on the instrument grew.[1][3] His first successes came in the late 1930s and 1940s in Paraíba, performing in pastoril groups, radio orchestras and the duo Café com Leite with pandeirista Zé Lacerda, before a move to Recife in 1948 to work with Rádio Jornal do Commercio solidified his reputation across the Northeast.[1][3]

In 1953, at age 35, Jackson recorded his first 78 rpm single for Copacabana, featuring “Forró em Limoeiro” (by Edgar Ferreira) and “Sebastiana” (by Rosil Cavalcanti), which sold impressively and launched his national career.[1][2][3] Moving to Rio de Janeiro in 1954 at Copacabana’s invitation, he released a string of 78s and LPs such as *Jackson do Pandeiro com Conjunto e Coro* (1954) and *Forró do Jackson* (1956), and became a star of radio, recordings and carnival, recording hits including “Forró em Caruaru,” “O canto da ema,” “Lapinha de Jerusalém,” “24 de dezembro,” “Quem não chora não mama” and “Chiclete com banana” (the latter co-written with Gordurinha and later re-popularized by Gilberto Gil).[1][2][5] His style fused forró, baião, coco, rojão, xote, samba and marchas with Afro-Cuban and Caribbean elements, underpinned by a uniquely subtle rhythmic division in his voice and pandeiro playing that critics hailed as some of the most sophisticated in Brazilian popular music.[2][4][5] Throughout nearly three decades of recording, with more than 30 LPs and hundreds of tracks spanning multiple genres, he became known as “O Rei do Ritmo” (“The King of Rhythm”), sharing with Luiz Gonzaga the role of bringing Northeastern music to national prominence.[1][2][3][5]

Jackson’s later years saw him continue to record and perform widely, including influential albums such as *O Cabra da Peste* (1966), often alongside his stage and life partner Almira Castilho, with whom he formed a celebrated duo on radio, television and in live shows.[1][6] His final studio LP, *Isto é que é Forró!* (also listed as *Isto que é forró*), appeared in 1981, closing a recording career that mapping projects by the Museu de Arte Popular Paraibana estimate at over a hundred sambas, rojões, baiões and marchas, among many other rhythms.[1][5] Jackson died in Brasília on 10 July 1982, but his impact on Brazilian music only deepened posthumously: critics and musicians cite his phrasing as an influence on bossa nova pioneer João Gilberto, his repertoire has been revisited by artists like Gilberto Gil and Tom Zé, and his status as a foundational figure of Northeastern popular music is continually reaffirmed in biographies, tributes and reissues.[1][2][5][6]

## Fun Facts
- Jackson’s stage name was inspired by his love of western films: he adapted the name of cowboy-film star Jack Perry to “Jack do Pandeiro,” which eventually evolved into “Jackson do Pandeiro.”[3]
- Before fame, he worked as a shoeshine boy and bakery assistant in Campina Grande during the day while playing music at night in venues like the Cassino Eldorado, where he absorbed jazz, blues and Latin rhythms.[3][6]
- Early in his career, when he replaced another performer in a pastoril troupe in Campina Grande, his energetic dancing earned him the nickname “Palhaço Parafuso” (“Screw Clown”).[1]
- A survey by the Museu de Arte Popular Paraibana counted more than 400 recordings in Jackson’s career, including at least 117 sambas, 72 rojões, 42 baiões and 40 marchas, showcasing his extraordinary stylistic range.[5]

(Live shows at Cassino Eldorado where Jackson played and listened nightly, expanding his rhythmic vocabulary.) [Late 1930s–1940s]

### Key Collaborators
- [[zé_lacerda|Zé Lacerda]] - Fellow pandeirista who partnered with Jackson in the duo Café com Leite, one of Jackson’s earliest successful projects and a vehicle for his breakthrough around 1939. (Duo Café com Leite performances in Paraíba and revived later with songwriter Rosil Cavalcanti; early popular shows that helped establish Jackson’s reputation.) [From 1939 (initial success) and subsequent revivals in the 1940s]
- [[rosil_cavalcanti|Rosil Cavalcanti]] - Songwriter and close partner who reactivated the duo Café com Leite with Jackson in João Pessoa and composed “Sebastiana,” Jackson’s first major hit on record. (“Sebastiana” (Jackson’s early hit recorded in 1953); performances as Café com Leite in João Pessoa and other Northeastern cities.) [1940s–early 1950s (especially leading up to the 1953 recording)]
- [[edgar_ferreira|Edgar Ferreira]] - Composer of “Forró em Limoeiro,” the other side of Jackson’s debut 78 rpm disc, contributing a defining early success to Jackson’s discography. (“Forró em Limoeiro” (1953), recorded together with “Sebastiana” on Jackson’s first commercial release.) [Early 1950s (notably 1953 recording)]
- [[gordurinha|Gordurinha]] - Co-composer with Jackson of the samba “Chiclete com banana,” which became one of Jackson’s signature songs and a landmark in the fusion of samba with Northeastern rhythms.

- [[bezerra_da_silva|Bezerra da Silva]] - Jackson served as artistic director and instrumentalist on Bezerra da Silva’s first album, guiding its sound and contributing his rhythmic expertise. (Album “O Rei do Coco” (1976), for which Jackson was artistic director and played on all tracks.) [1976]

### Artists Influenced
- [[joão_gilberto|João Gilberto]] - Jackson’s sophisticated rhythmic division and phrasing are cited as a reference for João Gilberto’s approach; sources state that Gilberto learned aspects of rhythmic division from Jackson, informing bossa nova’s subtle syncopation. (General influence on João Gilberto’s vocal and guitar phrasing rather than a specific collaboration; part of the rhythmic foundation of early bossa nova recordings.) [1950s–1960s (formative years of bossa nova)]
- [[gilberto_gil|Gilberto Gil]] - Re-recorded “Chiclete com banana,” helping to reintroduce Jackson’s work to new audiences and acknowledging his importance in blending Northeastern rhythms with samba and pop. (Gilberto Gil’s version of “Chiclete com banana,” which revived and recontextualized Jackson’s 1959 hit.) [From late 1960s–1970s onward (period of Gil’s recordings and tributes)]
- [[tom_zé|Tom Zé]] - Avant-garde musician who openly honored Jackson, dedicating a 1999 album to him and drawing on his experimental rhythmic sensibility and genre-crossing approach. (Album dedicated to Jackson do Pandeiro (released 1999), acknowledging Jackson as a key rhythmic and conceptual influence.) [1990s (notably 1999 homage) and beyond]
- [[alceu_valença_and_later_northeastern_mpbforró_artists|Alceu Valença and later Northeastern MPB/forró artists]] - Artists from the Northeast who cite Jackson as a foundational figure in bringing forró, coco and related rhythms into mainstream Brazilian music, influencing their own rhythmic treatment and repertoire. (General influence reflected in Alceu Valença’s forró- and xote-inflected songs and in numerous tributes and TV specials where Valença and others discuss Jackson’s legacy.) [1970s onward]
