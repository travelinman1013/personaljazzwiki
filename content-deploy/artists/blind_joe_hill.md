## Biography
Blind Joe Hill, born January 7, 1931, in Pennsylvania, United States, with an unknown birth name, was adopted around 1940 and named Joe Thomas Hill by his stepparents, including adoptive father Thomas Hill, a coal miner. He grew up in the Dunbar, West Virginia area and later became associated with Akron, Ohio, where he developed his musical skills amid the blues scene. Blind from a young age, Hill initially played with bands but grew frustrated with unreliable members, leading him to pioneer a one-man band setup in the 1950s, performing guitar, harmonica, drums, and vocals simultaneously.[1][2][5]

Active from the 1950s through 1998, Hill's career featured his craggy, powerful vocals backed by self-accompaniment on guitar, bass, and drums, firmly in the one-man blues band tradition. He styled his music after influential one-man band pioneers Joe Hill Louis and Doctor Ross, blending country blues and juke joint styles. Hill recorded two albums under his own name—on Barrelhouse (1976) and L+R (1983)—and appeared on the 1985 American Folk Blues Festival tour in Europe. He gigged regularly, including at the Starvation Cafe in Fontana, California, in the early 1980s, and broadcast on Chicago radio in 1972.[1][3][5]

Hill remained one of the last practitioners of the one-man blues band style until his death on November 17, 1999, in Los Angeles, California, at age 68, where he was cremated. His legacy endures through rare recordings and as a testament to blues resilience, capturing the raw, independent spirit of mid-20th-century American blues musicians.[1][5]
