## Biography
Tim O’Brien & Ben Winship are an occasional songwriting and recording pairing rather than a permanent duo, bringing together two respected figures from the modern acoustic and bluegrass worlds. O’Brien, a Grammy‑winning Americana and bluegrass multi‑instrumentalist and singer long associated with the progressive yet tradition‑minded band Hot Rize, has been nudging folk and bluegrass forward since the late 1970s with his distinctive tenor voice, mandolin and fiddle work, and prolific songwriting.[1] Winship, a self‑made mandolinist, singer, songwriter, and producer based in the Northern Rockies, has built a career “behind the potato curtain and under the radar of commercial music,” carving out a niche in acoustic string‑band and old‑time–influenced music through touring, studio work, and community‑minded projects in Idaho and the greater mountain region.[7][8]

O’Brien grew up in Wheeling, West Virginia, absorbing Beatles‑era pop and then immersing himself in Doc Watson, James Taylor, and the blues before moving into bluegrass and old‑time music, eventually co‑founding Hot Rize in Colorado in the late 1970s.[1][2] His work blends traditional bluegrass with singer‑songwriter craft, Celtic and old‑time influences, and adventurous covers, and his songs such as “Nellie Cane” and “Ninety Nine Years” have become widely covered modern standards in the jam‑grass and acoustic communities.[1] Winship’s career has centered on mandolin‑led string‑band music, songwriting in an “old‑timey” style, and deep engagement with American roots traditions, both on his solo projects (such as *Toolshed* and *Acorns*) and with bands like the Growling Old Men; critics note that he writes in a vein akin to the traditionalist yet progressive approach associated with O’Brien’s circle.[5][7][8] Their collaboration, exemplified by the co‑written 2024 holiday single “Santa Ate a Gummy,” draws on shared bluegrass, newgrass, and old‑time sensibilities, using acoustic instrumentation, narrative lyrics, and humor to create modern songs firmly rooted in the string‑band tradition.[2][3]

Together and separately, O’Brien and Winship represent a bridge between traditional Appalachian and Western string‑band music and contemporary acoustic songwriting. O’Brien’s decades of touring, recording, and mentoring within bluegrass and Americana have made him a touchstone for younger progressive pickers, while Winship’s work as a performer, studio owner, and educator in the Teton region—including co‑founding Targhee Music Camp—has helped cultivate regional acoustic scenes and pass on mandolin‑ and ensemble‑playing traditions to new generations.[4][7][8] Their joint work is a small but telling intersection of two careers devoted to sustaining and subtly updating the bluegrass and old‑time lineage through thoughtful songs and collaborative, community‑oriented musicianship.[2][3][4][7][8]

## Fun Facts
- Tim O’Brien’s song catalog includes modern bluegrass standards like “Nellie Cane” and “Ninety Nine Years,” which have been adopted into the repertoires of jam‑oriented acts such as Phish and Punch Brothers, illustrating his reach beyond traditional bluegrass circles.[1]
- Hot Rize, the band that gave Tim O’Brien his early national visibility, built a reputation not only for strong picking but also for playful stage presentation, including intentionally “obnoxious” ties and occasional use of electric bass and effects within an otherwise traditional aesthetic.[1]
- Ben Winship describes himself as working “behind the potato curtain,” a tongue‑in‑cheek reference to his Idaho‑ and Teton‑region base and his choice to operate largely outside mainstream commercial music channels.[7][8]
- Ben Winship and Tim O’Brien co‑wrote the humorous holiday song “Santa Ate a Gummy,” which tells of Santa accidentally consuming a “special” gummy on Christmas Eve, leading to chaotic detours—a lighthearted twist on both Christmas music and modern acoustic songwriting.[2][3]
