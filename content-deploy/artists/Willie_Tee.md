## Biography
Willie Tee, born Wilson Turbinton on February 6, 1944 in New Orleans, Louisiana, was a pivotal figure in the evolution of New Orleans funk, soul, and R&B. Raised in the Calliope Projects, Tee was surrounded by musical influences from an early age, including the legendary Neville Brothers who lived nearby. He was deeply inspired by the vibrant local scene, absorbing elements of bebop, rhythm & blues, and the distinctive street parade rhythms of New Orleans[1][3].

Tee began recording as a teenager for AFO Records and quickly made a name for himself with hits like "Teasin' You" and "Walking Up a One-Way Street" for Atlantic Records in the mid-1960s. His band, Willie Tee & the Souls, played iconic venues such as the Apollo Theater and Bourbon Street, sharing stages with major soul artists of the era[1][3][6]. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Tee formed the Gaturs, an instrumental funk group whose self-produced psychedelic funk tracks became staples of the New Orleans sound. His most enduring legacy, however, may be his work with the Wild Magnolias, for whom he wrote, arranged, and co-produced groundbreaking albums that fused Mardi Gras Indian chants with funk and jazz, introducing this unique style to a global audience[1][3].

Throughout his career, Tee's expressive keyboard work and innovative arrangements earned him recognition as a true architect of New Orleans music. His influence extended into hip-hop, with artists like the Geto Boys and Sean "P Diddy" Combs sampling his compositions. Tee's music remains celebrated for its blend of danceable grooves, soulful melodies, and cultural authenticity, securing his place as a foundational figure in American music history[3][6].
