## Biography
David Lee Carson, known as Reverend Goat Carson, was a multifaceted artist born as a musician, actor, writer, and political activist. He gained recognition in the music scene by playing blues in coffee houses during the Beat Generation era and opened for his hero Lightnin' Hopkins in Houston, where Hopkins tipped his hat to him after a strong performance. Carson's career expanded through collaborations with legends like Bob Dylan, Willie Nelson, Eric Clapton, Ani DiFranco, and Terence Blanchard, embodying classic blues and jazz rooted in improvisation as a spiritual connection to the people.[1]

In 1992, Carson ran for U.S. President with the slogan 'We Want Our Money Back!' alongside Joe Walsh as his vice presidential running mate, garnering 100,000 votes against Bill Clinton. A pivotal moment came at the Miccosukee Arts and Crafts Festival when a Cherokee medicine man recognized him as 'Wolf Clan,' known for teaching, healing, and spiritual vocations, leading to his adoption into the Cherokee tribe. He contributed to the Grammy-winning album 'City That Care Forgot' (2008) with Dr. John, earning Best Contemporary Blues Album, and released his own CD 'Jamestown to Jonestown' (2011). His style blended blues, jazz, poetry, and activism, influenced by visions and archetypes, promoting tolerance as an instructor at the New Orleans School of the Imagination.[1][3]

Carson appeared as himself in the HBO series 'Treme' and the documentary 'The United States of HooDoo.' He was featured in Hans Weisethaunet's book 'Authenticity Revisited: The Rock Critic and the Changing Real' and honored by the Backstreet Museum for White Buffalo Day celebrations. Reverend Goat Carson passed away, leaving a legacy as a New Orleans cultural figure, master of barbecue, medicine man, and voice for political hypocrisy, especially post-Hurricane Katrina.[1][3][4]
