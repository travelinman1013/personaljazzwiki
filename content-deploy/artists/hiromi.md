## Biography
Hiromi Uehara was born on March 26, 1979, in Hamamatsu, Japan, and began her musical journey at age six under the guidance of piano teacher Noriko Hikida, who uniquely taught her to play based on emotions by announcing colors. At age eight, Hikida introduced her to jazz, sparking an immediate connection to the music of Oscar Peterson and Erroll Garner. Her prodigious talent became evident early—at fourteen, she performed with the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra, and at seventeen, she met her hero Chick Corea by chance in Tokyo and was invited to perform at his concert the next day. After working as a jingle writer for Japanese companies including Nissan, she enrolled at Berklee College of Music in Boston in 1999, where she was mentored by jazz legend Ahmad Jamal and signed to the Telarc label before graduation.

Hiromi's international career launched with her 2003 debut album "Another Mind," which shipped gold in Japan and was named Jazz Album of the Year by the Recording Industry Association of Japan. Throughout the 2000s, she established herself as a virtuosic and innovative force in jazz, releasing albums such as "Brain" (2004) and "Spiral" (2006), while forming the group Hiromi's Sonicbloom with bassist Tony Grey, drummer Martin Valihora, and guitarist David Fiuczynski. In 2011, she won a Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Jazz Album as part of the Stanley Clarke Band, and subsequently led her acclaimed Trio Project with contrabass guitarist Anthony Jackson and drummer Simon Phillips, producing four albums including "Voice" (2011), "Move" (2012), "Alive" (2014), and "Spark" (2016), with the latter reaching number one on the U.S. Billboard Jazz Album charts.

Known for her virtuosic technique, energetic live performances, and fearless blending of stride, post-bop, progressive rock, classical, nu jazz, and fusion, Hiromi refuses to define herself or her music by genre, preferring to let audiences interpret her work. Her artistry has earned recognition from major outlets including The New York Times and NPR, and she has performed at the world's most esteemed jazz festivals including Montreux, Umbria, North Sea, Newport, and Monterey. In 2021, she achieved a career milestone by performing at the opening ceremony of the Tokyo Olympics, cementing her status as one of the most exciting and influential pianists in contemporary jazz.
