## Biography
Alabaster DePlume is the stage name of Manchester-born musician, poet, and activist Angus (Gus) Fairbairn, who emerged from the UK’s DIY and avant‑jazz scenes with a distinctive blend of jazz, spoken word, and performance poetry.[2][3][4] Born in 1980 or 1981 in Manchester, England, he initially made “jagged, noisy music” with his brothers before taking up the saxophone in 2007 and learning largely by ear rather than through formal conservatory training.[2][3] In his early twenties he hosted jam nights in South Manchester and adopted the name Alabaster DePlume from a misheard insult shouted from a passing car, a chance moment that captured the playful, self‑effacing spirit he would bring to his later work.[2] Moving between Manchester and London, he cultivated a grassroots following through late‑night sessions, theatre collaborations, and community‑focused projects that emphasized vulnerability, improvisation, and human connection over technical polish.[3][4]

After relocating to London, Fairbairn became closely associated with the Total Refreshment Centre in Hackney, where he worked, curated, and led monthly improvisational nights under the name Peach, bringing together rotating ensembles of musicians to fuse jazz and spoken word.[2] He released the album *Peach* in 2015 via Debt Records, followed by *The Corner of a Sphere* (2018), gradually attracting attention within the UK’s left‑field and avant‑jazz communities.[1][2] His breakthrough came with the instrumental collection *To Cy & Lee: Instrumentals Vol. 1* (2020) on International Anthem, inspired by and dedicated to two musicians with learning disabilities he befriended while working with the Manchester charity Ordinary Lifestyles.[2] The album’s gentle, breathy saxophone lines and atmospheric harmonies earned critical praise and widened his international audience.[2] He consolidated this reputation with *Gold – Go Forward in the Courage of Your Love* (2022), recorded at the Total Refreshment Centre using deliberately under‑rehearsed ensembles to encourage spontaneity and interpersonal responsiveness—a process that critics highlighted as central to his ethos.[2][4] Subsequent releases such as *Come with Fierce Grace* (2023) continued to develop his blend of spiritual jazz textures, folk‑like melodies, and spoken affirmations.[2][4]

Artistically, DePlume is known for circular saxophone melodies, warm, sometimes fragile tone, and compositions that oscillate between serene, meditative passages and vehement, politically charged statements.[2][4][5] His work often carries overt sociopolitical intent, with pieces such as “I Was Gonna Fight Fascism” and the video for “What’s Missing”—which incorporates Salvador Allende’s final public speech—foregrounding anti‑fascist and humanist themes.[2] At the same time, he frames his performances as communal rituals, frequently repeating phrases like “Don’t forget you’re precious” to dismantle cynicism and affirm shared value.[4][5] Critics at outlets including NPR, Pitchfork, and The Observer have described him as a key figure in the contemporary London/UK avant‑jazz renaissance, emphasizing his “openness,” “people‑first” creative process, and commitment to transparency about how and why his work is made.[3][4][5] Though still in mid‑career, his influence is felt in the way he bridges experimental jazz, community arts practice, and activist performance, modeling a form of music‑making that treats vulnerability, collaboration, and social care as core compositional tools rather than afterthoughts.[3][4][6]

## Fun Facts
- His stage name “Alabaster DePlume” originated from a misheard insult shouted from a passing car—a “rude tirade” whose garbled phrasing he adopted rather than choosing a conventional artist name.[2]
- He did not begin playing saxophone until around 2007 and developed his idiosyncratic style largely by ear during late‑night jam sessions, prioritizing emotion and communication over traditional technical training.[2][3]
- For the album *Gold – Go Forward in the Courage of Your Love*, he intentionally avoided rehearsing the band thoroughly, bringing different musicians into the studio each day and giving them minimal preparation so they had to “look up and respond to each other” instead of relying on polished material.[2]
- Before his international breakthrough, he worked with the Manchester charity Ordinary Lifestyles, making music with adults with learning disabilities; two of those collaborators, Cy and Lee, are honored in the title and material of *To Cy & Lee: Instrumentals Vol. 1*.[2]
