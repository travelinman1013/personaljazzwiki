## Biography
The Messthetics and James Brandon Lewis is a boundary‑pushing collaborative project uniting Washington, D.C.–based instrumental trio The Messthetics with Brooklyn tenor saxophonist James Brandon Lewis. Emerging from overlapping avant‑jazz, punk, and experimental rock scenes, the quartet first came together onstage at New York’s Winter Jazzfest in early 2019, where Lewis sat in with the trio and the chemistry immediately suggested a full‑fledged band rather than an ad hoc session.[2][6] Built around the former Fugazi rhythm section of bassist Joe Lally and drummer Brendan Canty, plus guitarist Anthony Pirog, The Messthetics had already been exploring high‑energy, improvisation‑driven rock on two albums for Dischord Records, while Lewis had forged a reputation as one of the most distinctive tenor voices of his generation, blending deep jazz history with raw, punk‑like intensity.[3][4][7]

The collaboration deepened after Pirog’s guest appearances on Lewis’s albums “No Filter” (2017) and “An UnRuly Manifesto” (2019), and Lewis began joining The Messthetics whenever they played Brooklyn, further solidifying their shared language.[2] Their studio debut as a unit, the 2024 album “The Messthetics and James Brandon Lewis” on the historic Impulse! label, was written and arranged with Lewis at the center from the outset, rather than as an add‑on to an existing trio.[1][2][4] Critics have highlighted the record’s fiery yet focused blend of free jazz, post‑punk drive, and intricate composition, describing a group that chases energy and forward motion more than any single genre, and positioning the quartet as a vivid example of how jazz improvisation can collide with DIY punk ethos in the 21st century.[2][6][8]

Musically, the project is marked by Canty and Lally’s disciplined but explosive groove, Pirog’s virtuosic and textural guitar work, and Lewis’s brawny, vocal‑like tenor sound, which moves fluidly from lyrical melodies to overblown cries. Reviewers and the musicians themselves note that the quartet treats improvisation as an engine for narrative and intensity rather than abstraction for its own sake, resulting in pieces that can feel like tightly wound rock songs opening into open‑ended jazz explorations.[2][6][8] While still early in its discography, the collaboration has already been framed as a significant step in Lewis’s ongoing effort to blur the boundaries between jazz tradition, experimental music, and punk, and as an evolution for The Messthetics from a power trio into a full‑band concept with expanded harmonic and melodic possibilities.[2][4][7]

## Fun Facts
- The spark for The Messthetics and James Brandon Lewis came when Lewis sat in with the trio at NYC Winter Jazzfest in 2019; after that, he would often join them whenever they played Brooklyn, gradually turning a casual sit‑in situation into a functioning band.[2][6]
- Before officially recording as a quartet, their studio chemistry was tested on the track “Fear Not,” recorded with The Messthetics for Lewis’s 2023 album “Eye of I,” which the group later described as a template for how they could work together in the studio.[2][8]
- The Messthetics’ rhythm section, Joe Lally and Brendan Canty, are best known from the influential post‑punk band Fugazi, meaning the quartet effectively fuses a classic D.C. punk backbone with a leading voice in contemporary jazz saxophone.[2][3]
- Although the group’s 2024 album appears on the iconic jazz label Impulse!, both Lewis and the band emphasize that they are not chasing a specific genre; Lewis has described their approach as “chasing energy” and embracing change rather than fitting neatly into jazz or rock categories.[2][6]

- [[william_hooker|William Hooker]] - Legendary avant‑garde drummer who first brought Anthony Pirog and James Brandon Lewis together in one of his groups, helping seed the relationship that led to the later quartet with The Messthetics. (Early ensemble work prior to Lewis’s albums “No Filter” and “An UnRuly Manifesto,” where Pirog later appeared.) [c. mid‑2010s (before 2017)]
- [[matthew_shipp|Matthew Shipp]] - Pianist whose collaborations with punk and experimental figures (including Henry Rollins) helped introduce Lewis to a world where avant‑garde jazz and punk aesthetics intersect, shaping the conceptual ground for his work with The Messthetics. (Not tied to a specific Messthetics project, but Shipp’s example influenced Lewis’s approach during the period leading to “No Filter,” “An UnRuly Manifesto,” and ultimately the 2024 collaboration.) [From around 2011 onward[2]]

- [[impulse_records|Impulse! Records]] - Historic jazz label that released the quartet’s self‑titled 2024 album, providing a platform that connects their work to a lineage of classic and experimental jazz recordings. (The Messthetics and James Brandon Lewis (2024).) [2024–present[1][3][5]]

### Artists Influenced
- [[younger_experimental_jazz_and_punkadjacent_improvisers_collective_category|Younger experimental jazz and punk‑adjacent improvisers (collective category)]] - Critics and interviews frame the project as a contemporary model for integrating post‑punk energy with free improvisation and jazz tradition, likely impacting emerging bands exploring similar cross‑genre territory, though specific protégés are not yet documented.
