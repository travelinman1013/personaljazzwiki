## Biography
Louis Armstrong and The Mills Brothers represent a landmark collaboration in American jazz and popular music, blending Armstrong’s virtuosic trumpet and charismatic vocals with the Mills Brothers’ innovative vocal harmonies. Armstrong, born in New Orleans in 1901, rose from poverty to become one of the most influential figures in jazz, known for his groundbreaking trumpet technique and distinctive gravelly voice. The Mills Brothers, originally from Piqua, Ohio, began as 'Four Boys and a Guitar' and became famous for their ability to mimic brass instruments with their voices, a technique that set them apart in the vocal group tradition.

Their partnership began in April 1937, when Armstrong, already signed to Decca Records, was paired with the Mills Brothers for a series of studio recordings and radio broadcasts. The combination of Armstrong’s relaxed swing and the Mills Brothers’ hornlike vocal effects proved natural and captivating, resulting in memorable renditions of songs such as 'Carry Me Back to Old Virginny' and 'Darling Nelly Gray.' These sessions not only showcased their musical synergy but also broke new ground for African-American artists in mainstream media, with Armstrong soon becoming the first African-American to host a nationally sponsored radio show and the Mills Brothers being the first African-American vocal group to host a network radio show.

Musically, their style fused big band swing, adult standards, and jazz, with Armstrong’s improvisational flair complementing the Mills Brothers’ tight harmonies and rhythmic innovations. Their collaborations influenced generations of musicians and helped popularize jazz and vocal harmony groups among wider audiences, leaving a lasting legacy in American music history.
