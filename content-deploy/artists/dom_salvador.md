## Biography
Dom Salvador, born Salvador da Silva Filho in 1938 in Rio Claro, São Paulo state, Brazil, is a pioneering Brazilian pianist, composer, and arranger whose work helped define samba‑jazz, samba‑soul, and Brazilian funk within modern Brazilian music.[1][2][5] He began playing drums at age six and switched to piano at nine, studying with local teachers in Rio Claro and turning professional astonishingly early, at age twelve, in Orquestra Excelsior from Mário Plurim.[2][3] After conservatory studies in Campinas, he moved to São Paulo in 1961, immersing himself in the city’s jazz nightlife, first in dance bands and nightclubs and then in more advanced jazz settings.[2][3][4] This period led to his recruitment by drummer Dom Um Romão into the Copa Trio and a move to Rio de Janeiro, where he became a central figure in the legendary Beco das Garrafas scene and accompanied rising stars of bossa nova and MPB such as Elis Regina, Quarteto em Cy, and Jorge Ben, even recording Regina’s debut album “Samba, Eu Canto Assim.”[2][4][5]

Through the 1960s and early 1970s, Salvador’s career expanded in several directions: he led the influential Rio 65 Trio (with Edison Machado and Sérgio Barrozo), became in‑house pianist for the Odeon label from about 1966 to 1973, and played on hundreds of sessions by major Brazilian artists including Elza Soares, Sylvia Telles, Pixinguinha, Edu Lobo, and Roberto Carlos.[1][2][5] At the same time, he founded the all‑Black band Abolição, whose blend of samba, soul, funk, and jazz made him a pioneer of Brazilian soul and samba funk and associated him with the broader Black Rio/Black Soul movement, even as he personally downplayed overt political intent.[1][3][6] In 1976 he moved to New York, recorded his lone American jazz album “My Family” for Muse Records, and soon after took up a long‑running residency as pianist at the River Café in Brooklyn, a post he has held since 1977 while continuing to release albums such as “The Art of Samba Jazz” and perform with his Samba Jazz Sextet.[1][4][5][8]

Musically, Dom Salvador is known for his sophisticated yet earthy synthesis of samba rhythm, American jazz harmony and phrasing, and the grooves of soul and funk, creating a style often labeled samba‑jazz or samba‑soul.[2][3][6] Critics and historians credit him as an architect of Brazilian soul and as an artist who broadened understandings of Black identity and cultural power in Brazil through his music and lyrics.[1][3][6] His pianism combines hard‑swinging right‑hand lines, propulsive left‑hand rhythmic figures, and arrangements that give a jazz sensibility to Brazilian song forms, influencing later generations of Brazilian jazz, funk, and MPB musicians both in Brazil and in the diaspora.[2][4][6] Though he has spent decades based in New York, his legacy remains deeply tied to the evolution of Brazilian jazz and to the cross‑pollination between Brazilian and American Black musical traditions.[1][4][5][6]
