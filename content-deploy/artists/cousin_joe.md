## Biography
Pleasant Joseph, known professionally as Cousin Joe, was born on December 20, 1907, in Wallace, Louisiana, about 30 miles from New Orleans. Raised in a Baptist household, he began singing in church at a young age, but his musical path soon led him to the vibrant jazz and blues scene of New Orleans after his family moved there when he was 12. Immersed in the city's musical culture, Cousin Joe learned guitar and ukulele, later mastering piano, and started performing at local parties, fish fries, and on the bustling riverboats of the 1930s. 

By the early 1940s, Cousin Joe's career took him north to St. Louis, where he joined the band of legendary clarinetist Sidney Bechet. This collaboration marked the beginning of his most prolific recording period, especially after moving to New York in 1942. There, he worked with jazz greats such as Billie Holiday, Charlie Parker, and Mezz Mezzrow, and recorded under various names including Smiling Joe and Brother Joshua. His 1940s recordings, particularly the King Jazz sessions with Bechet and Mezzrow, are considered classics of the New Orleans blues and jazz tradition. 

Cousin Joe continued to perform and record throughout his life, touring Europe in the 1970s and releasing albums like 'Gospel-Wailing, Jazz-Playing, Rock'n'Rolling, Soul-Shouting, Tap-Dancing Bluesman From New Orleans.' Known for his witty lyrics, soulful voice, and genre-blending style, Cousin Joe left a lasting legacy as a pioneering figure in blues and jazz. He passed away in New Orleans on October 2, 1989, remembered for his humor, wisdom, and deep influence on American music.
