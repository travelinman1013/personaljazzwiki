## Biography
Chris Whitley (August 31, 1960 – November 20, 2005) was an American singer-songwriter and guitarist renowned for his innovative blend of blues, rock, Americana, and alternative country. Born in Houston, Texas, Whitley was raised in a creative family—his father worked as an art director and his mother was a sculptor and painter. His early years were marked by frequent moves across the United States and Mexico, exposing him to a wide range of musical influences, from the blues of Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf to the rock of Jimi Hendrix and Creedence Clearwater Revival. By age fifteen, Whitley had taught himself guitar and began performing in local bands, eventually busking on the streets of New York City in the late 1970s.

Whitley's career took a significant turn when he moved to Belgium in 1981, where he formed the band A Noh Rodeo and collaborated with European musicians. Returning to New York in 1988, he was introduced to producer Daniel Lanois, who helped secure Whitley's first major record deal. His 1991 debut album, 'Living with the Law,' received critical acclaim and produced two Billboard Mainstream Rock chart hits. Over the next decade, Whitley released a series of albums that showcased his restless creativity, ranging from the raw acoustic sound of 'Dirt Floor' to the experimental rock of 'Rocket House.' He was celebrated for his evocative lyrics, masterful slide guitar work—often on his signature National Triolian resonator—and his refusal to be confined by genre boundaries.

Despite never achieving mainstream stardom, Whitley influenced a generation of musicians with his distinctive style and uncompromising artistry. He continued to record and perform prolifically until his untimely death from lung cancer in 2005 at age 45. His legacy endures through a diverse discography and a reputation as a nonconformist who expanded the possibilities of roots-based music.
