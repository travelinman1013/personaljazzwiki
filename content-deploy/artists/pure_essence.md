## Biography
Pure Essence were an American R&B and funk band from Cincinnati, Ohio, active primarily between 1973 and 1982.[1] The group emerged when guitarist/vocalist Steve “Tuck” Walters and vocalist/percussionist Jerome “Mouse” Richmond joined the local band Mother’s Pride in the early–mid 1970s and helped steer it toward a new sound and identity, eventually adopting the name Pure Essence.[1] Drawing on the rich musical culture of Cincinnati and the broader 1970s soul and funk movements, they blended elements of funk, R&B, soul, and rock into a modern-sounding style that stood out among regional peers.[1]

Although Pure Essence released only one official single in their original run—the 1976 45 “Wake Up (Parts 1 & 2)” backed with “Third Rock” on Mantra Records—the band built a local following and secured radio play, including airplay for “Wake Up” on WCIN and for “Third Rock” via WEBN’s Album Project, where it became a local hit.[1] Former Pittsburgh Pirates baseball star Dave Parker partially financed the group, enabling studio sessions that captured their sophisticated arrangements and socially attuned lyrics.[1] By 1980, after personnel changes and a move by some members to Indianapolis, they shortened their name to Essence and worked the club circuit intensely before eventually disbanding; drummer Antonio “L.A.” Reid and bassist Kevin “Kayo” Roberson went on to form The Deele with guitarist Kenneth “Babyface” Edmonds in 1983, a connection that ties Pure Essence directly to the later rise of LaFace Records and contemporary R&B.[1]

Musically, Pure Essence were known for tightly arranged grooves, strong vocal harmonies, and a fusion of deep funk rhythms with rock-influenced instrumentation and soulful, sometimes psychedelic overtones.[1] Their recordings, though limited in quantity, were rediscovered decades later by collectors and reissue labels: “Wake Up/Third Rock” was re-released by Soul Cal Records in 2005, and the band’s work has appeared on compilations such as *WEBN – The Album Project #2*, Stones Throw’s *Chrome Children*, and *Soul Cal: Funky Disco & Modern Soul 1971–82*, helping solidify their reputation as a cult favorite among modern soul and rare-groove aficionados.[1] This late appreciation has given Pure Essence an enduring legacy far beyond their modest commercial impact at the time, positioning them as an influential deep-cut reference point in the history of Midwestern funk and soul.

## Fun Facts
- Pure Essence’s early studio recordings were partially financed by Pittsburgh Pirates star outfielder Dave Parker, an unusual example of a Major League Baseball player directly backing a regional funk band.[1]
- Their song “Third Rock” began as a contribution to WEBN’s *Album Project* and was popular enough to be added to the station’s regular playlist, giving the band a significant local radio boost despite having only one officially released single.[1]
- By around 1980, the group had shortened its name to “Essence” and was playing as many as four shows a night, six nights a week on the Indianapolis club circuit, reflecting a grueling work schedule for a largely regional act.[1]
- Decades after their initial run, Pure Essence’s lone 1976 single was reissued by Soul Cal in 2005 and later featured on influential compilations, turning what had been a local rarity into a prized discovery for international soul and funk collectors.[1]

Reid and Kevin "Kayo" Roberson formed The Deele with Kenneth "Babyface" Edmonds; Pure Essence thus forms part of the early musical path of executives and artists who would later shape mainstream R&B and pop. (The Deele’s formation in 1983 and subsequent work eventually led Reid and Babyface to co-found LaFace Records, home to major R&B and pop acts.[1]) [Post-1982; The Deele formed in 1983, with broader influence extending into the late 1980s and 1990s through LaFace.[1]]
- [[modern_soul_rare_groove_and_crate-digging_djscollectors|Modern soul, rare groove, and crate-digging DJs/collectors]] - The 2005 reissue of “Wake Up/Third Rock” and inclusion of Pure Essence tracks on later compilations brought the band into the orbit of DJs and producers seeking deep funk and soul cuts, influencing setlists and sample choices in underground scenes. (Appearances on *Chrome Children* (a Stones Throw hip-hop compilation) and *Soul Cal: Funky Disco & Modern Soul 1971–82* helped reintroduce their sound to new generations.[1]) [From mid-2000s reissues onward.[1]]
