## Biography
Georgia White was an American blues singer known for her sly, often risqué urban blues recordings in the 1930s and 1940s.[1][3][4] Born on March 9, 1903, in Sandersville, Georgia, she was of African American heritage and migrated north, becoming part of Chicago’s vibrant club scene by the late 1920s.[1][2] Little is documented about her childhood, but by the time she surfaced on record she was already a polished professional singer with a confident, conversational vocal style that fit the emerging cabaret- and nightclub-oriented blues of the era.[1][4] 

White began recording in the mid-1930s and quickly became one of the more prolific female blues singers of her time, cutting dozens of sides for labels such as Decca that showcased her humorous, double‑entendre lyrics and relaxed yet assertive delivery.[2][3][4] Her repertoire blended blues with elements of vaudeville and popular song, and many of her records featured small jazz/blues combos that gave her work a sophisticated, urban edge.[3][4] Although her last known recordings date from the 1940s, she continued performing into the 1940s in Chicago clubs before fading from the public eye; she is believed to have died around 1980.[2][3][4] 

Today, White is remembered as part of the lineage of classic and urban blues women whose records helped bridge the gap between the classic blues divas of the 1920s and postwar rhythm and blues.[3][4] Collectors and historians have revived interest in her catalog, noting both her candid approach to sexuality and her role in documenting the everyday lives and humor of Black urban communities in the interwar years.[3][4] Though not as widely known as some contemporaries, her body of work remains a valued reference point for scholars and enthusiasts of prewar Chicago blues and women’s blues singing.[3][4]

## Fun Facts
- Georgia White often recorded mildly risqué blues songs, using humor and double entendre to address adult themes that were daring for commercial records of the 1930s.[2][3]
