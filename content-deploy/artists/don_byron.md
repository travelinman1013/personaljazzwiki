## Biography
Don Byron is a Grammy-nominated clarinetist, saxophonist, composer, arranger, and social critic, celebrated for his genre-defying approach and technical virtuosity. Born and raised in the Bronx, New York City, Byron was immersed in music from an early age, influenced by his father, who played bass in calypso bands, and his mother, a pianist. As a child with asthma, Byron was advised to take up a wind instrument for therapeutic reasons and chose the clarinet, which would become his signature voice. His upbringing in a diverse South Bronx neighborhood, which included a significant Jewish population, sparked his early fascination with klezmer music, a genre he would later reinterpret and popularize as an African American artist.

Byron formalized his music education by studying classical clarinet with Joe Allard and later attended the New England Conservatory of Music, where he studied under George Russell in the Third Stream Department. While in Boston, he performed with Latin and jazz ensembles and joined Hankus Netsky’s Klezmer Conservatory Band. Returning to New York in the mid-1980s, Byron became an active participant in the city’s avant-garde jazz scene, collaborating with figures such as David Murray and Hamiet Bluiett. His discography is marked by conceptual albums that explore a wide range of traditions, from the free jazz/classical fusion of 'Tuskegee Experiments' to the funk and hip-hop influences of 'Nu Blaxploitation.' Byron’s work consistently seeks what he calls 'a sound above genre,' and he has composed for string quartets, silent film, and television, as well as serving as director of jazz for the Brooklyn Academy of Music.

Byron’s legacy is that of a restless innovator who has expanded the clarinet’s role in contemporary music and challenged genre boundaries. He has been recognized as Jazz Artist of the Year by Down Beat magazine and has received multiple international accolades for his creativity and technical mastery. His influence extends through his teaching, compositions, and the inspiration he provides to musicians seeking to transcend musical categories.
