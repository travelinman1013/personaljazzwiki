## Biography
Theodore Roosevelt "Hound Dog" Taylor was born on April 12, 1915, in Mississippi and became one of Chicago's most influential blues musicians, though he remained largely unknown outside the city until his early 50s.[1][3] Taylor didn't begin playing guitar until age 20, working as a sharecropper by day while performing at Delta juke joints and house parties in the evenings.[1] After a traumatic encounter with the Ku Klux Klan in 1942, when a cross was burned in his yard, Taylor relocated to Chicago, where he performed on the famous Maxwell Street outdoor market, competing for tips alongside blues legends Muddy Waters and Robert Nighthawk.[1] Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, he worked factory jobs by day while playing Chicago's South Side bars at night, recording several singles for local labels that gained minimal traction outside the city.[2]

Taylor's career transformed dramatically in 1969 when Bruce Iglauer, a young blues enthusiast working as a shipping clerk at Delmark Records, discovered him performing at Eddie Shaw's club.[2] After failing to convince his employer to sign Taylor, Iglauer used a $2,500 inheritance to establish Alligator Records in 1971 specifically to record Taylor's music.[1][3] The debut album *Hound Dog Taylor and the HouseRockers*, recorded in just two nights at Sound Studios in Chicago, became Alligator's first release and launched Taylor to national prominence.[3][4] With his band—guitarist Brewer Phillips and drummer Ted Harvey—Taylor created a raw, hypnotic sound that critic Robert Christgau famously called "the Ramones of the blues."[1] Taylor's electrified, feral style, characterized by fast, loud, and deliberately sloppy playing, stood in stark contrast to the polished blues of his era, yet it conveyed profound emotional power and infectious joy.[1]

From 1971 until his death on December 17, 1975, Taylor toured extensively across the United States and internationally, winning devoted audiences particularly among college students and younger listeners.[1][3] His subsequent albums *Natural Boogie* (1973) and the live recording *Beware of the Dog* (1974, released posthumously) received Grammy nominations and critical acclaim.[1] Taylor's uncompromising artistic vision—whether performing at Chicago's Florence's Lounge or at prestigious universities like Yale and Harvard—never wavered, and his influence on rock and blues musicians proved enduring despite his brief time in the spotlight.[1][3] His legacy was instrumental in establishing Alligator Records as a major blues label, and his pioneering fusion of blues and rock energy continues to inspire musicians decades after his death.

## Fun Facts
- Hound Dog Taylor was born with six fingers on each hand due to polydactylism. He later cut off the extra finger on his right hand with a straight razor during a drunken incident.[2]
- Taylor was named Theodore Roosevelt Taylor after the U.S. President, and the nickname "Hound Dog" stuck from his early performing days.[2]
- Bruce Iglauer founded Alligator Records with a $2,500 inheritance specifically to record Hound Dog Taylor after being rejected by his employer at Delmark Records, making Taylor's debut album the very first release on the label.[2][3]
- Robert Christgau, the influential Village Voice music critic, famously referred to Hound Dog Taylor and the HouseRockers as "the Ramones of the blues" due to their raw, fast, and deliberately imperfect playing style.[1]
