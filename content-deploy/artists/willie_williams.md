## Biography
Willie Williams, born on November 1, 1958, in Wilmington, North Carolina, moved to Philadelphia with his family at six months old. Raised in the tradition of Philadelphia saxophonists, he began performing and recording professionally with local acts by age 12, quickly becoming a highly regarded young talent. Graduating as the top student in his high school class, he studied classical saxophone with Marshall Taylor at the Philadelphia College of the Performing Arts, balancing diverse ensembles by day and pursuing his passion for jazz by night with organ trios like those led by Don Patterson, Groove Holmes, and Charlie Earland.[1]

After leading his own quartet in Philadelphia and opening for Bobby Watson, Williams relocated to New York City, where he performed with jazz luminaries including Art Blakey, Jackie Byard, Sam Rivers, and Arthur Taylor's Wailers quintet. He toured with Clifford Jordan's Big Band, Mingus Dynasty ensembles, and maintained a long collaboration with T.S. Monk, later serving as musical director for Papo Vazquez's Mighty Pirate Orchestra. His style blends hard bop and post-bop influences from Philadelphia's jazz scene, marked by virtuosic saxophone work, composition, and arrangement.[1]

Williams has recorded five critically acclaimed albums as a leader, including Willie Williams Father And Son (WWM002), Comet Ride (Miles High Records), and WW 3 (Enja Records), and contributed to projects like Cedar Walton's Roots and the Verve 50th Anniversary Concert. An award-winning performer, composer, arranger, and educator, he has taught since 1974 at institutions like Settlement Music School, Jazz Mobile, and Harlem School of the Arts, earning accolades such as 'Best Soloist' at Quinnipiac College and 'Outstanding Soloist' at the Washington Jazz Festival.[1]
