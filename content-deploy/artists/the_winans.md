## Biography
The Winans are a pioneering American gospel quartet from Detroit, Michigan, formed by brothers Ronald, Marvin, Carvin, and Michael Winans, the second through fifth children in the large Winans musical family.[4][1] Raised in a strict but loving Christian home by David “Pop” and Delores “Mom” Winans, both active church singers and musicians, the brothers grew up singing in the Zion Congregational Church of God in Christ and local gospel choirs.[1][2] In the early 1970s they performed as the Testimonial Singers, cutting two albums in 1974 before adding Michael and adopting the name The Winans in 1975.[1][4] Their big break came when contemporary gospel trailblazer Andraé Crouch discovered them and signed the group to Light Records, leading to their debut album *Introducing The Winans* (1981), which featured early classics like “The Question Is” and “Restoration.”[2][3]

Through the 1980s and early 1990s, The Winans became one of the most influential forces in contemporary gospel, updating the traditional male quartet sound with polished vocal harmonies, urban contemporary R&B production, and deeply church-rooted lyrics.[2][3] Albums such as *Long Time Comin’* (1983), *Tomorrow* (1984), *Let My People Go* (1985–86), and *Decision* (1987) broke ground on the gospel charts and won multiple Grammy Awards, including Best Soul Gospel Performance for “Tomorrow,” “Let My People Go,” and the crossover duet “Ain’t No Need to Worry” with Anita Baker, as well as a Grammy for the live project *The Winans Live at Carnegie Hall*.[1][2] Their move to Quincy Jones’s Qwest label brought broader mainstream exposure and collaborations with R&B figures like Vanessa Bell Armstrong and Michael McDonald, while later projects such as *Return* (1990), *All Out* (early 1990s), *Heart & Soul* (1995), and the reunion holiday album *Christmas: Our Gifts to You* (2000) solidified them as elder statesmen of modern gospel.[2][3]

Musically, The Winans fused the emotional intensity and tight harmonies of classic quartet and choir gospel with smooth, synthesizer‑driven R&B grooves that matched the urban sound of their era, helping define what would become known as contemporary and urban gospel.[2][5] Their success opened doors for a wide network of Winans family spin‑off acts—among them BeBe & CeCe Winans, Daniel Winans, Angie & Debbie, and third‑generation group Winans Phase 2—creating a multi‑generational gospel dynasty.[2][3] Even as individual members pursued pastoral work, solo careers, and other ministries, the group’s catalog and sound have remained a reference point for later gospel and inspirational R&B artists, and their induction into institutions such as the Gospel Music Hall of Fame reflects their lasting legacy as R&B‑gospel pioneers.[3][5]

## Fun Facts
- The brothers originally sang under the name **The Testimonial Singers**, recording two albums in 1974 before adopting the name The Winans in 1975.[1][4]
- Their father David “Pop” Winans sang in a quartet modeled on classic groups like the Dixie Hummingbirds and the Mighty Clouds of Joy, and he was friends with Sam Cooke before Cooke became a soul star.[1]
- The Winans’ live album *The Winans Live at Carnegie Hall* not only highlighted their concert power but also earned them a Grammy, a rare achievement for a gospel quartet performing in that storied venue.[1][2]
- Despite strong major‑label offers—Michael Winans recalled that “MCA offered us the world” —the group chose Quincy Jones’s smaller Qwest imprint so they would not get lost on a huge roster, while still refusing to compromise their gospel message.[5]
