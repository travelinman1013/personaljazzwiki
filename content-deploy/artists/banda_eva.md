## Biography
Banda Eva is a prominent Brazilian axé music group originating from Salvador, Bahia. The group traces its roots to 1977, when it began as a student association before evolving into a carnival bloco (parade group) in 1980, parading through the streets of Salvador during Carnival. Over the years, the bloco was led by several respected artists, including Aderson Cirne, Jota Morbeck, Carlinhos Caldas, Luiz Caldas, Marcionílio, Ricardo Chaves, and Durval Lélys, contributing to its reputation as a breeding ground for musical talent.

In 1993, the project was transformed into a formal band, debuting with Ivete Sangalo as its lead vocalist. Under Sangalo's leadership, Banda Eva achieved national fame, especially with the 1996 album 'Beleza Rara' and the live album 'Banda Eva Ao Vivo,' which sold two million copies and established the group as a leading force in axé music. The band became synonymous with Carnival celebrations and hits like "Eva," "Me Abraça," and "Beleza Rara." After Sangalo's departure in 1999 to pursue a solo career, the band continued with new vocalists, including Emanuelle Araújo, Saulo Fernandes, and later Felipe Pezzoni, each bringing their own style and helping the band maintain its relevance.

Banda Eva is recognized for its energetic blend of axé, pagode baiano, and other Bahian rhythms, and for its role in launching the careers of major Brazilian artists. With over 8 million albums sold, the group remains a symbol of Salvador's Carnival and a key contributor to the evolution of contemporary Brazilian popular music.
