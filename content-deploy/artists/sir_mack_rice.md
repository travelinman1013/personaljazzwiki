## Biography
Sir Mack Rice, born Bonny Rice on November 10, 1933, in Clarksdale, Mississippi, was a pivotal figure in classic soul and R&B. Moving to Detroit at age 17, Rice began his musical journey in the vibrant Detroit scene, first performing with the Five Scalders before joining the Falcons in 1957. The Falcons, featuring future stars like Wilson Pickett, Eddie Floyd, and Joe Stubbs, became a launching pad for Rice's career, allowing him to hone his vocal and songwriting talents within the burgeoning soul movement.

Rice's greatest impact came as a songwriter, penning enduring hits such as "Mustang Sally"—originally a solo hit for himself but immortalized by Wilson Pickett—and "Respect Yourself," co-written with Luther Ingram for the Staple Singers. He worked extensively with Stax and Motown, bridging the Memphis and Detroit soul sounds. Though he had modest chart success as a solo artist, Rice's compositions became staples of the genre, recorded by artists including Etta James, Albert King, and Johnnie Taylor. His legacy is that of a behind-the-scenes architect of soul, whose songs remain influential and widely covered.

Rice continued to write, produce, and perform into the later decades of his life, releasing solo albums and contributing to the catalogs of numerous artists. He passed away in Detroit on June 27, 2016, remembered as a foundational songwriter whose work defined an era of American music.
