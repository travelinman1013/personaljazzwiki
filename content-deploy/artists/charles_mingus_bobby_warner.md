## Biography
Charles Mingus Jr. (April 22, 1922 – January 5, 1979) was a towering figure in twentieth-century American music, renowned as a virtuoso jazz double bassist, composer, pianist, bandleader, and author. Born in Nogales, Arizona, and raised in Watts, Los Angeles, Mingus was exposed early to church music and the sounds of Duke Ellington, which profoundly shaped his musical sensibility. He began his formal music education studying cello and later double bass, receiving instruction from H. Rheinshagen of the New York Philharmonic and learning composition from Lloyd Reese. By his teens and twenties, Mingus was already touring with jazz luminaries such as Louis Armstrong and Lionel Hampton, and he quickly established himself as a formidable presence in the jazz world.

Mingus's career flourished in New York City, where he became a central figure in the bebop and post-bop movements, collaborating with legends like Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, Bud Powell, Art Tatum, and Duke Ellington. His innovative approach blended gospel, classical, and folk influences, and he was a pioneer of collective improvisation, a precursor to free jazz. In the 1950s, he founded the Jazz Workshop, nurturing young talent and experimenting with new compositional forms. Seminal albums such as 'Pithecanthropus Erectus' (1956), 'Mingus Ah Um' (1959), and 'The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady' (1963) redefined the boundaries of jazz, combining emotional intensity with sophisticated structure.

Despite facing racial discrimination and personal struggles, Mingus's legacy endures through his prolific output, his autobiography 'Beneath the Underdog,' and the ongoing work of repertory ensembles like the Mingus Big Band. His music remains a touchstone for jazz musicians and composers, celebrated for its complexity, passion, and social consciousness.
