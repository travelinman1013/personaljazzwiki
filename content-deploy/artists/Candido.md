## Biography
Candido Camero, born Cándido de Guerra Camero on April 22, 1921, in the El Cerro barrio of San Antonio de los Baños, Havana, Cuba, was a pioneering percussionist whose career spanned over eight decades and left an indelible mark on Afro-Cuban jazz and Latin music[1][3][4]. As a child, he initially played the string bass before moving to the tres guitar, bongos, and eventually the conga drums, which became his signature instrument[1][2]. By his early teens, he was performing with local groups such as Septeto Gloria Habanera and later the house band at Havana’s legendary Tropicana nightclub, establishing himself as a leading figure in Cuba’s vibrant music scene[1][2]. In 1952, encouraged by Dizzy Gillespie, Candido moved to New York, where he became a central figure in both the mambo and bebop movements, bridging Latin rhythms with American jazz[1][3].

Candido’s innovative use of multiple congas and his virtuosic technique made him one of the most sought-after percussionists in jazz and pop music from the 1950s through the 1970s[1][4]. He recorded with a staggering array of jazz legends—including Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, Stan Getz, and Duke Ellington—and became a fixture on American television, appearing on shows like Ed Sullivan and Jackie Gleason[1][3]. His solo career flourished with hits such as “Thousand Finger Man” and “Dancin’ and Prancin’,” and he continued to record and perform well into his 90s, earning a Grammy nomination for Inolvidable in 2004 and the NEA Jazz Masters Fellowship in 2008[3][4]. Candido passed away in New York City on November 7, 2020, at age 99, leaving behind a legacy as one of the most influential conga players in history[3][4].
