## Biography
GoGo Penguin is a British jazz trio formed in Manchester, England, in 2012. The group originally consisted of pianist Chris Illingworth, bassist Nick Blacka, and drummer Rob Turner, with Jon Scott joining as drummer in 2021 after Rob Turner's departure. Their sound is characterized by a fusion of jazz, classical, and electronic influences, blending break-beat rhythms, minimalist piano melodies, and powerful basslines to create an acoustic-electronica hybrid that is both innovative and emotionally resonant[1][2][4].

The band quickly gained recognition for their exhilarating live performances and unique musical style, drawing inspiration from artists such as Aphex Twin, Massive Attack, Brian Eno, Debussy, Shostakovich, and the Esbjörn Svensson Trio (EST)[1][4]. Their debut album, 'Fanfares,' received critical acclaim and was nominated for Best Jazz Album at the World Wide Awards. Subsequent albums, including 'v2.0,' 'Man Made Object,' and 'A Humdrum Star,' further established their reputation, with 'v2.0' earning a Mercury Prize nomination in 2014[4]. GoGo Penguin's ability to synthesize elements from classical, jazz, and electronica has made them a standout act in the contemporary jazz scene.

Throughout their career, GoGo Penguin has toured internationally, performing at major festivals such as Coachella, Fuji Rock, and the Montreal Jazz Festival, and selling out iconic venues like the Royal Albert Hall[2]. Their legacy lies in their innovative approach to jazz, pushing the boundaries of genre and instrumentation, and inspiring a new generation of musicians to explore the intersection of acoustic and electronic music[4][2].
