## Biography
Théophile Do Rego, better known as **El Rego**, was a pioneering Beninese singer, bassist, bandleader, and composer whose raw funk and soul recordings helped define the sound of modern West African popular music in the 1960s and 1970s.[2][3][6] Born on May 3 in Porto-Novo, in what was then Dahomey (now Benin), sources variously give his birth year as 1936 or 1938, but El Rego himself stated 1938 in a later autobiographical note.[2][4][6] Growing up in a port city that was a crossroads for French, Latin American, and pan‑African influences, he was exposed early to highlife, Congolese rumba, French chanson, Cuban music, and American rhythm and blues, all of which would later inform his hybrid style.[2][5][6]

El Rego began his professional career in the 1950s, first working in theater and cabaret before leading orchestras on the regional circuit and eventually forming his own band, **El Rego et ses Commandos**, around the mid‑1960s.[2][5][6] With the Commandos he developed a fiery mix of Beninese rhythms, funk bass lines, gritty horns, and call‑and‑response vocals that paralleled Nigerian Afrobeat and Ghanaian highlife but retained a distinctly Porto‑Novo identity.[2][5] His singles from the late 1960s through the mid‑1970s—originally released on small local labels—became staples of Benin’s dance halls, and his work is cited as an early inspiration for major Beninese groups such as **Orchestre Poly‑Rythmo de Cotonou**.[5] Although he remained largely unknown outside West Africa during his peak years, a 2011 international compilation of his work on the Daptone label brought belated global recognition and cemented his legacy as one of Benin’s foundational funk and soul innovators.[5][6]

Stylistically, El Rego’s music sits at the crossroads of **Afro‑funk, soul, and traditional Beninese rhythms**, with grooves built from churning bass, tight horn riffs, and raw, impassioned vocals that often switch between French and local languages.[2][3][5][6] His arrangements drew on the structural ideas of American R&B and James Brown–era funk while integrating percussion patterns rooted in Vodun‑related and regional dance rhythms, giving his songs a polyrhythmic density typical of Beninese music.[5][6] By fusing these elements and leading one of the country’s most respected bands from the 1960s into the 1980s, he helped shape the sonic template for later Beninese and broader West African funk artists, and his recordings have since been widely reissued, sampled, and championed by collectors and DJs worldwide.[3][5][6]

## Fun Facts
- El Rego signed an autobiographical note introducing himself to international listeners—used in later reissue liner notes—in which he personally states, "I was born May 3rd, 1938 in Porto Novo, Dahomey," clarifying conflicting external reports that list 1936 or different birthplaces.[4][6]
- Although often grouped with Afrobeat and Afro‑funk, El Rego’s music is rooted specifically in Beninese traditions, making him one of the earliest documented artists to translate Porto‑Novo’s local rhythms into a modern electric band format.[2][5][6]
- For decades his records were known mainly to local audiences and deep vinyl collectors; widespread international awareness of his work only arrived after a Daptone Records compilation of his singles was released in 2011.[5][6]
- He worked across multiple entertainment fields—including theater and cabaret—before becoming best known as a bandleader and recording artist, a background that contributed to the strong showmanship of his live performances.[5][6]

## Musical Connections

### Mentors/Influences
- [[american_randb_and_soul_artists_e.g._james_brownera_funk|American R&B and soul artists (e.g., James Brown–era funk)]] - Stylistic influences; his arrangements and grooves drew heavily on the structures and rhythmic drive of American R&B and funk while being localized with Beninese rhythms. (General influence across his 1960s–1970s singles later compiled on the Daptone "El Rego" anthology.) [1960s–1970s]

### Key Collaborators
- [[el_rego_et_ses_commandos|El Rego et ses Commandos]] - His primary band as singer, bassist, leader, and composer, with whom he recorded his classic funk and soul sides and led performances across Benin and the region. (Numerous 45 rpm singles from the 1960s–1970s later collected on the Daptone "El Rego" compilation.) [Mid‑1960s – at least late 1970s]

### Artists Influenced
- [[orchestre_polyrythmo_de_cotonou|Orchestre Poly‑Rythmo de Cotonou]] - A major Beninese band for whom El Rego is explicitly cited as an early inspiration, helping shape their approach to fusing local rhythms with funk and soul. (Influence is general and historical rather than tied to a single track; noted in critical writing discussing Benin’s funk scene.) [Late 1960s–1970s (Poly‑Rythmo’s formative and classic years)]
