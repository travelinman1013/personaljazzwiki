## Biography
Liz McComb, born in 1952 in Cleveland, Ohio, is a celebrated gospel singer, pianist, and composer whose artistry bridges the worlds of African-American spiritual music and European concert stages. Raised as the sixth of seven children in a deeply religious family originally from Mississippi, McComb was immersed in the Pentecostal church from an early age—her mother was a preacher and pastor, and her sisters formed a gospel group, The Daughters of Zion, which Liz joined as a child. Her early musical influences included gospel legends like Mahalia Jackson, Sister Rosetta Tharpe, and the Staple Singers, as well as jazz icons such as Louis Armstrong and Nat King Cole, introduced to her by her trumpet-playing brother.[2][3][4][6]

McComb began performing in church at age three and later honed her stagecraft at Cleveland's Karamu House community theater. After a stint in New York aspiring to Broadway, she was recruited to Europe in the early 1980s, first as a member of the Jean Austin Singers and then with the Roots of Rock'n'Roll group, where she opened for gospel great Bessie Griffin. Her dynamic performances quickly earned her acclaim across Switzerland, Germany, and France, leading to collaborations with luminaries such as Ray Charles, James Brown, and Taj Mahal. Settling in Paris, McComb became known for her powerful, improvisational vocal style and her ability to blend gospel, blues, jazz, and classical traditions. Her album 'Time is Now' won the Mahalia Jackson Prize, and she has performed at prestigious venues including the Olympia in Paris, often using her platform for social causes such as free concerts for the homeless.[1][2][3]

McComb's legacy lies in her commitment to honoring and evolving the spiritual and musical heritage of her ancestors. She has worked to unite the oral traditions of gospel and blues with the written traditions of classical music, performing symphonic concerts in France and continually seeking new musical challenges. Her artistry is celebrated for its emotional depth, technical mastery, and its role in bringing African-American gospel to global audiences.[2][3][1]
