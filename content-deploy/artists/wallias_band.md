## Biography
Walias Band (often spelled Wallias Band) is an Ethiopian jazz and funk ensemble that emerged from Addis Ababa’s vibrant hotel and club circuit in the early 1970s, becoming one of the most innovative groups of the Ethio‑jazz era.[3][2] Formed by members of the Venus Band, the group developed a distinct hard, polyrhythmic funk sound that blended traditional Ethiopian pentatonic scales with Western jazz, soul, and funk influences, and they quickly became in‑demand accompanists for leading vocalists as well as a formidable instrumental band in their own right.[3][2] Their regular performances at venues such as the Hilton Addis Ababa, Zula, and the Venus Club placed them at the center of Ethiopia’s nightlife during a politically turbulent period.[2][3]

In 1977 Walias Band recorded one of the rare Ethiopian instrumental LPs of the era, the album *Tche Belew*, which is now regarded as a classic of Ethiopian music and a landmark of Ethio‑jazz; the project featured vibraphonist and Ethio‑jazz pioneer Mulatu Astatke and showcased the group’s sophisticated arrangements and deep, groove‑driven style.[3][2] In 1981 they became the first modern Ethiopian band to tour the United States, performing with singer Mahmoud Ahmed primarily for audiences of Ethiopian refugees, and several members—including Hailu Mergia, Girma Bèyènè, Mogès Habté, and Mèlakè Gèbrè—chose to remain in the U.S., where they later formed the Zula Band rather than return to Ethiopia under the Derg dictatorship.[3][4] The remaining core members continued performing under difficult political conditions in Ethiopia into the early 1990s, maintaining the group’s presence on the local scene even as the original lineup fragmented.[3]

From the late 1990s onward, Walias Band’s legacy expanded globally when French label Buda Records reissued much of their work in the influential *Éthiopiques* CD series, bringing tracks such as their instrumental "Musicawi Silt" to international attention.[3] That tune in particular became a popular dance number and has since been covered by numerous artists, helping to cement Walias Band’s reputation as foundational figures in Ethio‑jazz and Ethiopian funk.[3] Today, they are remembered both for their role as a backing band to major Ethiopian stars and for their own pioneering recordings, which encapsulate the creativity and resilience of Ethiopian musicians during a time of intense political upheaval.[3][1]
