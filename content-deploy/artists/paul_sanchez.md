## Biography
Paul Sanchez is a celebrated singer-songwriter and guitarist from New Orleans, Louisiana, whose music fuses the city’s street rhythms, introspective songwriting, and rock ‘n’ roll energy. Born and raised in the Irish Channel neighborhood, Sanchez grew up in a large, working-class family where music was a constant presence, often heard from radios and windows throughout the neighborhood. He began performing at age fifteen in bars around the French Quarter, absorbing the city’s diverse musical traditions.

In the 1980s, Sanchez moved to New York and became part of the Anti-Folk scene in the East Village, honing his songwriting craft. He returned to New Orleans in the early 1990s and co-founded the rock band Cowboy Mouth, with whom he recorded eleven albums and toured extensively across the U.S. and Europe throughout the 1990s and early 2000s. After losing his home to Hurricane Katrina, Sanchez left Cowboy Mouth and focused on rebuilding his life and career in New Orleans, releasing a prolific catalog of solo albums—22 as of 2025. His work also includes composing for musical theater, notably the stage adaptation of 'Nine Lives,' and acting roles in productions such as HBO’s 'Treme.'

Sanchez’s legacy is deeply intertwined with the New Orleans music community. He is recognized for his eclectic blend of roots rock, folk, and local influences, and has received numerous awards, including multiple Best Roots Rock Artist and Album honors and the Allen Toussaint Award. His songs have been recorded by a wide range of artists, cementing his status as a vital figure in contemporary New Orleans music.
