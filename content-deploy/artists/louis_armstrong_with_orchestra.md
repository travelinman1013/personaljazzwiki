## Biography
Louis Armstrong, born August 4, 1901 in New Orleans, Louisiana, rose from a childhood of poverty to become one of the most influential figures in jazz history. His early musical experiences began in brass bands and on riverboats, notably with Fate Marable, where Armstrong learned to read music and developed his skills with written arrangements[1][3][4]. Mentored by Joe 'King' Oliver, Armstrong moved to Chicago in 1922 to join Oliver's Creole Jazz Band, quickly establishing himself as a formidable trumpeter and cornetist. His inventive solos and charismatic stage presence helped shift jazz from a collective improvisational style to one focused on individual artistry[1][5].

Armstrong's career flourished in the 1920s and 1930s, with landmark recordings as leader of the Hot Five and Hot Seven ensembles, introducing innovations such as scat singing and dramatic solo structure[2][3]. He collaborated with top musicians, including pianist Earl Hines and bandleader Fletcher Henderson, and performed with large orchestras and big bands, notably Luis Russell's orchestra. Armstrong's repertoire expanded to popular songs by composers like Hoagy Carmichael and Duke Ellington, and his gravelly voice and expressive trumpet playing became instantly recognizable[2]. By the 1950s, Armstrong was an international icon, appearing in films, radio, and television, and leading the All Stars, a small group that sustained his career into his final decades[1][3].

Armstrong's musical style was marked by technical virtuosity, melodic invention, and a joyful swing that influenced generations of musicians. His legacy endures as a pioneer who transformed jazz into a soloist's art, inspiring countless artists across genres and earning accolades such as Grammy Awards and induction into multiple halls of fame[1][5].
