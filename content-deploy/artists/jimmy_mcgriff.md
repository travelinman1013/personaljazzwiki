## Biography
James Harrell McGriff was born on April 3, 1936, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, a city renowned as the capital of the jazz organ world. He began his musical journey at age five playing piano, later taking up alto saxophone, vibes, drums, and upright bass. After his discharge from the Army in 1956, McGriff became captivated by the Hammond B-3 organ after hearing Richard "Groove" Holmes perform at his sister's wedding. He pursued formal training at the Juilliard School of Music and the Combe College of Music in Philadelphia, while also studying privately with Hammond B-3 masters Jimmy Smith and Richard "Groove" Holmes, both of whom profoundly influenced his musical development.

McGriff's breakthrough came in 1962 when his instrumental soul-jazz rearrangement of Ray Charles' "I've Got a Woman" became a Top 20 pop hit and reached number 5 on the R&B charts on the Sue label, establishing him as a fiery blues-based organist. Throughout the 1960s, he recorded prolifically for Sue Records, achieving further success with singles like "All About My Girl," "Kiko," and "The Worm." He subsequently recorded for Solid State, Blue Note, and other labels, demonstrating remarkable versatility by adapting his style to the fusion movement and later to disco trends while maintaining his core blues-based sound. By the 1970s and beyond, McGriff continued to evolve, eventually settling in Newark, New Jersey, where he opened his own supper club, The Golden Slipper, and recorded numerous acclaimed albums.

McGriff distinguished himself as the bluesiest of all jazz organists, seamlessly blending gospel, soul, and "fatback groove" into his playing. His career spanned decades with renewed popularity in the mid-1990s through collaborations with saxophonist David "Fathead" Newman and drummer Bernard Purdie in 'The Dream Team' group. He passed away on May 24, 2008, in New Jersey, leaving behind a legacy as one of the most popular and prolific jazz and blues organists in history.
