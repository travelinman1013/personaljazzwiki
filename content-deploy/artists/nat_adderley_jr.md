# Nat Adderley Jr

## Biography
Nat Adderley Jr., born on May 23, 1955, in Quincy, Florida, to jazz cornetist Nat Adderley Sr. and Ann James, grew up immersed in music as the nephew of legendary alto saxophonist Cannonball Adderley. He attended Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts in Manhattan, where he performed and wrote music for his father's Cannonball Adderley Quintet. At age 11, he composed and arranged 'I'm On My Way' for Cannonball's 1967 album *Why Am I Treated So Bad!*. Adderley earned a B.A. in African American studies from Yale University in 1977, while early in his career working as a keyboardist for R&B singer Valerie Simpson.[3][6]

Adderley's career flourished in R&B as music director, arranger, composer, and producer for Luther Vandross from 1981 to 2005, contributing hits like 'Stop to Love,' 'Wait for Love,' 'Give Me the Reason' (Grammy-nominated), and arrangements for 'Superstar,' 'So Amazing,' and 'Never Too Much.' He produced Vandross's Grammy-winning albums *Power of Love* (1991), *Dance with My Father*, and the duet 'The Closer I Get to You' with Beyoncé (2003). Beyond Vandross, he arranged Aretha Franklin's *Jump to It* (1983), Natalie Cole's 'When I Fall in Love,' and worked with Kirk Whalum, Gloria Lynne, Doc Powell, Johnny Gill, and the Temptations.[1][2][3][5]

After Vandross's death in 2005, Adderley returned to jazz roots, performing with ensembles featuring Vincent Herring, Regina Carter, Tom Scott, Jay Hoggard, and his trio/quarter with bassist Chris Berger and drummers like Tommy Campbell, Dwayne Cook Broadnax, and Vince Ector. His debut jazz album as leader, *Took So Long* (2025, NAJ label), features standards and his original title track, showcasing improvisational piano influenced by Erroll Garner. He has also served as musical director for theater productions like *Sophisticated Ladies* (2019), *Robeson* (2019), and *Lady Day at Emerson’s Bar and Grill* (2023), earning an Audelco Award nomination.[1][2][4]
