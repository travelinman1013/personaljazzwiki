## Biography
Ain't Misbehavin' is a revue musical celebrating the music of Thomas 'Fats' Waller, featuring 31 songs from his catalog along with contributions from other composers. It premiered on Broadway at the Longacre Theatre on May 9, 1978, directed by Richard Maltby, Jr. and choreographed by Arthur Faria, running for 1,604 performances across multiple venues until February 1982.[1][3] The production showcases five performers portraying characters inspired by Waller's era, delivering jazz standards in a lively, revue-style format without a linear plot, capturing the Harlem Renaissance spirit through songs like 'Honeysuckle Rose,' 'Ain't Misbehavin',' and 'Black and Blue.'[1][5]

The original Broadway cast propelled the show's success, earning multiple Tony Awards including Best Musical Revival and Best Featured Actress for Nell Carter. Subsequent productions and tours featured rotating casts, maintaining the focus on Waller's stride piano style and Harlem jazz influences.[3][6] The musical's style blends high-energy tap, vocals across soprano to baritone ranges, and ensemble numbers that highlight improvisation and rhythm, influencing regional theater revivals worldwide.[1][2]

Its legacy endures through Tony wins, Grammy-nominated cast album, and ongoing productions that preserve Fats Waller's contributions to jazz and American musical theater, inspiring tributes to Harlem's vibrant 1920s-1930s scene.[3][7]
