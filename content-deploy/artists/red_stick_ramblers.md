## Biography
The Red Stick Ramblers were a dynamic Cajun and Western Swing band formed in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in 1999 by a group of Louisiana State University students, including Linzay Young and Joel Savoy[1][2][3]. Their name is a direct translation of Baton Rouge ('red stick' in French), reflecting their deep Louisiana roots and commitment to regional musical traditions. The group quickly gained recognition for their energetic blend of Cajun, Western swing, gypsy jazz, bluegrass, and honky tonk, earning OffBeat Magazine's Best Emerging Cajun Band award in 2002[2].

Throughout their career, the Ramblers developed a reputation for both honoring and innovating traditional music. Their repertoire included classic Cajun songs, Western swing standards, early jazz and blues covers, and original compositions inspired by these genres[1][2][5]. The band's musicianship was lauded for its authenticity and versatility, with members contributing vocals and instrumentals that showcased influences from artists like Bob Wills, Django Reinhardt, Dennis McGee, and Doc Watson[2]. Their albums, notably those released on Sugar Hill Records, helped introduce Cajun and swing music to new audiences across the United States and beyond[4][5].

The Red Stick Ramblers' legacy endures through their impact on the Louisiana music scene and their role in revitalizing interest in Cajun and Western swing styles. Their innovative approach, blending tradition with fresh arrangements and original songwriting, inspired younger musicians and contributed to the ongoing evolution of American roots music[2][5].
