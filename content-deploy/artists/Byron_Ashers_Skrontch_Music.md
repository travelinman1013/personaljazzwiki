## Biography
Byron Asher's Skrontch Music is a large ensemble project led by clarinetist, saxophonist, and composer Byron Asher, based in New Orleans. Raised in Maryland, Asher relocated to New Orleans in 2011, quickly becoming an integral figure in the city’s creative music scene. Skrontch Music was conceived as a platform to explore the intertwined histories of jazz in New Orleans and the socio-political context of the American South, particularly focusing on the legacy of Jim Crow and the blues as a form of resistance. The ensemble’s debut album, 'Byron Asher’s Skrontch Music' (2019), is a five-movement suite for a ten-piece ensemble that weaves together contemporary composition, collective improvisation, archival sound collage, and historical texts, including excerpts from the 1896 Plessy v. Ferguson Supreme Court ruling. The project originated from Asher’s research at the Hogan Jazz Archive at Tulane University, where he delved into oral histories and archival material to better understand the roots of the jazz tradition he performed.

Skrontch Music draws its name from a little-known swing-era dance step popularized by Duke Ellington in the late 1930s, symbolizing the ensemble’s approach of honoring tradition while pushing forward. The group’s second album, 'Lord, when you send the rain' (2024), released on Sinking City Records, meditates on the blues as a Black radical tradition rooted in the Mississippi Delta and its central role in the development of jazz. This work features sound collages with archival interviews and samples from figures such as Fannie Lou Hamer, Bessie Smith, and Ma Rainey. Supported by prestigious fellowships and grants, Skrontch Music has performed across the Deep South, including a tour funded by South Arts, and is recognized for its innovative blending of historical research, social commentary, and adventurous jazz composition.
