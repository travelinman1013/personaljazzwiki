## Biography
The Melvins formed in early 1983 in Montesano, Washington, when three high school friends—Buzz Osborne (guitar, vocals), Matt Lukin (bass), and Mike Dillard (drums)—came together to explore music from their small Pacific Northwest town. Initially playing Jimi Hendrix and Who covers before transitioning to fast hardcore punk, the band's sound underwent a dramatic transformation when Dale Crover replaced Mike Dillard on drums in 1984. Influenced by early Black Sabbath and Black Flag's *My War* era, Osborne and Crover began slowing down their music and creating the sludgy, oppressively heavy sound that would become their trademark. This core duo of Osborne and Crover has remained constant for over four decades, making them one of heavy music's most enduring partnerships.

Throughout their career, the Melvins have been instrumental in pioneering sludge metal and grunge, genres that would come to define heavy music in the 1990s and beyond. Despite never achieving mainstream commercial success—no stadium headliners, no Billboard 200 number ones, no platinum albums—they carved out an enormous influence across heavy music. The band released their debut EP *Six Songs* in 1986 on C/Z Records, followed by their first full-length album *Gluey Porch Treatments* in 1987. Over subsequent decades, they released 19 studio albums while constantly experimenting with lineup configurations, performing as both a trio and as a quartet with either two drummers or two bassists. Their relentless touring schedule became legendary, including a 2012 tour covering all 50 states plus Washington, D.C. in just 51 days.

The Melvins' legacy extends far beyond their own prolific output; they are widely recognized as foundational to the development of grunge and sludge metal, inspiring countless bands including Nirvana and establishing themselves as one of heavy music's most influential acts. Their dark, heavy sound combined with an irreverent spirit and commitment to experimentation has earned them a dedicated global fanbase and the respect of their peers. As of 2023, the band celebrated 40 years of existence with the core lineup of Buzz Osborne and Dale Crover, joined since 2015 by bassist Steve McDonald of Redd Kross. Now based in Southern California, the Melvins continue to push boundaries and remain active in recording and touring.

## Fun Facts
- The band's name was inspired by a grocery clerk named Melvin at the Thriftway in Montesano where Buzz Osborne worked. The employees disliked Melvin, and the band members felt it was an appropriately ridiculous name for their project.
- In 2012, the Melvins embarked on an ambitious tour playing all 50 states plus Washington, D.C. in just 51 days, showcasing their dedication to their craft and fans through an incredible feat of routing and endurance.
- Despite their enormous influence on grunge and sludge metal—genres that defined 1990s heavy music—the Melvins have never headlined a stadium tour, hit number one on the Billboard 200, or released a platinum-selling album, yet remain one of heavy music's most respected and influential bands.
- The band has performed in various configurations including as a quartet with either two drummers or two bassists, demonstrating their experimental approach to lineup arrangements beyond the traditional trio format.
