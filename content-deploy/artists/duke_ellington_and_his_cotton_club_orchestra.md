## Biography
Duke Ellington and His Cotton Club Orchestra, led by Edward Kennedy "Duke" Ellington, was a pivotal force in the development of jazz and big band music in the early 20th century. Born in Washington, D.C. in 1899, Ellington began playing piano as a child and was performing professionally by his teens. After moving to New York City in the early 1920s, he formed the Washingtonians, which evolved into his renowned orchestra. Their breakthrough came in 1927, when they secured a residency at Harlem's Cotton Club—a glamorous, whites-only nightclub that became synonymous with the Harlem Renaissance. The engagement, which lasted several years, brought Ellington's innovative sound to national attention through radio broadcasts and recordings, making him a household name in American music.[1][2][3]

At the Cotton Club, Ellington developed a distinctive style characterized by lush orchestrations, inventive harmonies, and the celebrated "jungle style"—marked by growling brass and exotic rhythms. He wrote or co-wrote over a thousand compositions, many of which became jazz standards, and was known for tailoring pieces to the unique talents of his band members. The orchestra's success at the Cotton Club propelled them onto the international stage, with tours across the United States and Europe, despite facing persistent racial discrimination. Ellington's work not only elevated the status of jazz but also influenced the broader landscape of American music, earning him a reputation as one of the genre's most significant composers and bandleaders.[1][2][3]

Ellington's legacy endures through his extensive catalog, his role in advancing the careers of numerous jazz greats, and his commitment to musical innovation. His orchestra remained active for nearly five decades, and his collaborations—most notably with Billy Strayhorn—produced some of the most celebrated works in jazz history. Ellington's music continues to be performed and studied, reflecting his enduring impact on both jazz and American culture.[2][3]

## Fun Facts
- Ellington's orchestra was one of the first African American bands to achieve national radio exposure, thanks to live broadcasts from the Cotton Club.[1][3]
- The 'jungle style' sound, featuring growling brass and exotic rhythms, was developed to fit the Cotton Club's themed shows and became a signature of Ellington's early work.[1]
- Ellington's band appeared in the 1930 film 'Check and Double Check,' one of the earliest sound films to feature a black orchestra.[1]
- Despite the Cotton Club's fame, its black performers—including Ellington—were not allowed to mingle with the club's white patrons and had to enter through a separate entrance.[3]
