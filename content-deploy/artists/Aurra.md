## Biography
Aurra was a pioneering American post-disco, boogie, and funk group formed in 1979 as a spin-off from the influential funk band Slave. The group was founded by Steve "The Fearless Leader" Washington, who brought together Curt Jones (lead vocals, guitar, percussion), Starleana Young (lead vocals, percussion), Charles Carter (keyboards, flute, sax, vocals), and Buddy Hankerson (bass) for their debut lineup. Both Jones and Young had strong musical backgrounds: Starleana Young was born in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia, and began singing in church choirs at age twelve, later moving to New Jersey and joining Symphonic Express, where she met Jones. Curt Jones, born in Linden, New Jersey, came from a musical family with ties to Motown and big band jazz, further enriching Aurra’s foundation[2].

Aurra quickly established themselves in the early 1980s with a series of successful releases, signing first to Dream Records and then Salsoul Records. Their sound was characterized by infectious grooves, soulful vocals, and a polished blend of funk and boogie. Major hits included "Make Up Your Mind," "Are You Single," and "Checking You Out," with "Make Up Your Mind" reaching #6 on the US R&B chart and #71 on the pop chart[4]. The group underwent several lineup changes, with members from Slave and other associated acts joining at various points. Legal disputes over the Aurra name led Jones and Young to rebrand as Deja in the mid-1980s, continuing their musical journey with hits like "You and Me Tonight" (UK #12, US R&B #2)[1][2].

Aurra’s musical style fused the rhythmic innovation of funk with the melodic sensibilities of post-disco and boogie, helping to shape the sound of early 1980s R&B. Their work influenced a generation of funk and dance musicians, and their collaborative approach—often involving a rotating cast of talented players from the Slave organization—set a precedent for fluid, collective creativity in funk music. Aurra’s legacy endures through their classic tracks, their role in the evolution of boogie and post-disco, and their impact on both contemporaries and successors in the genre[3].

## Fun Facts
- Aurra's lineup was highly fluid, often including members from Slave and other associated acts, making it more of a musical collective than a fixed band[2].
- The group was forced to change its name to Deja due to legal disputes over the Aurra trademark, which was owned by Steve Washington[1][2].
- Starleana Young's vocal style was shaped by listening to Michael Jackson, Minnie Riperton, and Stevie Wonder, as cited in a 1983 Salsoul press bio[2].
- Aurra's hit 'You and Me Tonight' reached #2 on the US R&B chart and #12 on the UK singles chart in 1986, marking their international breakthrough[1][2].
