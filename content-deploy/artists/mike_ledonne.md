## Biography
Mike LeDonne, born October 26, 1956, in Bridgeport, Connecticut, was immersed in music from an early age thanks to his parents' music store and his father, a jazz guitarist. By age five, he began piano lessons, and by ten, he was performing locally, often booked by his father. After high school, LeDonne studied at the New England Conservatory, where he trained under Jaki Byard and John Mehegan, graduating in 1978[3][5].

LeDonne moved to New York City in 1979, joining the Widespread Depression Jazz Orchestra and quickly establishing himself in the jazz scene. He became the house pianist at Jimmy Ryan’s, collaborating with legends such as Roy Eldridge, Papa Jo Jones, and Vic Dickenson. His career flourished as he joined Benny Goodman’s Sextet and later Milt Jackson’s Quartet, where he served as musical director until Jackson’s passing in 1999. LeDonne has released over 20 albums as a leader, and his versatility as both pianist and Hammond organist is showcased in his acclaimed Groover Quartet, which held a long-running residency at Smoke Jazz Club in New York[2][3][4].

LeDonne’s musical style is rooted in hard bop and jazz, blending classical influences with soulful, bluesy organ work. He is celebrated for his technical mastery and expressive improvisation, earning praise from peers like Oscar Peterson. Beyond performance, LeDonne is an educator and advocate, notably founding Disability Pride Day in New York City. His legacy includes shaping modern jazz piano and organ playing, mentoring younger musicians, and championing inclusivity within the arts[3][2][5].
