## Biography
The Glue is a post-grunge band originating from St. Petersburg, Russia, formed in 2004. Emerging in the wake of the global grunge movement, The Glue drew inspiration from the raw, emotional soundscapes pioneered by Seattle bands in the 1990s. Their debut album, 'Never New,' was released the same year as their formation, quickly establishing their presence in Russia's alternative music scene with a sound characterized by heavy guitar riffs, introspective lyrics, and a gritty, melodic sensibility.

Building on their initial momentum, The Glue released a second album, 'These Roses for You,' which continued to explore themes of alienation and resilience, hallmarks of the grunge and post-grunge genres. Their music reflects a deep affinity for the angst and authenticity of grunge, while also incorporating elements unique to their Russian context. Although The Glue has not achieved widespread international fame, they remain a notable example of grunge's enduring influence beyond its American roots, contributing to the genre's global legacy.
