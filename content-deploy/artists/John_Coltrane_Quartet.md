## Biography
John Coltrane, born on September 23, 1926, in Hamlet, North Carolina, was a pivotal figure in jazz history. His early musical influences included his father, a part-time musician, and he began studying clarinet and alto saxophone. Coltrane's career took off when he joined Miles Davis's quintet in 1955, where he developed his skills alongside Davis, Red Garland, Paul Chambers, and Philly Joe Jones. This period was marked by the release of influential albums like *Cookin'*, *Relaxin'*, *Workin'*, and *Steamin'*[1][6]. In 1957, Coltrane worked with Thelonious Monk, further expanding his musical horizons. He formed his first quartet in 1960, featuring McCoy Tyner, Elvin Jones, and Steve Davis, later replaced by Jimmy Garrison. This quartet became renowned for its modal jazz explorations, as seen in *My Favorite Things* and *A Love Supreme*[1][5]. Coltrane's work with Impulse Records from 1961 until his death in 1967 showcased his experimental and spiritual approach to jazz, influencing generations to come[2][6].
