## Biography
Bruce Frederick Joseph Springsteen, born September 23, 1949, in Long Branch, New Jersey, grew up in the working-class town of Freehold. Immersed in the vibrant music scene of Asbury Park during the late 1960s, he played in several local bands, including Steel Mill, before forming the E Street Band in 1972. Springsteen's early albums, 'Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J.' and 'The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle' (both 1973), were critically acclaimed but commercially modest. His breakthrough came with 'Born to Run' (1975), which showcased his poetic, socially conscious lyrics and energetic rock sound, earning him the nickname 'the Boss' and propelling him to national fame.

Springsteen's music is rooted in heartland rock, blending classic rock and roll with narratives about working-class American life. Albums like 'Darkness on the Edge of Town' (1978), 'The River' (1980), and the massively successful 'Born in the U.S.A.' (1984) cemented his reputation as a voice for everyday Americans. Known for marathon live performances and his dynamic stage presence, Springsteen has released 21 studio albums over six decades, often with the E Street Band. His legacy includes numerous Grammy Awards, an Academy Award, and induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, marking him as one of the most influential figures in American music history.
