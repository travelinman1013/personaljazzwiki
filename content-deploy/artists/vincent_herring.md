## Biography
Vincent Herring, born November 19, 1964, in Hopkinsville, Kentucky, is a renowned American jazz saxophonist, flautist, composer, and educator. After his parents divorced, Herring moved with his mother to California, where he began playing the saxophone at age 11, studying privately and performing in school bands. His early promise led to a music scholarship at California State University, Chico at age 16, followed by a stint as lead alto saxophonist in the United States Military Academy band, Jazz Knights, at West Point.

In 1982, Herring relocated to New York City to further his studies at Long Island University, quickly immersing himself in the vibrant jazz scene. He first toured with the Lionel Hampton Big Band before forging a nine-year partnership with Nat Adderley, recording nine albums and touring globally. Herring's career flourished as he collaborated with jazz legends such as Horace Silver, Freddie Hubbard, Cedar Walton, Art Blakey, and Louis Hayes, notably co-founding the Cannonball Adderley Legacy Band. His energetic, soulful, and multi-noted playing style—strongly influenced by Cannonball Adderley—has made him a fixture on the international jazz circuit.

As a bandleader, Herring has released over 20 albums and performed on more than 250 recordings as a sideman. He leads several ensembles, including Something Else, The Battle with Eric Alexander, and Jazz The Story, and is deeply involved in jazz education, mentoring young musicians and conducting clinics worldwide. Herring's legacy is marked by his dynamic artistry, versatility, and commitment to both performance and teaching, making him a key figure in contemporary hard bop and post-bop jazz.
