## Biography
The Treme Brass Band is a celebrated New Orleans brass band founded in the early 1990s by drummer Benny Jones Sr., a veteran musician whose roots in the city's musical traditions run deep. Jones, the son of noted musician Chester Jones, formed the group out of jam sessions at Sidney’s Saloon, gathering a rotating cast of seasoned players and rising stars from the Tremé neighborhood, one of the oldest African American communities in the United States and a cradle of jazz. The band’s name pays homage to this historic district, and its music is steeped in the vibrant, parade-driven culture that defines New Orleans.

Known for their loose, relaxed style and dedication to the traditional brass band repertoire, the Treme Brass Band has become an institution in the city, performing at jazz funerals, street parades, and local venues such as the Candlelight Lounge. Their sound, which features clarinet, trumpet, trombone, tuba, and drums, blends African rhythms, polyphony, and European forms, reflecting the origins of New Orleans jazz. The group has released acclaimed albums like 'Gimme My Money Back' and 'I Got a Big, Fat Woman,' and their rendition of 'Just a Closer Walk With Thee' is emblematic of their role in the city’s musical rituals.

Despite international recognition, including a National Heritage Fellowship from the NEA in 2006, the Treme Brass Band remains deeply rooted in the local community. The band’s membership is fluid, with both veteran musicians and young innovators contributing to its evolving sound. Many former members have gone on to found or join other influential brass bands, ensuring the Treme Brass Band’s legacy as a cornerstone of New Orleans’ musical heritage.
