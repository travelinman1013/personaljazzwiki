## Biography
Jen Chapin is an American singer-songwriter born on Long Island in 1971, who has been celebrated for writing "brilliant soulfully poetic urban folk music" (NPR) for more than two decades.[1] She is the daughter of the late folk-rock artist Harry Chapin, best known for his 1974 smash "Cats in the Cradle," and Sandra Chapin.[5][7] Nurtured in and around New York City by a large family of artists, writers, and musicians, Jen's "observant, lyrically deft, politically aware and emotionally intuitive" songwriting features both her "extraordinary voice" and an "astonishing jazz band."[1] Her artistic development was shaped by her upbringing in a creative household and her father's legacy of socially conscious music.

Jen Chapin's career gained significant traction with her debut studio album "Open Wide" in 2002, following earlier releases including a self-titled EP and "Live at the Bitter End" (recorded over four shows in 1999 at the Greenwich Village landmark).[1] Her musical style bridges multiple genres—described as "potent, jazzy, layered folk" by Newsday—combining original compositions with sophisticated cover arrangements.[1] She has performed on stage with Bruce Springsteen, appeared on bills with Aimee Mann, Bruce Hornsby, and The Neville Brothers, and her rendition of Van Morrison's "Into The Mystic" was featured in the SyFy TV series "Defiance."[1] Her 2013 album "Reckoning," produced by five-time GRAMMY Winner Kevin Killen (known for work with U2, Elvis Costello, and Kate Bush), was named among the best Americana albums of that year and won First Prize in the Lyrics category at the USA Songwriting Competition.[1]

Beyond her musical career, Jen Chapin has maintained a lifetime of passionate activism through ongoing work with WhyHunger, founded by her late father Harry Chapin, and teaching high school global history in Brooklyn.[1] Her latest trio album "Desert or Sea" was released in summer 2019, and she is currently developing "Essential Stories"—a new theatrical concert comprising two decades of songwriting sculpted into an intimate autobiographical narrative of family roots, parenting, and social justice.[1] The Jen Chapin Trio performs songs that bridge several popular styles, combining original compositions with classic covers, featuring her unique approach to songwriting and commitment to speaking truth through music.[3][6]
