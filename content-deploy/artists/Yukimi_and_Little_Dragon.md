## Biography
Yukimi Eleanora Nagano, born January 31, 1982 in Gothenburg, Sweden, is a celebrated singer-songwriter and the charismatic frontwoman of the Grammy-nominated band Little Dragon. Raised by an American mother and Japanese father, Yukimi's multicultural upbringing deeply influenced her artistic sensibilities, blending elements of jazz, soul, electronic pop, hip hop, and psychedelia into her music. Her passion for music blossomed early, and by her teens, she was already writing and performing her own material. Rather than pursue mainstream pop opportunities, she co-founded Little Dragon in 1996 with high school friends Erik Bodin, Fredrik Wallin, and Håkan Wirenstrand, forging a unique sound that would gain international acclaim over seven studio albums, including 2023’s 'Slugs Of Love'[2][5][8].

Yukimi's artistry is marked by her unmistakable voice and her ability to entwine diverse musical styles. With Little Dragon, she helped pioneer a genre-defying blend of nu jazz, synth-pop, and R&B, collaborating with renowned acts such as Gorillaz, De La Soul, DJ Shadow, SBTRKT, and BADBADNOTGOOD. In 2024, Yukimi embarked on a solo career, releasing her debut album 'For You' on Ninja Tune. This project, co-produced with Little Dragon’s Erik Bodin, reflects a more intimate and vulnerable side, exploring themes of love, loss, feminine energy, and resilience. The album’s personal nature is a testament to her evolution as an artist and individual, shaped by motherhood and profound life changes[2][4][8].

Yukimi’s legacy lies in her fearless pursuit of creative freedom and her influence on contemporary electronic and nu jazz music. Her work with Little Dragon and as a solo artist has inspired a new generation of musicians to embrace genre fluidity and emotional honesty, cementing her status as a trailblazer in modern music[2][3][8].
