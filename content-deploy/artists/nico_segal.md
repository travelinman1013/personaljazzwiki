## Biography
Nico Segal, born June 25, 1993, in Chicago, Illinois, began his musical journey as a trumpeter, attending the Merit School of Music where he studied jazz and classical trumpet under masters like Tito Carrillo. He rose to prominence as a founding member of the band Kids These Days in 2009, alongside Vic Mensa, Greg Landfair, and others, blending hip-hop, rock, jazz, and experimental sounds; the group released the Hard Times EP in 2011 and Traphouse Rock mixtape in 2012 before disbanding in 2013.[3][2][5] During this period, Segal released solo projects like the Illasoul: Shades of Blue mixtape in 2012 and Donnie Trumpet EP in 2013, establishing himself as a versatile producer and performer immersed in Chicago's vibrant, genre-blurring music scene.[1][3]

Formerly known as Donnie Trumpet, Segal co-founded The Social Experiment in late 2013 with Chance the Rapper, Peter Cottontale, Greg Landfair Jr., and Nate Fox, crafting an eclectic mix of jazz, R&B, hip-hop, and gospel; their debut album Surf (2015) was a free iTunes download that amassed over 618,000 downloads in its first week, featuring guests like Erykah Badu and Janelle Monáe.[1][3][2] He earned a Grammy for production on Chance the Rapper's Coloring Book and has collaborated with artists including J. Cole, Ed Sheeran, Kanye West, Bleachers, and Neil Young, while performing on high-profile stages like Saturday Night Live (three times), the Obama White House, ESPYS, and NY Jazz Fest.[1][2] Segal dropped the Donnie Trumpet moniker in 2016 following the U.S. presidential election.[3]

Segal's style reflects Chicago's fusion ethos, drawing from house, avant-garde jazz (AACM), and local jam sessions with influences like Von Freeman and Victor Garcia; later projects include The JuJu Exchange (Exchange in 2017, JazzRx in 2023), Intellexual (2019) with Nate Fox, and his solo album Tell the Ghost Welcome Home (2023), marking a personal reintroduction amid a career defined by collaboration.[5][3][2]

## Fun Facts
