## Biography
Fela Kuti, born Olufela Olusegun Oludotun Ransome-Kuti on October 15, 1938, in Abeokuta, Nigeria, was the son of a prominent Anglican minister and a renowned political activist. Raised in a well-educated family, he began learning piano and drums in childhood, later attending Trinity College of Music in London, where he immersed himself in classical music and jazz[1][5][6][9]. Initially expected to study medicine, Fela pursued music, forming his first band, Koola Lobitos, which blended West African highlife with jazz influences[1][3][6][9].

Returning to Nigeria in the early 1960s, Fela developed the genre of Afrobeat, fusing highlife, funk, jazz, and traditional Yoruba rhythms into a politically charged musical style[1][2][6][9]. His lyrics, often critical of Nigeria's military regimes and social injustices, led to frequent arrests and harassment. Fela's bands, notably Africa 70 and Egypt 80, featured large ensembles and complex arrangements, with drummer Tony Allen as a key collaborator[1][6]. His home and studio, the Kalakuta Republic, became a symbol of resistance and creativity, though it was repeatedly raided by authorities.

Fela Kuti's legacy is profound: he released over 50 albums, inspired generations of musicians, and became an icon of Pan-Africanism and activism[1][2][6]. His influence extended beyond music into political life, founding the Movement of the People party and advocating for social change. Fela died on August 2, 1997, in Lagos, Nigeria, but his impact endures through his music, his children (notably Femi and Seun Kuti), and the global popularity of Afrobeat[1][2][6].
