## Biography
Serenata Guayanesa is a Venezuelan vocal and instrumental quartet founded in June 1971 in Ciudad Bolívar, in the Guayana region along the Orinoco River.[2][3][5] The original members—Hernán Gamboa (tenor and first cuatro), Iván Pérez Rossi (baritone and second cuatro), César Pérez Rossi (baritone and percussion), and Mauricio Castro Rodríguez (countertenor and percussion)—had prior experience in choral and vocal groups such as the Orfeón de la Universidad de Los Andes and began singing informally at the home of the state governor, Manuel Guarrido.[2] Impressed by their performance, Guarrido encouraged them to record an LP of typical music from the Guayana region, which they did with a local ensemble led by veteran musician and composer Carmito Gamboa, father of Hernán.[2] A copy of this LP reportedly reached the Caracas television channel Cadena Venezolana de Televisión; when the group appeared on a variety show and was asked its name, one member simply answered with the LP title, “Serenata Guayanesa,” effectively baptizing the group on air.[2]

Seeking wider recognition, the quartet recorded a talent demo that secured its first recording contract in 1972 with Palacio de la Música, whose LPs were released under the Decca‑London imprint in Venezuela.[2][1] Their early national breakthrough came with “Serenata Guayanesa Volumen 2” (1973), featuring “Calypso del Callao” and the now-classic Venezuelan Christmas song “Aguinaldo Criollo,” which cemented their reputation as leading interpreters of diverse Venezuelan folk traditions.[2] Over the decades they have recorded an extensive discography for labels such as London‑Palacio and Sonográfica, including children’s albums like “Cantemos con los niños,” Christmas releases, and live recordings such as “Una Amistad de 25 Años,” captured at the Teatro Teresa Carreño with guest artists including María Teresa Chacín and gaita singers Ricardo Cepeda and Abdenago “Neguito” Borjas.[1][2] After Hernán Gamboa’s departure in 1984, tenor and cuatro/guitarist Miguel Ángel Bosch joined the group, stabilizing the classic lineup with Iván and César Pérez Rossi and Mauricio Castro Rodríguez.[1][2]

Musically, Serenata Guayanesa is known for finely crafted contrapuntal vocal arrangements and the instrumental combination of Venezuelan cuatro, guitar, and light percussion, applied to a wide palette of genres: calypso from El Callao, aguinaldos and villancicos, joropos, golpes, children’s songs, and boleros, among others.[2][3][5] Their work has been described as a “living treasure” of Venezuela’s musical and cultural heritage, reflecting rigorous musicianship and a strong commitment to traditional repertoire while presenting it with clarity and charm suitable for audiences of all ages.[3][5] Their cultural importance has been formally recognized: in November 2011 the group was declared Cultural Heritage of Venezuela by presidential decree published in the Official Gazette,[2] and later recognitions have reiterated their status as one of the country’s emblematic folk ensembles.[4] Through more than five decades of activity, Serenata Guayanesa has become, alongside groups like Un Solo Pueblo, one of the best-known and most influential exponents of Venezuelan traditional music, preserving regional styles and songs for future generations.[2][4][5]

## Fun Facts
- When the group recorded its very first LP of Guayanese music, they did not yet have a formal name; they improvised “Serenata Guayanesa” on live television when a presenter asked for the group’s name, simply borrowing the album title on the spot.[2]
- Serenata Guayanesa’s early national fame was driven in part by two very different kinds of songs on the same 1973 LP: the carnival-style “Calypso del Callao” and the Christmas aguinaldo “Aguinaldo Criollo,” both of which became staples of Venezuelan festive music.[2]
- Beyond Venezuelan joropos and aguinaldos, the group has also recorded classic boleros such as “Desesperanza,” blending romantic Latin genres into their folk-focused repertoire while still using their trademark four-part vocal arrangements.[2][3]
- On the occasion of their 25th anniversary, the group celebrated with a major concert at Caracas’s prestigious Teatro Teresa Carreño, later released as a double live album featuring an all-star lineup of Venezuelan guest artists from different regional styles, including gaita and popular song.[2]

## Musical Connections

### Mentors/Influences
- [[carmito_gamboa|Carmito Gamboa]] - Veteran musician and composer from Bolívar state who led the ensemble that accompanied the quartet on its first LP of Guayana-region music; as Hernán Gamboa’s father and the senior figure on the project, he served as a direct musical mentor and stylistic guide in regional folk traditions. (First LP of Guayanese traditional music recorded in Ciudad Bolívar before the group’s national breakthrough (early 1970s).) [circa 1971–1973]

### Key Collaborators
- [[gualberto_ibarreto|Gualberto Ibarreto]] - Renowned Venezuelan vocalist, cuatrista, and violinist invited as a featured guest on a later LP, where Serenata Guayanesa both hosted him and provided vocal/instrumental accompaniment. (Navidad/party LP “Viene la parranda,” on which the group collaborated with Ibarreto as guest artist.) [mid‑1980s (post‑1984, during their Sonográfica period)]
- [[maría_teresa_chacín|María Teresa Chacín]] - Prominent Venezuelan singer who appeared as a guest in the group’s 25th‑anniversary live concert and recording at the Teatro Teresa Carreño. (Double live album “Una Amistad de 25 Años,” recorded at Teatro Teresa Carreño.) [circa mid‑1990s (25th anniversary period)]
- [[ricardo_cepeda|Ricardo Cepeda]] - Exponent of gaita zuliana who joined the group onstage and on record for their 25th‑anniversary live album, blending Zulian gaita with the quartet’s vocal style. (“Una Amistad de 25 Años” (live double album, guest appearance).) [circa mid‑1990s]
- [[abdenago_neguito_borjas|Abdenago “Neguito” Borjas]] - Well-known gaita zuliana singer-songwriter who also participated as a guest artist in Serenata Guayanesa’s 25th‑anniversary concert recording. (“Una Amistad de 25 Años” (live double album, guest appearance).) [circa mid‑1990s]
- [[asdrúbal_cheo_hurtado|Asdrúbal “Cheo” Hurtado]] - Virtuoso instrumentalist who contributed an elegant guitar solo to the group’s studio recording of the bolero “Desesperanza,” expanding their usual cuatro-based texture. (Recording of “Desesperanza” for the project/album “¡Canta con Venezuela! Sing with Venezuela!”) [recorded in Ciudad Bolívar, documented by Smithsonian Folkways (2000s–2010s era documentation)]

### Artists Influenced
- [[unspecified_younger_venezuelan_folk_and_childrens-music_ensembles|Unspecified younger Venezuelan folk and children’s-music ensembles]] - Serenata Guayanesa is widely cited in institutional and press materials as a ‘living treasure’ and emblematic interpreter of Venezuelan folk song; their contrapuntal vocal approach, children’s albums, and Christmas/folk repertoire have become reference models that later folk groups and children’s music projects emulate in style and repertoire selection. (Influence visible in the widespread adoption and re-recording of songs they popularized, such as “Calypso del Callao” and “Aguinaldo Criollo,” as well as in pedagogical and children’s-music projects modeled on “Cantemos con los niños.”) [late 1970s to present]
