## Biography
Milt Shaw, born Milton Shaw on July 2, 1889, in Ann Arbor, Michigan, was an American violinist who led the dance band Milt Shaw and His Detroiters during the late 1920s and early 1930s. The band originated in 1927 when Shaw took over a Philadelphia-based group previously led by Frank Winegar and relocated it to Detroit, where it gained popularity in the local scene[2][7]. Active primarily in the Detroit area, the ensemble recorded a handful of sides for Brunswick Records, including tracks like 'Daughter of the Latin Quarter' in 1930 and 'Where The Shy Little Violets Grow' in 1928, showcasing their dance band style[4][8].

Shaw's Detroiters featured notable young musicians early in their careers, such as drummer Ray McKinley, who joined at age 15 around 1925-1927 before moving on to other bands[1][3][5]. The group's sound aligned with the hot jazz and dance music trends of the era, though specific details on Shaw's early training or stylistic development remain limited. By February 1931, Shaw disbanded the group, possibly feeling he had reached the height of its popularity[6].

Little is documented about Shaw's life after 1931 or his broader legacy, as the band operated regionally without achieving national prominence. Their recordings represent a snapshot of pre-swing dance band music in the Midwest, with McKinley's later success in big band jazz providing an indirect link to swing era developments[3].
