## Biography
Fi Yi Yi & The Mandingo Warriors is a renowned Black Masking Indian tribe from New Orleans, founded and led by Big Chief Victor Harris. Harris, born and raised in the 7th Ward of New Orleans, began his journey in the Mardi Gras Indian tradition as a flag boy for the Yellow Pocahontas tribe under the mentorship of the legendary Allison 'Tootie' Montana. After a falling out with the Yellow Pocahontas in 1984, Harris experienced a spiritual vision that inspired him to create his own tribe, the Spirit of Fi Yi Yi & The Mandingo Warriors, debuting a distinctive African-inspired style and philosophy rooted in both resistance and cultural pride.

The Mandingo Warriors quickly became known for their unique suits, which diverged from traditional Mardi Gras Indian attire by using layered beads and cowrie shells instead of feathers and cardboard. Harris’s suits also feature African-style masks that fully cover the face, creating a mystical and shamanic presence. Over the decades, Harris and his close collaborators, including master suit designer Jack Robertson and master drummer Wesley Phillips, have elevated the tribe’s performances into total works of art, blending music, dance, and spiritual storytelling. The group’s influence has been documented in the book 'Fire in the Hole: The Spirit Work of Fi Yi Yi & the Mandingo Warriors,' and their legacy is preserved in institutions like the Backstreet Cultural Museum.

Victor Harris, as Big Chief, has led the Mandingo Warriors for nearly 60 years, becoming the longest continuously masking Indian in New Orleans history. His leadership has not only shaped the visual and musical language of the tribe but has also inspired generations of artists and musicians, ensuring the survival and evolution of Black Masking Indian traditions in the city.
