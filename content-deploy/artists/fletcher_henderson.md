## Biography
Fletcher Henderson (December 18, 1897 – December 29, 1952) was a pioneering American pianist, bandleader, arranger, and composer who played a central role in the development of big band jazz and swing music. Born in Cuthbert, Georgia, Henderson was raised in a middle-class African-American family; his father was a school principal and his mother a teacher who introduced him and his brother Horace to the piano at an early age. Though he excelled in music from childhood, Henderson initially pursued academics, earning a degree in chemistry and mathematics from Atlanta University in 1920.[1][2]

After moving to New York City to seek work as a chemist, Henderson turned to music when he was unable to find employment in his field, likely due to racial discrimination. He began his professional career as a song demonstrator and house pianist for Black Swan Records, accompanying prominent blues singers such as Ethel Waters, Bessie Smith, and Ma Rainey. By 1921, Henderson had formed his own orchestra, which quickly became a fixture in New York's jazz scene and was credited with creating the first big band orchestra in the city. His ensemble featured top musicians and arrangers like Don Redman and later, Louis Armstrong, whose improvisational style helped shape the band's innovative sound and paved the way for the swing era.[2][3][4]

Henderson's arrangements, characterized by their sophisticated blend of tight ensemble work and space for solo improvisation, became the template for swing music. Though his own orchestra's popularity waned by the mid-1930s, Henderson's legacy was cemented through his work as an arranger for Benny Goodman, whose success in launching the Swing Era owed much to Henderson's charts. Henderson continued to work as an arranger and occasional bandleader throughout the 1930s and 1940s, influencing countless musicians and ensembles. He is widely recognized as one of the most influential figures in jazz history, bridging the gap between Dixieland and swing and laying the groundwork for modern big band jazz.[1][2][4]
