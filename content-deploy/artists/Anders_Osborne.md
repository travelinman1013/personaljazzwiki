## Biography
Anders Osborne, born in 1966 in Uddevalla, Sweden, displayed a passion for music and poetry from an early age, drawing inspiration from a diverse range of artists including Vivaldi, Chopin, Black Sabbath, Robert Johnson, Joni Mitchell, Van Morrison, John Coltrane, and Bob Marley. His early musical explorations led him to experiment with open D tuning, a technique he first encountered on Joni Mitchell's 'Blue,' which became a signature element of his guitar style. In his late teens, Osborne traveled throughout Europe, and at nineteen, he visited New Orleans—a city whose vibrant musical culture captivated him so deeply that he decided to stay permanently[1][2][3].

Osborne released his debut album 'Doin’ Fine' in 1989, writing nearly all of his material and quickly establishing himself as a prolific songwriter. Over the decades, he became a fixture in the New Orleans music scene, celebrated for his blend of modern blues, blues rock, folk, and singer-songwriter traditions. His songs have been recorded by a wide array of artists, including Keb' Mo', Tim McGraw, Brad Paisley, Aaron Neville, and Trombone Shorty. Osborne's live performances are renowned for their emotional intensity and dynamic range, balancing heavy, rock-influenced sounds with introspective, lyrical songwriting. He has been honored as Entertainer of the Year by Gambit Weekly, named Best Guitarist three times and Best Songwriter twice by OffBeat, and has performed at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival for over 35 years[1][2][3].

Osborne's legacy is deeply intertwined with the New Orleans musical community, where he is regarded as a 'poet laureate' of Louisiana's roots music. Beyond his solo work, he has collaborated with a host of notable musicians and bands, and his influence extends to both peers and younger generations of artists. His personal journey, including his commitment to sobriety and meditation, has also shaped his music and public persona, making him a respected figure both on and off the stage[1][3].
