## Biography
Dan Auerbach is an American guitarist, singer, songwriter, and producer best known as one half of the blues-rock duo The Black Keys. Born on May 14, 1979, in Akron, Ohio, he grew up in a musical household; his father, Chuck Auerbach, was an avid music fan and songwriter, and extended family exposed him early to blues and roots music.[1][6] Auerbach began playing guitar as a teenager and bonded with childhood friend Patrick Carney over a shared love of raw, stripped-down blues and garage rock, eventually forming The Black Keys in Akron in 2001 as a home-recording project.[1][2] Working largely in basements and makeshift studios around their hometown, the duo released their debut album in 2002 and slowly built a reputation for gritty, lo-fi blues-rock that drew heavily on vintage tones and traditional American roots music.[1][2]

Through the 2000s, Auerbach developed in parallel as a bandleader and studio craftsman, engineering and producing early Black Keys records with Carney in unconventional recording spaces, including a former tire factory for the 2004 album "Rubber Factory."[2] After four self-produced albums, they worked with producer Danger Mouse on 2008’s "Attack & Release," which marked a stylistic expansion and their first experience in a fully professional studio.[1] Around the same time, Auerbach began recording on his own at a studio he built behind his house in Akron; informal experiments there became his 2009 solo debut "Keep It Hid," a record that showcased a broader palette of folk, soul, and psychedelic influences while maintaining his blues-based core.[2][3] The Black Keys’ commercial breakthrough arrived with the Grammy-winning album "Brothers" (2010) and its hit single “Tighten Up,” followed by "El Camino" (2011), establishing Auerbach as a central figure in contemporary blues rock.[1][2][3]

In 2010 Auerbach relocated to Nashville, Tennessee, where he founded the Easy Eye Sound studio and later the Easy Eye Sound label, creating a hub for recording and producing a wide array of artists across rock, soul, country, and modern blues.[1][2][3] From this base he has produced and collaborated on albums by artists such as Dr. John, The Pretenders, Lana Del Rey, and many others, earning multiple Grammy nominations for Producer of the Year and becoming one of the most in-demand producers in American roots music.[1][3][7] Alongside his solo work and productions, he has fronted side projects like The Arcs and continued to record and tour widely with The Black Keys, whose success and longevity have cemented his reputation as a key bridge between traditional blues forms and modern rock, with a legacy defined by analog warmth, songcraft steeped in American roots traditions, and a prolific studio career that has shaped the sound of 21st-century blues and rock.[1][2][3][5]

## Fun Facts
- The Black Keys began essentially as a recording experiment: Auerbach and Patrick Carney were making four-track tapes in Akron basements and landed a record deal before ever playing a live show.[1]
- Before working with big-name producers, The Black Keys recorded an album in a former tire-manufacturing plant in Akron, which they dubbed "Rubber Factory" in homage to the building’s industrial past.[2]
- Auerbach was so taken with classic studios like Muscle Shoals that he built his own backyard studio in Akron; informal sessions there, mainly to test vintage gear, accidentally evolved into his first solo album "Keep It Hid."[2]
- After moving to Nashville in 2010, Auerbach turned Easy Eye Sound into a creative hub where sessions have ranged from Dr. John and The Pretenders to Lana Del Rey, helping earn him multiple Grammy nominations for Producer of the Year.[1][3]
