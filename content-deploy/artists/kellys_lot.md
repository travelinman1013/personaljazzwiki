## Biography
Kelly's Lot is a blues and blues rock band founded in 1994 by Kelly Zirbes, a singer-songwriter originally rooted in folk music. The band was formed when Kelly, encouraged by bassist Alex Rylance, transitioned from solo acoustic performances to assembling a full band and quickly became a fixture in the Los Angeles music scene, debuting at the Roxy in Hollywood. Early members included Homero Chavez (drums), Greg Granieri (bass), and David Walsh (guitar), with their initial sound blending folk rock and singer-songwriter sensibilities.[3][1]

The band's musical direction shifted significantly in 1996 when Texas guitarist and soundman Perry Robertson joined. Robertson not only produced their live album at the Troubadour but also brought Southern Rock and Texas Blues influences, deepening the band's blues orientation. Over three decades, Kelly's Lot has released 17 albums and toured extensively across the USA and Europe, performing at major festivals such as BeachLife Ranch, Waterfront Blues Festival, and Nuits de Sologne. Their style is characterized by heartfelt blues, energetic rock, and Americana, with Kelly's emotive vocals and Perry's bluesy guitar work at the core.[1][4][7]

Kelly's Lot is celebrated for their longevity, versatility, and commitment to the blues genre, often performing as anything from a duo to an eight-piece band. Their music has appeared in films and television, and their collaborative approach—especially between Kelly and Perry—has resulted in a dynamic catalog that spans folk, blues, rock, and roots. The band continues to evolve, recently releasing 'The Blues Remind Me' in 2024 and planning a new roots/rock album, 'Late Bloomer,' for August 2025.[1][5][7]
