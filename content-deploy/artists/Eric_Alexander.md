## Biography
Eric Alexander, born August 4, 1968, in Galesburg, Illinois, is a renowned American jazz tenor saxophonist celebrated for his sophisticated hard bop and post-bop style[1][4]. Alexander began his musical journey with classical piano at age six, switched to clarinet at nine, and then to alto saxophone at twelve. His passion for jazz led him to the tenor saxophone during his studies at Indiana University, where he initially focused on classical music before transferring to William Paterson University in New Jersey. There, he studied under jazz luminaries such as Harold Mabern, Joe Lovano, Rufus Reid, Norman Simmons, and Steve Turre, laying the foundation for his future career[1][2][4].

Alexander's breakthrough came in 1991 when he placed second at the prestigious Thelonious Monk International Jazz Saxophone Competition, behind Joshua Redman and ahead of Chris Potter and Tim Warfield[1][2][3]. This recognition quickly propelled him into the professional jazz scene, where he made his recording debut with organist Charles Earland and released his first album as a leader, "Straight Up," in 1992[3][4]. Over the following decades, Alexander established himself as a prolific recording artist, releasing over 36 albums as a leader and appearing on more than 300 recordings as a sideman. He co-founded the acclaimed sextet One For All, featuring Jim Rotondi, Steve Davis, Joe Farnsworth, Peter Washington, and Dave Hazeltine, and has collaborated with numerous jazz greats including Harold Mabern, Ron Carter, Idris Muhammad, Pat Martino, and Mel Rhyne[1][2][3][4].

Known for his warm, burnished tone and robust melodic imagination, Alexander draws inspiration from the bebop tradition, citing influences such as [[thelonious_monk]], [[sonny_stitt]], [[01_Projects/PersonalArtistWiki/Artists/Sonny_Rollins]], Jackie McLean, Joe Henderson, and [[John_Coltrane]]. His playing is characterized by a deep understanding of jazz language, harmonic sophistication, and a commitment to advancing the genre while honoring its roots. Alexander's legacy is marked by his dedication to both performance and education, his extensive discography, and his role in shaping contemporary hard bop jazz[2][4].
