## Biography
Eliza Sophie Caird, known professionally as **ELIZA** (and formerly as **Eliza Doolittle**), is an English singer and songwriter from Westminster, London, England.[2] She began performing her own material in live venues around London at about 15, gradually building a local following with intimate gigs and developing a sound that drew on pop, soul, and classic songwriting.[2] Her early career breakthrough came after signing to Parlophone in 2008, leading to the release of her self‑titled debut album *Eliza Doolittle* in July 2010, which went Platinum in the UK and produced two UK Top 40 hits, "Skinny Genes" and "Pack Up" (the latter reaching the Top 5).[2] During this period she was associated with a bright, upbeat pop image and sound, and she also appeared on high‑profile stages and festivals, helping to establish her as a mainstream UK pop act.[3][4]

Through the early 2010s, ELIZA broadened her musical footprint beyond her own records, notably contributing writing and vocals to "You & Me" on Disclosure’s 2013 debut album *Settle*, a modern UK garage‑influenced track that became a Top 10 UK single and a defining collaboration in her catalog.[2][4] After releasing two albums with Parlophone, she left the major label system, later describing the move as feeling like "leaving a band," and sought more creative autonomy.[4] Around 2017 she rebranded from Eliza Doolittle to ELIZA and shifted stylistically toward lo‑fi, alternative R&B and neo‑soul, emphasizing introspective themes and a more intimate, groove‑driven sound.[3][4] Her independent work, culminating in albums such as *A Sky Without Stars* (2022), showcases a darker, more mature aesthetic that reflects influences from classic and contemporary R&B while underlining her evolution from chart‑oriented pop singer to a more self‑directed, artist‑led project.[1][3][4]

In this later phase, ELIZA’s music blends R&B, soul and pop with a modern yet vintage feel, and critics have highlighted how her songs often explore love, heartbreak, self‑discovery and emotional healing.[1][4] She cites artists like Aaliyah and even *Kid A*‑era Radiohead among the touchpoints for her current sonic palette, framing her albums as cohesive, mood‑driven experiences rather than collections of radio singles.[4] Live, she has headlined respected venues such as The Jazz Cafe and KOKO in London and has appeared at major festivals including Glastonbury and others, reinforcing her reputation as a compelling performer capable of both energetic and deeply atmospheric sets.[1] As an independent artist working within alternative R&B, ELIZA’s legacy to date lies in successfully reinventing herself beyond early pop fame, using her platform and experience to pursue a more personal, spiritually and socially attuned form of soul‑inflected music that aims, in her own words, to help "change the world for better in [her] own little way."[4]

## Fun Facts
- ELIZA first rose to prominence under the stage name **Eliza Doolittle**, a direct reference to the character from *My Fair Lady*/*Pygmalion*, before dropping the surname and re‑emerging simply as ELIZA when she shifted to a darker, more R&B‑oriented sound around 2017.[3][4]
- Her 2010 debut album *Eliza Doolittle* went **Platinum in the UK**, powered by hit singles like "Pack Up" and "Skinny Genes," firmly establishing her as a mainstream British pop artist early in her career.[2]
- ELIZA’s collaboration "You & Me" with Disclosure became both a UK Top 10 single and a modern UK garage staple, and she has spoken about how natural the collaboration felt, emerging through mutual producer friend Jimmy Napes.[2][4]
- After leaving her major label Parlophone, ELIZA described the experience as "like leaving a band" and has emphasized how going independent and changing her name allowed her to regain creative control and reshape her artistic identity.[4]

## Musical Connections

### Mentors/Influences
- [[aaliyah|Aaliyah]] - Artistic and stylistic influence on ELIZA’s later lo‑fi, alternative R&B direction; cited as one of her favourite artists whose cool, understated approach informs the mood and vocal feel of albums like *A Sky Without Stars*. (Influence heard broadly across ELIZA’s R&B work, particularly on *A Sky Without Stars*.) [Influence particularly evident from mid‑2010s rebrand onward.[4]]
- [[radiohead_kid_a_era|Radiohead (Kid A era)]] - Referential influence on atmosphere and experimental edge; ELIZA has pointed to *Kid A*‑era Radiohead as part of the sonic palette inspiring the introspective, textural production of her later records. (Indirect influence on ELIZA’s album *A Sky Without Stars*.) [Cited in relation to her 2020s work under the name ELIZA.[4]]
- [[whitney_houston|Whitney Houston]] - Classic soul and R&B vocal inspiration, reflecting ELIZA’s grounding in emotive, melodic singing even as she moved into more alternative R&B territory. (General vocal and stylistic influence across ELIZA’s catalog, particularly her soulful delivery.) [Ongoing, foundational influence referenced in profiles of her R&B and soul sound.[1]]
- [[aretha_franklin|Aretha Franklin]] - Influence on ELIZA’s appreciation of soul music’s emotional depth and expressive vocal style.

### Key Collaborators
- [[disclosure|Disclosure]] - High‑profile collaboration as featured vocalist and co‑writer on UK garage‑influenced single "You & Me," which helped bridge her pop background with the electronic/club world.

- [[vic_mensa|Vic Mensa]] - Cross‑genre collaboration linking ELIZA’s pop/R&B sensibilities with hip‑hop, reflecting her willingness to experiment with different scenes during and after her rebrand.

[Mid‑to‑late 2010s, around the period of her transition from Eliza Doolittle to ELIZA.[3]]
- [[wookie|Wookie]] - Collaboration with UK garage artist Wookie, reinforcing ELIZA’s ties to the UK garage and club tradition that also underpins her work with Disclosure.

- [[jesse_james_solomon|Jesse James Solomon]] - Featured duet partner on moody, R&B‑leaning tracks that showcase ELIZA’s integration of rap and spoken‑word textures alongside her vocals.
