## Biography
Makaya McCraven is a French-born, American jazz drummer, composer, and producer celebrated for his innovative approach to jazz and genre-blending artistry. Born in Paris in 1983 to Hungarian singer and flutist Ágnes Zsigmondi and American jazz drummer Stephen McCraven, Makaya was immersed in music from an early age, performing in his father's drum ensemble by age five. Raised in Northampton, Massachusetts, he absorbed a rich tapestry of musical influences from his parents and their creative community, which included jazz luminaries such as Archie Shepp, Marion Brown, and Yusef Lateef.

McCraven’s early career saw him forming the jazz-hip hop band Cold Duck Complex in high school, opening for acts like Wu-Tang Clan and Digable Planets. He studied jazz at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, where he became part of the university's jazz orchestra and received DownBeat student awards. In 2007, he relocated to Chicago, quickly establishing himself in the city’s vibrant jazz scene and collaborating with artists such as Willie Pickens, Jeff Parker, and Marquis Hill. His breakthrough came with the 2015 album 'In the Moment,' which showcased his signature technique of blending live improvisation with hip-hop-inspired production, earning him international acclaim.

McCraven’s musical style is marked by a seamless fusion of jazz, hip-hop, and electronic music, often described as 'nu jazz' or 'free jazz.' He is recognized for his 'beat scientist' approach, using studio techniques to collage and recontextualize live recordings. His albums, including 'Universal Beings' (2018) and 'In These Times' (2022), feature collaborations with musicians from New York, London, and Los Angeles, and have helped redefine the boundaries of contemporary jazz. McCraven’s legacy is that of a cultural synthesizer, bridging generations and genres while inspiring a new wave of jazz musicians to explore the possibilities of improvisation and production.
