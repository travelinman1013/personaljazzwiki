## Biography
Father Ron Clingenpeel, known musically as Father Ron, is a retired Episcopal priest and lifelong musician originally from Nebraska. His musical journey began in the 1960s, performing in rock bands and later exploring a wide range of genres including funk, zydeco, Cajun, blues, and folk. Deeply influenced by the folk rock movement and artists such as The Byrds and Lovin’ Spoonful, Father Ron’s early experiences shaped his approach to both performance and composition, leading him to master guitar, harmonica, and ukulele. 

After moving to New Orleans, Father Ron served as priest at the Chapel of the Holy Spirit near Tulane University, while also immersing himself in the city’s vibrant music scene. He became a prominent advocate for American folk music, both as a solo artist and with his band, Father Ron and Friends. The group, formed after a tribute to Pete Seeger in 2014, features Robert Eustis (guitar), David Schwartz (keyboards), Barbara Smith-Davis (vocals), and Max Valentino (bass), and is known for celebrating the American experience through folk and Americana. Father Ron’s compositions, such as those on the albums 'On My Way Home' and 'Forever the Seasons,' blend spiritual, Western, folk, and blues influences, earning multiple Global Music Awards. 

In addition to performing, Father Ron is a folk DJ on New Orleans’ WWOZ radio and the house composer for Little Boxes of Good News, writing songs for children and families. His legacy is marked by his efforts to introduce new generations to the rich history of American folk music, organizing singalongs and porch concerts that foster community and connection.
