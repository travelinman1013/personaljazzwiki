## Biography
Sue Foley, born March 29, 1968, in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, grew up in a working-class family in the Mechanicsville neighborhood, where she was exposed to music early on. She began playing guitar at age 13, inspired by the Rolling Stones and a live James Cotton concert at 15, which solidified her commitment to blues guitar. By 16, she performed professionally with local Ottawa bands, and after high school, moved to Vancouver in the mid-1980s, forming the Sue Foley Band and touring Canada extensively.[1][2][4]

In 1989, after touring with Mark Hummel and catching the attention of Clifford Antone while sitting in with Duke Robillard, Foley relocated to Austin, Texas, at age 21. She signed with Antone's Records, releasing her acclaimed debut *Young Girl Blues* in 1992, followed by albums like *Without a Warning* (1993) and *Big City Blues* (1995). Known for her fiery Texas blues style blended with refined acoustic playing, she shared stages with B.B. King, Buddy Guy, Jimmie Vaughan, and others. In 1997, she returned to Canada to raise her son, winning a Juno Award for *Love Comin' Down* (2001), 17 Maple Blues Awards, three Trophees de Blues de France, and five Blues Music Awards, including the 2025 Koko Taylor Award.[1][2][3][6]

Foley's career continued with breakthroughs like *The Ice Queen* (2018, featuring Billy Gibbons and Jimmie Vaughan) and *One Guitar Woman* (2024), a solo acoustic tribute to female guitar pioneers, nominated for a 2025 Grammy for Best Traditional Blues Album. She remains a top modern blues artist, scholar, and author, with *Guitar Women* forthcoming in 2026.[2][3][4]
