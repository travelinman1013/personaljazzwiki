## Biography
Antonio Adolfo, born Antônio Adolfo Maurity Sabóia, grew up in a musical family in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where his mother, Yolanda Maurity, was a violinist in the Brazilian Symphony Orchestra. He began music studies at age seven with violin under Paulina D'Ambrozzio, switched to piano at 15 studying with teachers including Amyrton Vallim, Werther Politano, Wilma Graça, Eumir Deodato, and later Nadia Boulanger in Paris in 1973. By 17, he was a professional musician leading his own trio in Bossa Nova and jazz shows across Brazil, touring with prominent singers like Leny Andrade, Carlos Lyra, Flora Purim, Wilson Simonal, Elis Regina, and Milton Nascimento in the 1960s.[1][2][3][5]

Adolfo's career evolved as a pianist, composer, arranger, and producer, pioneering independent music production in Brazil with his 1977 label Artezanal and album Feito em Casa. He composed hits like 'Pretty World' (originally 'Sa Marina'), covered by Sergio Mendes, Stevie Wonder, Herb Alpert, Earl Klugh, and Dionne Warwick, and won international song contests in Rio (1969-1970) and Athens (1970). Releasing over 25 albums as a leader, he has performed globally, including U.S. jazz festivals, and worked on tributes to Brazilian composers like Chiquinha Gonzaga and Ernesto Nazareth. His style blends sophisticated jazz with Brazilian rhythms, including bossa nova, samba, and latin jazz.[1][2][3][4]

As an educator, Adolfo founded a music school in Rio in 1985 now serving over 1,300 students, authored books on Brazilian music, and taught worldwide, including at Centro Calouste Gulbenkian with peers like Pascoal Meirelles. A multi-Latin Grammy nominee, his legacy spans six decades as Brazil's leading jazz pianist, arranger, and producer, influencing generations through recordings, performances, and education.[1][2][3][4]
