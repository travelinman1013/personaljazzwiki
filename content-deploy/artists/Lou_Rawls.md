## Biography
Lou Rawls was born on December 1, 1933, in Chicago, Illinois, where he began singing in a Baptist church choir as a child. His early musical experiences were deeply rooted in gospel, and he performed alongside Sam Cooke in the 1950s gospel group Teenage Kings of Harmony. After serving in the army and recovering from a serious car accident in 1958, Rawls transitioned to secular music, debuting with the jazz album 'Stormy Monday' in 1962 and quickly establishing himself as a versatile vocalist capable of moving between jazz, soul, gospel, and R&B.

Rawls's breakthrough came with the 1966 album 'Soulin’', which featured his first major hit, 'Love Is a Hurtin’ Thing.' He became known for his smooth baritone, charismatic stage presence, and innovative spoken monologues within songs, a precursor to rap. Over his four-decade career, Rawls released more than 50 albums, won three Grammy Awards (for 'Dead End Street' in 1967, 'A Natural Man' in 1971, and 'Unmistakably Lou' in 1977), and achieved his greatest commercial success with the 1976 hit 'You’ll Never Find Another Love Like Mine.'

Beyond music, Rawls was a prominent philanthropist, raising over $200 million for the United Negro College Fund through his annual telethon. He also appeared in films and television, lending his voice to animated series and acting in movies. Lou Rawls passed away on January 6, 2006, in Los Angeles, leaving a lasting legacy as one of soul music’s most distinctive and enduring voices.
