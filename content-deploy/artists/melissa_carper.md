## Biography
Melissa Carper, an American singer, songwriter, and double bassist, was raised in North Platte and Lincoln, Nebraska, in a musical family. She began playing upright bass in fourth grade through her public school music program and performed in her family's traveling country band, led by her mother, at venues like Elks Lodges, VFWs, churches, and rest homes, covering classics alongside 1980s country. Influenced early by her father's gift of Jimmie Rodgers recordings and her parents' record collection featuring Hank Williams, Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, Ray Charles, and Elvis Presley, Carper earned a classical music scholarship to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Drawn to jazz vocalists like Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald, Frank Sinatra, and blues artist Lead Belly discovered in the university library, she left college without a degree to pursue gigging.[1][2][3][4][6]

Carper honed her craft busking in Eureka Springs, Arkansas—a cultural hub in the Ozarks where she felt comfortable in the gay community—followed by stints in New Orleans (busking on Royal Street), New York, Alaska (working at a fish factory), Austin, Texas (2009), and Nashville, Tennessee (2014). Her style blends old-time country, bluegrass, western swing, jazz, blues, R&B, and soul, evoking a 'voice from a bygone era' with profoundly observational lyrics and a smoky croon. She founded and performed with bands like The Carper Family (power trio, 2010s, award-winning debut 'Back When'), Sad Daddy (Arkansas foursome), Buffalo Gals (duo with partner Rebecca Patek), Camptown Ladies, and Wonder Women of Country (EP with Kelly Willis and Brennen Leigh, 2024). Her solo debut *Daddy’s Country Gold* (2021, produced after meeting Dennis Crouch in Nashville) highlighted classic country and western swing; *Ramblin' Soul* (2022, praised by Rolling Stone) and *Borned in Ya* (2024, Thirty Tigers) expanded her acclaim.[1][2][3][4][5][6][8]

Now based in Austin, Texas, Carper is a musical traditionalist for the modern age, channeling everyday life's beauty, struggles, and humor into unapologetically queer-informed songs. Her humanitarian efforts include developing the Natural State of Being Farm in Arkansas to combat homelessness and support recovery. With over 30 years in music, recent 2025 collaborative releases underscore her mastery and deep artist connections.[2][4][9]
