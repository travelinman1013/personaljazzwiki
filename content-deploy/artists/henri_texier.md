# Henri Texier

## Biography
Henri Texier, born on January 27, 1945, in Paris, France, began his musical journey at age 15 playing piano in nightclubs before switching to double bass at 16, becoming largely self-taught and deeply influenced by bassist Wilbur Ware. From modest beginnings, he quickly immersed himself in the Parisian jazz scene, forming one of France's earliest free jazz groups in 1965 with Georges Locatelli, Alain Tabar-Nouval, Jean-Max Albert, and Klaus Hagel, inspired by Don Cherry and Ornette Coleman. By the late 1960s, Texier joined Jef Gilson's big band, meeting drummer Daniel Humair, and together they backed American jazz luminaries like Bud Powell, Donald Byrd, Phil Woods, Dexter Gordon, and Chet Baker, solidifying their reputation as a formidable rhythm section.[1][3][5]

Texier's career flourished in the late 1960s and 1970s as a member of Phil Woods' European Rhythm Machine (1968-1972) alongside George Gruntz, Gordon Beck, and Daniel Humair, while also performing with artists like John Abercrombie and Didier Lockwood. In the 1970s, he expanded his instrumental palette to include oud, flute, cello, and percussion, developing his singing voice during a period of experimentation. From 1982, he formed key ensembles like a quartet and the acclaimed trio with Louis Sclavis and Aldo Romano, releasing Africa-themed albums such as Carnet de routes, Suite africaine, and African Flashback on Label Bleu, which became his primary label. North African motifs increasingly shaped his work from the mid-1990s, including tours with his trio accompanying the 1970 Algerian film Remparts d’Argile, and collaborations with Breton jazz musicians.[1][2][3]

Texier's musical style blends a physical, 'bell-like' bass tone with influences from hard bop and free jazz, pioneering a distinctly French jazz identity independent of American models. His son Sébastien Texier joined his groups in the early 1990s on reeds, contributing to projects like the Strada Sextet. Honored as a Chevalier of the Ordre National de la Légion d’Honneur in 2001, Texier has recorded over 20 albums as a leader and more than 100 in total, remaining active into recent decades with quintets and innovative works.[1][2][5]

## Fun Facts
- Texier formed one of France's first free jazz groups in 1965, despite almost no recordings surviving.
- In the 1970s, he became a one-man band on albums like Amir and Varech, using a Revox tape recorder for multi-tracking as an ex-hippie experimenter.
- Received the Chevalier of the Ordre National de la Légion d’Honneur in June 2001, France's highest artistic honor.
- His trio toured Europe accompanying the nearly silent 1970 Algerian film Remparts d’Argile starting in 2001.
