## Biography
Chrissie Hynde, renowned as the founder and lead vocalist of The Pretenders, has been a pioneering figure in rock music since the late 1970s. Born in Akron, Ohio, in 1951, Hynde moved to London in the early 1970s, immersing herself in the burgeoning punk scene and eventually forming The Pretenders in 1978. Her distinctive voice, songwriting, and guitar work propelled the band to international acclaim, with hits like 'Brass in Pocket' and 'Back on the Chain Gang.' Hynde's career has been marked by collaborations with a wide range of artists, reflecting her versatility and enduring influence in the music world.[1][2][4]

In 2004, Hynde expanded her musical horizons by moving to São Paulo, Brazil, where she collaborated with acclaimed Brazilian musicians Moreno Veloso, Alexandre Kassin, and Domenico Lancellotti. This partnership blended Hynde's rock sensibilities with the innovative sounds of Brazil's contemporary music scene, resulting in a unique fusion of styles. The collaboration was significant enough for Hynde to describe the resulting album as 'awesome,' highlighting the creative synergy among the artists.[2][5]

Moreno Veloso, son of legendary Brazilian musician Caetano Veloso, is known for his sophisticated approach to MPB (Música Popular Brasileira), often working with Kassin and Domenico as the trio '+2.' Together, their work with Hynde represents a cross-cultural exchange that bridges Anglo-American rock and Brazilian pop, enriching both traditions and showcasing the global reach of modern music.[5][6]
