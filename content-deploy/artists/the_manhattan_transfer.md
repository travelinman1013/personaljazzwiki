## Biography
The Manhattan Transfer is an acclaimed American vocal group formed in 1969 in New York City by Tim Hauser, initially with Erin Dickins, Marty Nelson, Pat Rosalia, and Gene Pistilli. Their early work, including the album 'Jukin'' (1971), explored jazz, rock, and country, but the original lineup disbanded in 1973 due to artistic differences. The group was reborn in 1972 when Hauser, while working as a New York cab driver, met Laurel Massé and later Janis Siegel and Alan Paul, forming the classic quartet that would define their sound and legacy. 

The Manhattan Transfer became known for their innovative blend of vocal jazz, a cappella, swing, vocalese, pop, and rhythm and blues. Their 1975 self-titled album marked a shift toward sophisticated vocal jazz, featuring hits like 'Operator' and 'Java Jive.' The group achieved international success, especially in Europe, with albums like 'Coming Out' and 'Pastiche.' After Massé's departure in 1978, Cheryl Bentyne joined, and the group continued to evolve, winning their first Grammy for 'Birdland' in 1980. Over the decades, they amassed eleven Grammy Awards, including a historic win in both pop and jazz categories in the same year (1981), and became one of the most influential vocal groups in modern music. 

The Manhattan Transfer's musical style is characterized by complex harmonies, inventive arrangements, and a seamless fusion of genres. Their legacy includes not only chart-topping hits and critical acclaim but also a profound influence on vocal jazz and popular music. The group officially retired in 2023, leaving behind a vast discography and a reputation as pioneers of vocal harmony and genre-crossing artistry.
