## Biography
“Jake Shimabukuro & Mick Fleetwood” refers to the high‑profile collaboration between Hawaiian ukulele virtuoso Jake Shimabukuro and British drummer Mick Fleetwood, co‑founder of Fleetwood Mac, on the project *Blues Experience*. The partnership grew out of Shimabukuro’s long‑standing admiration for Fleetwood Mac and Fleetwood’s foundational role in British blues‑rock. Jake first met Mick after a Fleetwood Mac concert in Nashville, where he was invited backstage; a later reconnection on Maui—where Fleetwood has long maintained a home—led to serious discussions about recording together.[1][2] They eventually booked studio time at Fleetwood’s home studio in Kula, Maui, deciding to enter the sessions with only a loose plan and a shared love of the blues, letting improvisation and chemistry shape the music.[1][2]

Their album *Blues Experience* (released October 18) is a mostly instrumental set that reimagines classic blues and rock repertoire through the unusual pairing of ukulele and Fleetwood’s deeply rooted blues shuffle feel.[1] The record includes interpretations of Muddy Waters’ “Rollin’ and Tumblin’,” Little Willie John’s “Need Your Love So Bad” (also a Peter Green‑era Fleetwood Mac staple), Albert King’s “I Wanna Get Funky,” Gary Moore’s “Still Got the Blues,” Stevie Wonder’s “Cause We’ve Ended as Lovers,” and Neil Young’s “Rockin’ in the Free World,” alongside a powerful version of Christine McVie’s Fleetwood Mac ballad “Songbird.”[1][2] Tracking was done largely live with a small band, emphasizing interaction and spontaneity rather than heavy overdubbing.[1][2] Their collaboration fuses Shimabukuro’s virtuosic, effects‑friendly ukulele style—shaped by rock and fusion guitar heroes—with Fleetwood’s decades‑deep grounding in electric blues and classic rock, creating a distinctive cross‑generational, cross‑cultural take on blues that adds a new chapter to both artists’ legacies.[1][2][4]

The project also underscores Maui’s role as a creative hub for both musicians. Fleetwood, a longtime Maui resident and local arts supporter, offered his personal studio and community of players for the sessions, while Shimabukuro brought his core live band and his history of bridging Hawaiian tradition with global genres.[1][2][4] Critics and interviewers have highlighted *Blues Experience* as an unexpected yet natural meeting point between British blues history and contemporary Hawaiian innovation, with special attention to the emotional weight of “Songbird,” recorded in a single, highly intuitive take that Fleetwood described as feeling like the presence of Christine McVie was in the room.[1] Though not a standing band in the conventional sense, “Jake Shimabukuro & Mick Fleetwood” represents an ongoing musical relationship centered on shared respect, exploratory live recording, and a mutual desire to stretch the expressive possibilities of their primary instruments within the blues idiom.[1][2][3][4]

## Fun Facts
- The first seeds of the collaboration were planted backstage at a Fleetwood Mac reunion concert in Nashville, where Mick Fleetwood invited Jake Shimabukuro to hang after the show and casually floated the idea of working together someday.[1][2]
- The sessions for *Blues Experience* took place at Mick Fleetwood’s home studio in the Kula region of Maui, reflecting Fleetwood’s deep ties to the island community where he has lived for years and previously operated a namesake restaurant in Lahaina.[1][2][4]
- Their version of Christine McVie’s “Songbird” was recorded in a single, highly emotional take; after the final note, Fleetwood told the band he felt Christine’s presence in the studio, and the musicians sat in powerful silence before anyone spoke.[1]
- Jake and Mick’s hard‑hitting rendition of Neil Young’s “Rockin’ in the Free World” was originally cut for a Neil Young tribute album, but Shimabukuro liked the track so much he requested and received permission to also include it on *Blues Experience*.[1][2]
