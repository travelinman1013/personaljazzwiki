## Biography
Guilhem Flouzat is a French drummer, composer, and songwriter whose career bridges the jazz scenes of Europe and the United States. Born in Paris and the grandson of renowned pianist and organist Henriette Puig-Roget, Flouzat was immersed in music from an early age, influenced by the classical works of Ravel and Poulenc. He initially established himself as a sought-after sideman in Paris before relocating to New York, where he spent seven formative years refining his craft and musical identity.

In New York, Flouzat studied with acclaimed drummers such as Eric Harland, Dan Weiss, Mark Guiliana, and John Riley, experiences that deeply shaped his rhythmic approach and compositional voice. He collaborated with leading jazz artists including Lionel Loueke, Becca Stevens, Steve Wilson, Dave Liebman, Linda Oh, and Gilad Hekselman. Flouzat’s music is noted for its narrative depth, blending cool jazz with influences from both the European classical tradition and the American jazz canon. His trio, often featuring pianist Sullivan Fortner and bassist Desmond White, is celebrated for its sophisticated interpretations of standards, as heard on the album 'A Thing Called Joe,' which has drawn comparisons to classic Prestige Records trio sessions.

Over the past decade, Flouzat has maintained a dual presence on the European and American jazz scenes, working as a leader and sideman with artists such as Youn Sun Nah, Camila Meza, and Seamus Blake. His discography includes the acclaimed debut 'One Way…Or Another,' the portrait-driven 'Portraits,' and the collaborative 'Constant Stranger.' Flouzat’s work is characterized by its lyrical sensibility, inventive arrangements, and a commitment to both tradition and innovation, securing his reputation as a distinctive voice in contemporary jazz.
