## Biography
Tony Bennett, born Anthony Dominick Benedetto on August 3, 1926, in the Astoria section of Queens, New York, became one of the most celebrated singers of the 20th and 21st centuries.[1][6] His path to stardom began unexpectedly in 1949 when comedian Bob Hope discovered him performing with Pearl Bailey in Greenwich Village. Hope was so impressed that he invited Bennett to perform at the Paramount Theatre in New York City and subsequently shortened his stage name from the unmemorable "Joe Bari" to "Tony Bennett," reasoning that "Anthony Benedetto" was too long to fit on a marquee.[3] Before his entertainment career took off, Bennett served three years in the U.S. Army during World War II, including combat service with the 63rd Infantry Division during the Battle of the Bulge, an experience he would later describe as having a "front-row seat in hell."[1]

Bennett's recording career officially launched in 1950 when he signed with Columbia Records under producer Mitch Miller, immediately achieving commercial success with his debut hit "Boulevard of Broken Dreams."[1][3] His early 1950s recordings produced a string of chart-toppers including "Because of You" (which reached number one and stayed there for ten weeks), "Cold, Cold Heart," "Rags to Riches," and "Stranger in Paradise."[3][6] A pivotal moment came in 1962 with the release of "I Left My Heart in San Francisco," originally recorded as a B-side, which became his signature song and earned him his first Grammy Awards for Best Record of the Year and Best Male Solo Vocal Performance.[2] Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, pianist and arranger Ralph Sharon became instrumental in Bennett's artistic development, encouraging him to embrace his jazz inclinations rather than remain confined to commercial pop standards.[1]

Bennett's career experienced a significant decline in the 1970s after he left Columbia Records to found his own label, Improv, with Bill Hassett.[4] Though he recorded critically acclaimed work including *The Tony Bennett/Bill Evans Album* (1975) and *Together Again* (1976), commercial success eluded him, and the label eventually folded, leaving him in debt and struggling with IRS issues.[1][4] His remarkable career revival began in 1986 when he re-signed with Columbia Records and released *The Art of Excellence*, facilitated largely by his son Danny Bennett, who became his personal manager and orchestrated an aggressive campaign to market his father to younger audiences through college and theater performances.[3][4] This resurgence proved extraordinarily successful, with Bennett winning 19 Grammy Awards throughout his lifetime, including eight for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album, a 1995 Grammy for Record of the Year for his *MTV Unplugged* live recording, and the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2001.[2][5] Despite being diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 2016, Bennett continued performing until his retirement in 2021, maintaining an unprecedented career spanning over seven decades until his death on July 21, 2023, at age 96.[4]

## Fun Facts
- Frank Sinatra, one of Bennett's contemporaries, called him 'the best singer in the business,' a remarkable compliment from one of the era's greatest vocalists.[6]
- Bennett's stage name was created by Bob Hope, who felt that both his birth name 'Anthony Benedetto' was too long to fit on a marquee and his then-current stage name 'Joe Bari' was unmemorable, leading Hope to christen him 'Tony Bennett' on the spot.[3]
- Despite being diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 2016, Bennett continued to perform and record music, demonstrating remarkable resilience and dedication to his craft until his retirement in 2021.[4]
- Bennett's 1995 MTV Unplugged live recording won the Grammy Award for Record of the Year and introduced this American master to an entirely new generation of music fans, revitalizing his career in his later years.[2][5]
