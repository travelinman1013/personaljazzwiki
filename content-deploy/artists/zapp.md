## Biography
Zapp is an American funk band that originated in Dayton, Ohio, in 1977, founded by the Troutman family—primarily brothers Roger, Larry, Lester, and Terry Troutman. The group’s roots trace back to the early 1960s as Lil Roger and Lil Lester, evolving through several incarnations before settling on the name Zapp in the late 1970s. Their breakthrough came in 1980 with the release of their self-titled debut album, produced by Bootsy Collins and released on Warner Bros. Records. The album featured the iconic single 'More Bounce to the Ounce,' which became a platinum hit and established Zapp as a force in the funk and post-disco scenes[1][3].

Zapp’s signature sound is defined by Roger Troutman’s innovative use of the talk-box, a device that allowed him to manipulate his voice through a synthesizer, creating a robotic, futuristic effect. This unique style, combined with infectious grooves and danceable rhythms, made Zapp pioneers of the electro-funk subgenre. Throughout the 1980s, the band released a string of successful albums, including 'Zapp II' and 'Zapp III,' and their music became a staple in dance clubs and on R&B charts. The group’s influence extended into the 1990s, as their tracks were heavily sampled in West Coast hip-hop, particularly in the G-funk movement led by Dr. Dre[2][3].

Despite facing tragedy with the death of Roger Troutman in 1999, Zapp’s legacy endures through their enduring catalog and ongoing performances by surviving members. Their innovative approach to funk and their widespread influence on hip-hop and modern R&B have secured Zapp’s place as one of the most important and influential bands in the history of funk music[2][3].
