## Biography
Hiromi's Sonicbloom is a dynamic jazz fusion group formed in 2006 by acclaimed Japanese pianist and composer Hiromi Uehara. Born in Hamamatsu, Japan, in 1979, Hiromi began piano lessons at age six and was introduced to jazz by her teacher Noriko Hikida at eight. By her early teens, she was performing with major orchestras, including a notable appearance with the Czech Philharmonic at age 14. After a chance meeting and performance with Chick Corea at 17, Hiromi attended Berklee College of Music in Boston, where she was mentored by jazz legend Ahmad Jamal and quickly established herself as a prodigious talent.

Hiromi's Sonicbloom brought together bassist Tony Grey, drummer Martin Valihora, and guitarist David Fiuczynski, blending jazz, classical, fusion, and rock influences into a high-energy, virtuosic sound. The group released two major albums: 'Time Control' (2007) and 'Beyond Standard' (2008), the latter featuring innovative reinterpretations of jazz and rock standards. Hiromi's Sonicbloom was celebrated for its technical prowess, genre-defying arrangements, and electrifying live performances, earning recognition from leading jazz publications and appearances at major festivals worldwide. The group represents a pivotal chapter in Hiromi's career, expanding her musical language and global reach.
