## Biography
Neill Kirby McMillan Jr., professionally known as Mojo Nixon, was born on August 2, 1957, in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. He burst onto the music scene in the early 1980s in San Diego, where he partnered with Skid Roper to create a distinctive blend of rockabilly, punk, and country that he dubbed "psychobilly." Nixon and Roper released their debut album in 1985 on Enigma Records, establishing themselves as provocative satirists of contemporary culture. Their third album, 1987's *Bo-Day-Shus!!!*, featured "Elvis Is Everywhere," a deification of Elvis Presley that became Nixon's signature song and an alternative staple on MTV, cementing his status as a cult icon.

Throughout the late 1980s, Nixon and Roper produced satirical pieces lampooning celebrities and American culture, including controversial songs like "Debbie Gibson Is Pregnant with My Two-Headed Love Child" and "Don Henley Must Die." After parting ways with Roper in late 1989, Nixon pursued a solo career, releasing *Otis* in 1990. When Enigma Records went bankrupt shortly after, much of his early catalog fell into legal limbo. During the 1990s, Nixon continued recording with various backup bands, most notably the Toadliquors, while also collaborating with notable artists including Jello Biafra and members of the Beat Farmers. He appeared in several films and voiced characters in video games, including *Redneck Rampage* (1997).

Nixon's later career saw him announce an "unretirement" in October 2009 with the release of *Whiskey Rebellion*, a collection of previously unreleased tracks. He also hosted *The Loon in the Afternoon* radio show on Sirius XM's Outlaw Country channel. Nixon passed away on February 7, 2024, leaving behind a legacy as a provocative psychobilly pioneer who blended musical genres with irreverent humor and social commentary.

## Fun Facts
- Nixon's personal religious trinity consisted of Elvis Presley, Foghorn Leghorn (the cartoon character), and Otis Campbell (a character from The Andy Griffith Show), reflecting his unique blend of pop culture reverence and absurdist humor.
- He voiced Sheriff Lester T. Hobbes in the 1997 computer game *Redneck Rampage*, which featured a licensed psychobilly soundtrack including two of his songs and a promotional music video.
- In 2009, Nixon announced his "unretirement" by claiming he found previously unreleased tracks in "an old shoe box full of cassette tapes" under his front porch, which became the album *Whiskey Rebellion*.
- MTV severed ties with Nixon after the network refused to air the video for "Debbie Gibson Is Pregnant with My Two-Headed Love Child," demonstrating the controversial nature of his satirical approach to pop culture commentary.
