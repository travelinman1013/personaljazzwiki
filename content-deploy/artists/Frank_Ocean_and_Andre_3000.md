## Biography
Frank Ocean and André 3000 are two of the most influential and enigmatic figures in contemporary music, each celebrated for their innovation and artistry. Frank Ocean, born Christopher Edwin Breaux in Long Beach, California, rose to prominence in the early 2010s with his evocative songwriting and genre-defying sound, particularly through his acclaimed debut album 'Channel Orange' (2012). Ocean is known for blending R&B, soul, and pop with deeply personal and poetic lyrics, and for his reclusive, auteur-like approach to music-making.

André 3000, born André Lauren Benjamin in Atlanta, Georgia, is best known as one half of the legendary hip-hop duo Outkast. Renowned for his inventive lyricism, genre-blurring production, and charismatic performances, André 3000 helped redefine Southern hip-hop and mainstream rap throughout the 1990s and 2000s. After Outkast's hiatus, André became a sought-after collaborator, lending his distinctive voice and perspective to select projects, including Frank Ocean's work.

The two artists first collaborated on 'Pink Matter' from Ocean's 'Channel Orange,' where André delivered a reflective verse and played guitar, followed by a striking appearance on 'Solo (Reprise)' from Ocean's 2016 album 'Blonde.' Their collaborations are lauded for their introspective lyricism and boundary-pushing musicality, cementing their legacy as icons who continually inspire new generations of artists.
