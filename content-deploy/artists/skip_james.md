## Biography
Nehemiah Curtis "Skip" James was born on June 9, 1902, on the Whitehead Plantation near Bentonia, Mississippi. His early life was marked by musical exposure, with his father being a blues guitarist and his mother arranging for him to study piano. James began learning guitar in 1917 under the influence of Henry Stuckey, adopting a unique open D-minor tuning and a haunting falsetto voice. In 1931, James recorded eighteen songs for Paramount Records, including "Devil Got My Woman" and "Hard Time Killing Floor Blues," but these sold poorly during the Great Depression. He then became a Baptist minister and gospel singer, returning to blues in the 1960s after being rediscovered by enthusiasts like John Fahey. James's music is characterized by its dark, minor-key sound and intricate fingerpicking technique, influencing generations of musicians. Despite his late recognition, James's legacy as a seminal blues figure is profound, with his songs being covered by artists like Cream and Rory Block. He passed away on October 3, 1969, in Philadelphia, and was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1992.
