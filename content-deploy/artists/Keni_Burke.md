## Biography
Keni Burke, born Kenneth M. Burke on September 28, 1953, in Chicago, Illinois, is an American R&B, soul, funk, and jazz singer, songwriter, record producer, and multi-instrumentalist[6]. He first gained prominence as the youngest member of the Five Stairsteps, a family soul group best known for their 1970 hit "O-o-h Child," which sold over a million copies[1][6]. Burke wrote the group's first minor hit, "You Waited Too Long," in 1966, and later penned their 1976 hit "From Us to You" after the group signed with George Harrison's Dark Horse Records[1][6]. After the Five Stairsteps disbanded, Burke continued as a session musician for Dark Horse, contributing instrumentation for a diverse array of artists while launching his solo career[1][6].

Burke's solo work is characterized by smooth, post-disco grooves, sophisticated arrangements, and his distinctive bass playing. His 1982 album Changes featured the signature hit "Risin' to the Top," which became a Chicago favorite and a widely sampled track in hip hop[1][6]. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Burke remained active as a session player and producer, working with major R&B and soul acts. His 1998 album Nothin' but Love included the UK hit "Indigenous Love." Burke's legacy lies in his seamless blend of soul, funk, and jazz, his influential bass lines, and his enduring impact on both R&B and hip hop music[1][6].
