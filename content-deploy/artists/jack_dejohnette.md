## Biography
Jack DeJohnette (August 9, 1942 – October 26, 2025) was a pioneering American jazz drummer, pianist, and composer, widely celebrated for his versatility and innovation across jazz, jazz fusion, and free jazz. Born in Chicago, DeJohnette began studying piano at the age of four, later attending the Chicago Conservatory of Music. His early exposure to both piano and drums shaped his unique approach to rhythm and harmony, and by high school he was already performing with local groups and leading his own bands[1][5].

DeJohnette's career took off in the 1960s as he became a sought-after musician in Chicago's vibrant jazz scene, playing with future AACM members and collaborating with avant-garde and hard bop groups. After moving to New York in 1966, he gained national recognition as a member of the Charles Lloyd Quartet, alongside pianist Keith Jarrett. DeJohnette's groundbreaking work with Miles Davis, particularly on the seminal album 'Bitches Brew,' helped redefine the boundaries of jazz fusion. Over his six-decade career, he recorded extensively as both a leader and sideman, working with luminaries such as Bill Evans, John Abercrombie, Alice Coltrane, Herbie Hancock, and Pat Metheny[2][4].

Known for his improvisational brilliance and genre-defying style, DeJohnette's drumming blended jazz, rock, world music, and avant-garde elements, making him a central figure in modern jazz. He won two Grammy Awards, was inducted into the Modern Drummer Hall of Fame, and influenced generations of musicians through his innovative techniques and collaborative spirit. His legacy endures as one of jazz's most creative and influential artists[2][6].
