## Biography
Silver Synthetic is a neo‑psychedelic, guitar‑driven rock band from New Orleans, Louisiana, formed in 2017 by singer‑guitarist Chris Lyons after a run fronting local garage‑punk outfit Bottomfeeders.[1][2][3] Lyons began the project when he found himself with a batch of songs that leaned away from punk toward tuneful, 1970s‑inflected rock and country‑rock, prompting him to assemble a new group to realize this more melodic vision.[1][2] The initial lineup drew on the tight‑knit New Orleans rock scene, bringing in musicians with backgrounds in bands such as Bottomfeeders and Nashville‑via‑New‑Orleans rock duo JEFF the Brotherhood, helping Silver Synthetic quickly develop into a cohesive four‑piece steeped in classic songcraft.[3]

Musically, Silver Synthetic fuse jangling guitars, close harmonies, and a laid‑back rhythmic swing, drawing heavily on 1970s pop, psych, and country‑rock while maintaining the immediacy of modern indie rock.[3][4] Critics have compared their sound to acts like the Kinks and other vintage British and American guitar bands, noting the blend of bluesy, catchy melodies and wistful, reflective lyrics across their self‑titled debut album, released in 2021.[3][4] Subsequent work has pushed further into what one critic called a “beatific union of cosmic Americana and harmonious guitar grooves,” reinforcing the band’s reputation for warm, analog‑leaning production and carefully arranged twin‑guitar interplay.[6] Although still relatively early in their career, Silver Synthetic have carved out a niche within contemporary neo‑psych and Americana, standing out for their combination of concise songwriting, classic influences, and the distinct musical character of their New Orleans roots.[3][6]

## Fun Facts
- Silver Synthetic began when frontman Chris Lyons realized a new batch of songs he had written no longer fit the aggressive, garage‑punk sound of his existing band Bottomfeeders, prompting him to start a separate project.[1][2]
- The band’s music is frequently described as a modern take on 1970s pop and country‑rock, with critics emphasizing how their self‑titled debut channels that era’s melodic focus and analog warmth.[3][4]
- Reviewers have highlighted Silver Synthetic’s blend of neo‑psychedelia and what one called a “beatific union of cosmic Americana and harmonious guitar grooves,” setting them apart from heavier or more experimental psych‑rock acts.[6]
- Although rooted in New Orleans—a city often associated with jazz, funk, and brass bands—Silver Synthetic instead draw their primary inspiration from classic guitar‑rock traditions, giving their take on neo‑psych a distinctive regional contrast.[1][3][6]
