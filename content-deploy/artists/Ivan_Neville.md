## Biography
Ivan Neville, born August 19, 1959, in New Orleans, Louisiana, USA, is a celebrated multi-instrumentalist, singer, and songwriter deeply rooted in the city’s musical heritage[2]. Growing up in the legendary Neville family, he was immersed in music from birth, absorbing the sounds of his father Aaron Neville, uncles Art, Charles, and Cyril Neville, and the pioneering funk of [[01_Projects/PersonalArtistWiki/Artists/The_Meters]][1][4]. By high school, Ivan was already performing in local talent shows and soon joined the Neville Brothers, contributing keyboards, percussion, and vocals to their early albums and learning from these masters of New Orleans music[1].

Ivan's career took off in the mid-1980s when he became a sought-after sideman, performing with Bonnie Raitt (1985–1987), contributing to her album *Nine Lives*, and playing keyboards on Rolling Stones albums *Dirty Work* (1986) and *Voodoo Lounge* (1994)[2]. He released his debut solo album, *If My Ancestors Could See Me Now*, in 1988, scoring a Top 30 Billboard hit with "Not Just Another Girl"[2][3]. A frequent collaborator with Keith Richards, Ivan was a member of the X-Pensive Winos, touring and recording with Richards in the late 1980s and early 1990s[1][2]. In 2003, he co-founded Dumpstaphunk, a powerhouse New Orleans funk band that has become a staple at major festivals worldwide[3][4]. Ivan's musical style blends New Orleans funk, R&B, soul, and rock, with a distinctive keyboard prowess that channels influences from Professor Longhair, [[01_Projects/PersonalArtistWiki/Artists/James_Booker]], and [[01_Projects/PersonalArtistWiki/Artists/Dr._John]][4]. His legacy is marked by both his solo work and his role as a standard-bearer for New Orleans’ musical culture, bridging generations and genres with grace and grit[4].
