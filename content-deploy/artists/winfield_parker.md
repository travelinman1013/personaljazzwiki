## Biography
Winfield Albert Parker (June 21, 1942 – January 18, 2021) was an American soul and gospel singer-songwriter and saxophonist, born in Cooksville, Maryland and later based in Baltimore[2][3][4]. Initially drawn to music as a saxophonist rather than a vocalist, Parker began playing the instrument at age sixteen and joined his first group, the Veejays, during his time at Harriet Tubman High School[1]. His early career saw him performing with Sammy Fitzhugh & the Moroccans and recording his first singles in New York, before joining Little Richard’s band as the youngest member—a formative experience that exposed him to the wider world of professional touring and recording[1][4].

Parker’s reputation grew throughout the 1960s and 1970s as he transitioned from instrumentalist to frontman, recording for labels such as Ru-Jac and Arctic Records and developing a style rooted in northern soul and Philly soul[2][3]. He collaborated with Richard Dunbar as part of the Knight Brothers and later shifted focus to gospel music, especially after personal legal troubles led to a spiritual awakening and his ordination as a minister in 1981[1]. His gospel recordings, including "I’ve Come A Long Way" with Milt Matthews, marked a new chapter in his career, blending his soulful roots with spiritual themes and earning him recognition in the gospel community[1].

Parker’s legacy is defined by his versatility as both a saxophonist and singer, his contributions to the Baltimore soul scene, and his ability to bridge secular and sacred music. His work influenced the development of regional soul styles and left a lasting mark on both R&B and gospel traditions[2][4].
