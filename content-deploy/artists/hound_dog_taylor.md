## Biography
Theodore Roosevelt "Hound Dog" Taylor was born on April 12, 1915, in Natchez, Mississippi, though some sources cite 1917 as his birth year. He began his musical journey on the piano before switching to guitar at age 20, playing in Delta juke joints while working as a sharecropper. In 1942, Taylor moved to Chicago, immersing himself in the city's vibrant blues scene and developing his signature electrified slide guitar style, which was raw, exuberant, and deeply rooted in the traditions of the South Side clubs.

Taylor's career took a pivotal turn in 1970 when Bruce Iglauer, inspired by Taylor's energetic performances with his band the HouseRockers (Brewer Phillips on second guitar and Ted Harvey on drums), founded Alligator Records specifically to record Taylor. Their debut album, "Hound Dog Taylor and the HouseRockers" (1971), was recorded in just two nights and became the first release for the now-legendary blues label. Taylor's subsequent albums, including "Natural Boogie" (1974) and the posthumous "Beware of the Dog!" (1976), showcased his raucous, joyful approach to the blues and brought him national and international acclaim. He toured widely, sharing stages with blues greats like Muddy Waters, Freddie King, and Big Mama Thornton.

Taylor died of lung cancer in 1975, but his legacy endures. He was posthumously inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1984, and his influence on slide guitarists and blues musicians remains profound. His music, characterized by its "wild, raucous, crazy" energy, continues to inspire artists and fans alike, cementing his place as a beloved icon of classic Chicago blues.
