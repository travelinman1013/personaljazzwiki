## Biography
Clarence "Frogman" Henry was born on March 19, 1937, in New Orleans, Louisiana. He began taking piano lessons at a young age, influenced by Fats Domino and Professor Longhair. Henry's musical career started in the early 1950s when he joined Bobby Mitchell's band. In 1955, he joined Eddie Smith & His Chiefs, and later collaborated with bandleader Paul Gayten. His breakthrough came with the 1956 hit "Ain't Got No Home," which earned him the nickname "Frogman" due to his unique vocal style, featuring both falsetto and a raspy, frog-like croak. This song reached number 20 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number three on the R&B charts. Henry continued to have success with hits like "But I Do" and "You Always Hurt the One You Love," both produced by Allen Toussaint. He opened for the Beatles in 1964 and was inducted into the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame in 2007. Henry passed away on April 7, 2024, at the age of 87, leaving behind a legacy as one of New Orleans' most beloved musical figures.
