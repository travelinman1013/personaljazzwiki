## Biography
Garotas Suecas is a Brazilian band formed in 2005 in São Paulo, emerging from the city’s independent rock circuit with a sound that quickly stood out for its blend of rock, funk, soul and Brazilian music.[1][2] In their early years they condensed these influences into a series of EPs — *Hey, Hey, Hey, São os Garotas Suecas* (2006), *Difícil de Domar* (2008) and *Dinossauros* (2009) — which showcased an energetic stage presence and inventive visuals, earning them a nomination for MTV Brasil’s Revelação (Best New Artist) award in 2009 and a VMB prize for the “Difícil de Domar” video in 2008.[1][2] Their debut album *Escaldante Banda* expanded their audience in Brazil and abroad, leading to performances at major festivals such as South by Southwest (Austin), Primavera Sound (Barcelona), Bumbershoot (Seattle) and Pirenéus Sul (Spain), and coverage in outlets like The New York Times, The Washington Post, El País and BLITZ praising their contagious live show.[1]

Musically, Garotas Suecas fuse 1960s and 1970s American soul and funk with garage rock, psychedelia and classic Música Popular Brasileira, often evoking the Tropicalista spirit and São Paulo’s tradition of experimental pop.[1][3][4] *Escaldante Banda* was independently released in Brazil yet named one of the ten best albums of 2010 by Rolling Stone Brasil and nominated for the 7th Prêmio Bravo! Prime de Cultura for Best Popular CD, cementing their reputation on the national scene.[1] Their second album *Feras Míticas*, produced by British producer Nick Graham‑Smith and recorded at Pendulum Studio in São Paulo, presented a more solid and introspective sound while still grounded in soul and rock, and featured guest appearances by rapper Lurdez da Luz, Titãs’ Paulo Miklos and American guitarist Kid Congo Powers.[1] After original vocalist Guilherme Saldanha left in 2014, the band reorganized around a more collective approach to vocals and songwriting, inaugurated on the 2015 EP *Mal Educado*, and continued to refine their mix of soul, funk, garage rock and Brazilian rhythms on later releases such as *Futuro do Pretérito* (2017) and the album *1 2 3 4*, which critics have described as an important statement within Brazil’s independent scene.[1][2][6][8]

Over nearly two decades, Garotas Suecas have become one of the key agents in consolidating the contemporary Brazilian independent rock and new MPB scene, balancing reverence for classic soul and 1960s/70s psychedelia with socially aware lyrics and urban chronicles of São Paulo life.[6][8] Their commitment to strong visual concepts, adventurous arrangements and collaborative songwriting has allowed them to navigate line‑up changes while maintaining a recognizable identity and influencing younger bands attracted to their synthesis of vintage black music, Brazilian grooves and garage‑rock energy.[1][3][6]
