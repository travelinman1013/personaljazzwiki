## Biography
Flea, born Michael Peter Balzary on October 16, 1962, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, is an Australian‑American bassist, musician, actor, and author best known as the co‑founder and bassist of Red Hot Chili Peppers.[1][2] His parents divorced when he was very young, and the family moved first to New York City and later to Los Angeles, where his mother married jazz musician Walter Urban Jr., immersing Flea in jazz and improvised music from childhood.[1][2] He initially played trumpet and performed in settings such as the Los Angeles Junior Philharmonic Orchestra, idolizing jazz greats like Dizzy Gillespie and Miles Davis before ever touching the bass guitar.[1][2] At Fairfax High School in Los Angeles he became close friends with Anthony Kiedis and met future bandmates Hillel Slovak and Jack Irons, first joining their rock band Anthym on bass despite having no prior experience with the instrument.[1][2][3]

In 1983 Flea, Kiedis, Slovak, and Irons formed Tony Flow and the Miraculously Majestic Masters of Mayhem, quickly renamed Red Hot Chili Peppers, fusing funk, punk, and psychedelic rock into an energetic, groove‑driven sound anchored by Flea’s inventive bass playing.[1] Early albums such as *Freaky Styley* (1985), produced by funk pioneer George Clinton, showcased his aggressive slap technique and funk‑punk attack, while the band’s later commercial breakthroughs like *Blood Sugar Sex Magik* (1991) and *Californication* (1999) reflected his evolution toward more melodic, song‑oriented lines.[1] Flea’s style draws heavily on funk and jazz traditions—slap riffs, syncopated grooves, and occasional lyrical trumpet work—yet also channels the raw minimalism of punk, making him one of modern rock’s most recognizable bass voices.[1] Beyond his primary work with Red Hot Chili Peppers, he has appeared as a session and touring musician, actor in films such as *My Own Private Idaho*, and advocate for music education, reinforcing a legacy as both a boundary‑pushing bassist and a cultural figure whose playing has helped redefine the role of bass in mainstream rock.[1][2]

## Fun Facts
- Flea’s first main instrument was the trumpet, and he played with the Los Angeles Junior Philharmonic Orchestra before he ever picked up a bass guitar.[2]
- He only began playing bass around age 17, when Hillel Slovak asked him to join their band Anthym; within months he had developed the distinctive style that would later make him famous.[2][3]
- His nickname “Flea” dates back to high school, where friends jokingly gave each other cartoon‑style names and his hyperactive personality inspired the moniker.[2]
- Flea was close friends with actor River Phoenix and was in the ambulance with him the night Phoenix died; he had also recorded with Phoenix’s band Aleka’s Attic on the track “Note to a Friend.”[2]

## Musical Connections

### Mentors/Influences
- [[walter_urban_jr|Walter Urban Jr.]] - Stepfather and jazz musician who exposed Flea to jazz, improvisation, and professional music life in Los Angeles during his childhood. (Early home and local performances; formative exposure rather than specific commercial recordings with Flea.) [1970s (childhood and early teens)]
- [[dizzy_gillespie|Dizzy Gillespie]] - Jazz trumpet idol whom Flea admired deeply; meeting Gillespie backstage as a child became one of his greatest early musical memories and reinforced his dedication to music.[2] (Influence centered on Gillespie’s trumpet playing and jazz approach rather than direct collaboration.) [Influence from late 1960s–1970s onward]
- [[miles_davis|Miles Davis]] - Major jazz influence whose recordings helped shape Flea’s early conception of melody, harmony, and improvisation when he aspired to be a jazz trumpeter.[1] (Classic Miles Davis recordings that Flea encountered via his jazz‑oriented upbringing (no direct collaboration).) [Influence throughout Flea’s youth and career]
- [[hillel_slovak|Hillel Slovak]] - High‑school friend and guitarist who invited Flea to join Anthym, encouraged him to switch to bass, and helped him learn the instrument.[2][3] (Anthym performances; early Red Hot Chili Peppers recordings including *The Uplift Mofo Party Plan* (1987).) [Late 1970s–1988]
- [[bootsy_collins|Bootsy Collins]] - Foundational funk bass influence whose flamboyant, rhythmic slap style helped inform Flea’s approach to funk‑rock bass.[1] (Influence drawn from Bootsy’s work with Parliament‑Funkadelic and solo recordings.) [Influence from late 1970s–1980s onward]
- [[larry_graham|Larry Graham]] - Pioneer of slap bass whose techniques strongly inspired Flea’s early aggressive funk style.[1] (Influence from Graham’s work with Sly and the Family Stone and Graham Central Station.) [Influence from late 1970s–1980s onward]

### Key Collaborators
- [[anthony_kiedis|Anthony Kiedis]] - Vocalist, lyricist, and co‑founder of Red Hot Chili Peppers; Flea’s longtime creative partner since their teenage years.[1][2] (All major Red Hot Chili Peppers albums and tours from the band’s 1983 formation onward.) [Early 1980s–present]
- [[hillel_slovak|Hillel Slovak]] - Original Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist and key figure in shaping the band’s early funk‑punk sound alongside Flea.[1][2] (*Freaky Styley* (1985), *The Uplift Mofo Party Plan* (1987) and early RHCP demos and performances.) [Early 1980s–1988]
- [[jack_irons|Jack Irons]] - Original drummer of Red Hot Chili Peppers and earlier bandmate in Anthym; part of Flea’s core early rhythm section.[1][2] (Early RHCP recordings including *The Uplift Mofo Party Plan* (1987).) [Late 1970s–1988 (with later brief returns)]
- [[john_frusciante|John Frusciante]] - Guitarist whose interplay with Flea defined several of RHCP’s most acclaimed eras; together they crafted many of the band’s signature songs. (*Mother’s Milk* (1989), *Blood Sugar Sex Magik* (1991), *Californication* (1999), *By the Way* (2002), *Stadium Arcadium* (2006) and later albums after his returns.) [1988–1992; 1998–2009; 2019–present]
- [[chad_smith|Chad Smith]] - Drummer whose powerful groove has locked in with Flea’s bass since he joined RHCP, forming the band’s long‑running rhythm section. (All Red Hot Chili Peppers albums from *Mother’s Milk* (1989) onward (excepting early work before his arrival).) [1988–present]
- [[george_clinton|George Clinton]] - Producer and funk legend who worked closely with the band during the mid‑1980s, helping refine their funk‑rock aesthetic and studio sound.[1] (Producer of RHCP’s album *Freaky Styley* (1985).) [Mid‑1980s]
- [[river_phoenix|River Phoenix]] - Close friend and actor with whom Flea also made music; Flea played bass for Phoenix’s band Aleka’s Attic and co‑starred with him on film.[2] (Aleka’s Attic track “Note to a Friend” (Flea on bass); film *My Own Private Idaho* (1991).) [Late 1980s–early 1990s]
- [[nirvana_kurt_cobain_and_band_members|Nirvana (Kurt Cobain and band members)]] - Friendly contemporaries on the early 1990s alternative rock circuit; Flea guested with the band live on at least one occasion.[2] (Live performance where Flea played trumpet on “Smells Like Teen Spirit.”[2]) [Early 1990s]

### Artists Influenced
- [[contemporary_rock_and_funkrock_bassists|Contemporary rock and funk‑rock bassists]] - Flea’s slap‑driven yet melodic funk‑rock style is widely cited by modern bass players as a model for combining technical flair with strong songcraft, making him one of the most influential bassists of his generation.[1] (Influence radiates most clearly from RHCP albums such as *Blood Sugar Sex Magik* (1991) and *Californication* (1999), which became reference points for rock bass playing.[1]) [1990s–present]
