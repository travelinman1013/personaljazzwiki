## Biography
Steve Rosenbloom is a Montreal-based alto and soprano saxophonist, jazz composer, and bandleader who has maintained a dual career as both a creative musician and a licensed psychoanalyst and psychology professor at McGill University's Department of Psychiatry. Beginning his compositional work in the mid-1980s, Rosenbloom has been an active performer on the Montreal jazz scene for over 25 years, establishing himself as a committed voice in Canadian jazz through his dedication to the big band idiom. His career has been marked by a unique ability to balance his professional work in mental health with his artistic pursuits, allowing him to develop a distinctive compositional voice that honors the traditions of big band jazz while infusing contemporary sensibilities.

Throughout his career, Rosenbloom has built an impressive discography that demonstrates his evolution as a composer and arranger. His early collaborative albums include works with major Canadian jazz musicians such as Wray Downes, Dave Turner, and Guido Basso on projects like "Last Call at Café Alto" (1994), "Midnight Martini" (1998), and "Deditations" (2000), the latter two released on Justin Time Records. He has also recorded six CDs with the Claremont Standards Band, three albums with fellow composer Richard Karmel, appeared on singer Mira Choquette's "Something Cool," and led the Steve Rosenbloom Vocal Jazz Quartet. His most significant project to date is the 2024 album "San Francisco 1948," recorded with a 16-17 piece big band ensemble, which represents a personal milestone as one of the rare big band albums featuring compositions exclusively written by a single individual.

Rosenbloom's artistic philosophy centers on the synthesis of historical big band traditions with modern compositional complexity. His work reflects decades of mentorship and collaboration, beginning with early guidance from Gerry Danovitch and continuing through partnerships with accomplished arrangers Christopher Smith, Michael Johancsik, and Alex Francoeur. The "San Francisco 1948" project exemplifies his commitment to sustaining and evolving the big band tradition, assembling Montreal's finest jazz musicians to create arrangements that blend bold brass voicings with intricate reed textures, showcasing his keen understanding of orchestration and ensemble interplay.
