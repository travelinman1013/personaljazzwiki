## Biography
Houston Stackhouse (born Houston Goff, September 28, 1910, Wesson, Mississippi) was a pivotal figure in the Delta blues tradition, renowned for his guitar work and mentorship rather than commercial success. Raised on the Randall Ford Plantation by James Wade Stackhouse, he only learned the details of his parentage when applying for a passport later in life. As a teenager, he moved with his family to Crystal Springs, Mississippi, where he was inspired by local musicians and records by Blind Blake, Blind Lemon Jefferson, and Lonnie Johnson. Stackhouse began performing throughout the Delta in the late 1930s, collaborating with members of the Mississippi Sheiks, Robert Johnson, Charlie McCoy, and Walter Vinson.[1][6][7][8]

Stackhouse's career was deeply intertwined with the region's blues scene. He taught guitar to his distant cousin Robert Nighthawk, who would later back Stackhouse on recordings in the late 1960s as a gesture of gratitude. Stackhouse was also a fan of Tommy Johnson, frequently covering his songs. In 1946, he moved to Helena, Arkansas, joining Nighthawk’s band and performing on KFFA radio. After splitting from Nighthawk, Stackhouse became a regular on the influential 'King Biscuit Time' radio program, working with James "Peck" Curtis, Joe Willie Wilkins, Pinetop Perkins, and Robert Traylor. He continued performing locally into the 1960s, collaborating with Frank Frost, Boyd Gilmore, and Baby Face Turner, and recorded with Sonny Boy Williamson II for Arhoolie Records.[1][2][6]

Stackhouse never relocated to the North like many contemporaries, remaining a fixture in the Delta and Memphis blues scenes. He recorded the album 'Cryin' Won't Help You' in 1972 and toured Europe once in 1976. His legacy endures through his teaching and collaborations, notably influencing future blues musicians. The acoustic stage at the annual Arkansas Blues and Heritage Festival is named in his honor, reflecting his lasting impact on the region’s musical heritage.[1][6]
