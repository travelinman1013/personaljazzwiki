## Biography
Dave Stryker (born March 30, 1957) is an American jazz guitarist known for his distinctive tone and versatile playing style. He grew up in Omaha, Nebraska, and moved to New York City in 1980, where he established himself as a prominent figure in the jazz scene. After building his reputation locally, he joined organist Jack McDuff's group from 1984-85, marking the beginning of his professional career. From 1986 to 1995, Stryker played and recorded extensively with tenor saxophonist Stanley Turrentine, a period that significantly shaped his musical development and helped establish him as a featured sideman of note.

Throughout his career, Stryker has become a prolific recording artist and bandleader, releasing 37 CDs as a leader to date. His work spans original compositions and creative reinterpretations of existing material, most notably his "Eight Track" series, which reimagines 1970s pop hits through a jazz lens. Gary Giddins of the Village Voice called him "one of the most distinctive guitarists to come along in recent years." Stryker has maintained a consistent presence in jazz, with recent recordings reaching the top 10 on JazzWeek charts, and he was voted one of the top jazz guitarists in the 2025 Downbeat Poll for the 15th time. Beyond performance, he serves as an adjunct professor of jazz guitar at multiple institutions including Rutgers University, William Paterson University, and Montclair State University, and maintains an online teaching school.
