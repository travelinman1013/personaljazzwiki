## Biography
Betty Harris, born September 9, 1939 in Orlando, Florida, is a celebrated American soul singer whose career flourished in the 1960s. Raised in a religious family with a minister father and missionary mother, Harris was exposed to gospel music from an early age, which shaped her emotive vocal style. As a teenager, she worked for R&B star Big Maybelle, who encouraged her musical ambitions and helped her make her first recordings in 1960[1][2].

Harris's breakthrough came in 1963 when she recorded a slowed-down version of Solomon Burke's 'Cry to Me,' produced by Bert Berns for Jubilee Records. The single reached number 23 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 10 on the R&B chart, establishing Harris as a deep soul vocalist. She followed with other hits such as 'His Kiss' (1964) and, after moving to Sansu Records in New Orleans, 'Nearer to You' (1967), produced by [[01_Projects/PersonalArtistWiki/Artists/Allen_Toussaint]]. Her Sansu recordings, including 'I'm Evil Tonight,' 'Show It,' and 'Twelve Red Roses,' are now considered classics of Southern and Northern soul, admired for their raw yet sophisticated arrangements and Harris's rich, distinctive voice[1][2][4].

Despite her critical acclaim, Harris retired from performing in 1970 to focus on her family, remaining largely unaware of the growing cult following for her music among soul aficionados. Her work was later rediscovered and celebrated, especially in the UK, where the 1969 anthology 'Soul Perfection' became a sought-after collector's item. Harris's legacy lies in her ability to convey deep emotion through her vocals, her collaborations with legendary figures like Bert Berns and Allen Toussaint, and her influence on subsequent generations of soul and R&B artists[1][2][4].

## Fun Facts
- Betty Harris abruptly retired from music in 1970 and rumors circulated that she became James Carr's road manager and even drove a tractor-trailer, though she actually focused on raising her family and sang in her church choir[1].
- Her 1969 UK-only anthology 'Soul Perfection' is a prized collector's item, sometimes selling for $200–$300 in vinyl format[2].
- Harris was unaware of her cult status among soul fans until her daughter discovered fan sites online in the early 2000s, prompting her musical comeback[4].
- She began offering vocal lessons after settling in Hartford, Connecticut in 1997[1].
