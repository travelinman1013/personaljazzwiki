## Biography
Rudy Green (born Rudolph Spencer Greene, 1926–1976) was an American guitarist and singer known for his energetic blend of rhythm and blues and early rock 'n' roll. Born in Lake Charles, Louisiana, Green began his musical journey in the mid-1940s, quickly establishing himself as a skilled blues guitarist influenced by the pioneering electric guitar work of T-Bone Walker. His early recordings for Nashville's Bullett Records in 1946–1947 showcased a jump blues style that reflected the vibrant postwar R&B scene.

Throughout the 1950s, Green's career took him to Chicago and Nashville, where he recorded for several independent labels, including Chance Records, Club 51 Records, Excello Records, and Ember Records. He was known for his dynamic stage presence and collaborations with notable musicians, such as saxophonist Eddie Chamblee. Green's most recognized track, 'Juicy Fruit,' released in 1957 on Ember Records, exemplified his raw, driving approach to black rock 'n' roll and has since appeared on numerous genre compilations. Despite limited commercial success during his lifetime, Green's recordings have gained posthumous recognition among collectors and historians of early R&B and rockabilly.

Green's musical style was characterized by a fusion of blues guitar technique, jump blues rhythms, and the emerging energy of rock 'n' roll. His legacy endures as a representative of the overlooked but foundational artists who bridged the gap between postwar rhythm and blues and the birth of rock 'n' roll.
