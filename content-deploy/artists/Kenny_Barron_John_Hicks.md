## Biography
Kenny Barron, born in 1943 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, is celebrated as one of the most influential jazz pianists of his generation. He began playing piano at age twelve and quickly established himself on the Philadelphia jazz scene, performing professionally as a teenager with Mel Melvin’s orchestra alongside his brother, saxophonist Bill Barron. By high school, Barron was already working with drummer Philly Joe Jones, and at 19, he moved to New York City, where he freelanced with such luminaries as Roy Haynes, Lee Morgan, and James Moody. It was Moody who recommended Barron to Dizzy Gillespie, leading to a pivotal five-year tenure in Gillespie’s band that exposed Barron to Latin and Caribbean rhythms and broadened his musical palette.

Throughout the 1970s and beyond, Barron’s career flourished as he collaborated with jazz greats including Freddie Hubbard, Stanley Turrentine, Milt Jackson, Buddy Rich, and Yusef Lateef, the latter of whom deeply influenced Barron’s approach to improvisation. Barron balanced an active touring and recording schedule with a distinguished academic career, joining the Rutgers University faculty in 1973 and mentoring a new generation of jazz artists until 2000. As a leader, Barron has released over 40 albums, renowned for their lyrical melodies, technical mastery, and elegant style, earning him accolades such as the National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master award and recognition from The Los Angeles Times as one of the world’s top jazz pianists.

Barron’s musical style is marked by sensitive melodies, impeccable technique, and a deep sense of swing, making him a sought-after collaborator and a revered figure in jazz education. His legacy is reflected not only in his extensive discography and collaborations but also in the many students and musicians he has inspired throughout his ongoing career.
