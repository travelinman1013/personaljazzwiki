## Biography
Miles Davis (1926–1991) was a visionary American jazz trumpeter, composer, and bandleader, widely regarded as one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century. Born into a middle-class family in Alton, Illinois, Davis began trumpet lessons at age 13, guided by his father's encouragement and the tutelage of Elwood Buchanan, who instilled a distinctive, vibrato-free style. After early professional gigs in St. Louis, Davis moved to New York in 1944 to attend Juilliard but quickly immersed himself in the city's vibrant jazz scene, performing with icons like Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie. 

Davis's career was marked by continual innovation and reinvention. In the late 1940s, he led the nonet that recorded 'Birth of the Cool,' pioneering the cool jazz movement. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, he assembled groundbreaking ensembles, including his first great quintet with John Coltrane and his second great quintet featuring Herbie Hancock and Wayne Shorter. Davis's embrace of modal jazz led to the seminal album 'Kind of Blue' (1959), and his later experiments with electric instruments and rock rhythms produced the influential jazz fusion album 'Bitches Brew' (1970). Despite struggles with addiction and a period of semi-retirement in the 1970s, Davis returned in the 1980s, continuing to push musical boundaries until his death in 1991.

Davis's legacy is profound: he shaped the course of jazz through bebop, cool jazz, hard bop, modal jazz, and fusion, mentoring and collaborating with generations of jazz greats. His restless creativity and willingness to challenge conventions made him a central figure in jazz history, and his recordings remain touchstones for musicians and listeners worldwide.
